        <h1>Monday 17th November</h1>
        <p>A dry, sunny(ish), but cold day. I wasn't cold by winter standards, but it was a big drop in temperature from yesterday. While Angela went to her Monday club, I opened a NS&I bond for her, paying £72,000 into it.</p>
        <p>I experimented with MS Copilot to summarise the slide deck on railway signaling. The summary was too short to be of use, so I started removing some images from the slides and putting them into a report of the talk for the next RCEA newsletter. I also added some text.</p>
