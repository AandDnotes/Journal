        <h1>Monday 24th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday Club I finished the report on railway signalling and sent a pdf copy to Mike W for review. Then I walked to the Health Centre to collect my repeat prescription and then went on to Sims to arrange to take it in for them to look at the headlight adjustment. I was surprised when ask to take it in tomorrow!</p>
        <p>When I got home I put some bread on to bake. It was a pity that I failed to put any yeast in it! So I had to make some more.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I went into the garage, put a fan heater in the B, took more photos and checked the tyre pressures before trying to fit the hood. After something of a struggle I managed to get the hood partially fixed. Later I found a YouTube video that shows parts of the frame being moved to loosen and stretch the hood. So I'll investigate further tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela went to give blood, which this time was taken. Her arm was hurting, so I helped cook dinner.</p>
