        <h1>Saturday 29th November</h1>
        <p>A long and tiring day, at least for me. I left home just before 8:30 to drive to Mike W's. He then took me to Lewis Town Hall for the STEM fair. It was raining when I left home, but had stopped by the time we got to Lweis. The fair was very busy all day, even with four of us. I got home just after 4:30.</p>
        <p>Angela had been to the High Street to buy a newspaper. When I got home we spoke with Victoria briefly (for her) since they are in Lees Summit and the girls were about to go off to see the Nutcracker.</p>
        <p>To my surprise the parts I ordered from the MGOC arrived today.</p>
