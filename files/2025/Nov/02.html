        <h1>Sunday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>After heavy rain over night and into the early hours the sun cam out before Angela went to church and stayed out for most of the day.</p>
        <p>I did more research on the structure of MGBs and added to my list of things to examine when we view one on Tuesday. I also put Mike W's report on the last talk into the draft of the December newsletter. However, my notes cover items that he doesn't mension, so I will have to see if I can merge them.</p>
        <p>Immediately after lunch we spoke with Victoria. They got into their new house on Friday and went round it with a builder on Saturday. They will try to get most of the work done before they physically move.</p>
        <p>Later we also spoke with Paul.</p>
