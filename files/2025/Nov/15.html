        <h1>Saturday 15th November</h1>
        <p>We started with our walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper, plus a few other things. It was a pity that I forgot to take my repeat prescription with us, so I had to go down to the health centre later.</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts and updated our 'gifts' spreadsheet. After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They still don't have any prices for the work they want to have done on the new house, but it looks as though it going to get very expensive.</p>
        <p>Later I went into the garage to look at the strimmer. I managed to remove the final screw and take the whole thing apart. The battery was fine, the switch was fine, the wiring to the motor was fine, so it has to be a problem with the motor. Unfortunately the motor is sealed, so I couldn't check the windings. I put it all back together and will check the price of a new motor, but I suspect that, if available, it will be too expensive.</p>
