        <h1>Monday 10th November</h1>
        <p>The first of three very busy days. While Angela went off to help set up the lunch club (although she was not cooking or on the rota to help) I dismantled the toaster that I'd brought home from the Repair Cafe on Saturday. Having cleaned the contacts and partially re-assembled it (without the outer cover) it worked. So either the contacts were dirty or the small connectors to the control board had worked loose. It still worked after completely re-assembling it.</p>
        <p>I joined Angela at 12:30 to help take the money from those attending the lunch club and to help clear up afterwards. We got home at about 3:30.</p>
        <p>After a small tea we went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. Fran F-B ran a quiz and I was able to talk to a couple of MGB owners about rust-prevention treatments. So quite a good evening, although I'm not sure that Angela enjoyed it quite as much!</p>
