        <h1>Wednesday 26th November</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but very cold day. With frost still on the ground, Angela went off walking with her friends. Three walked and another four (under the weather) joined them at the Hub. Meanwhile, I emailed Milestone Classics (Carly) to ask for a copy of the text about the B that was on their web site, so that I could put it on my new MGB web site. She replied very quickly with the text. I also paid for our RCEA Christmas lunch.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I went into the garage to check the water level in the B and to adjust the tyre pressures. After reading https://www.mgb-stuff.org.uk I decided to lower the tyre pressures a little, to 24psi front and 27psi rear. Later I took the B for a run, up to Partridge Green and down through Henfield, 16 miles in total. I still had trouble getting into 2nd gear.</p>
        <p>Later still I 'played' with my draft MGB home page, adding the text from Milestone Classics.</p>
