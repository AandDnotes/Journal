        <h1>Tuesday 25th November</h1>
        <p>After breakfast, and before I used the bathroom, I took the Panda to Sims to get them to look at the headlight load adjusting mechanism. They investigated it, but couldn't find anything wrong! I colleccted the car later in the evening and the headlight adjustment worked. Sims didn't charge for the investigation.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street, I added George W's Presidents Chritsmas Message and then the comments that Mike W made on my railway signalling report. I now just need to add the forthcoming events section.</p>
        <p>Later I went into the garage to look at the B's hood. At first I couldn't see any part of the frame that could be moved, but after lubricating all the joints I found that the forward rail did move. However, the main change was to turn over the rear rail. It had been put in upside down so that the curve in it matched the shape of the body. I put the fan heater inside again and was able to close the hood, even though I couldn't move that forward rail. I also put some black insulation tape on both sides of the small hole in the material. However, I don't think it will stay stuck.</p>
