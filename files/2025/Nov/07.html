        <h1>Friday 7th November</h1>
        <p>A busy day with light rain at the begining and end. We started by going to Halfords in Shoreham to buy a new tyre for my bike. From there we went into Dunelm for coffee and a little look around.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the High Street to buy one or two things and I paid the deposit for the MGB. Then I went into the garage, removed the rear wheel of my bike, removed the old tyre and fitted the new tyre. Then I re-fitted the rear wheel to the bike. All the gears seem to work, but it really needs a test ride.</p>
