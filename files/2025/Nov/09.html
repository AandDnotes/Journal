        <h1>Sunday 9th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I charged all the batteries for the video camera and microphones for Tuesday's IET talk. Then I took a photo of the 'space in the garage' and completed a first draft of an article about buying the MGB. I now just need a photo of the car once I've taken delivery.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
