        <h1>Saturday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>It was the Christmas Bazaar at the Methodist Church today, so Angela was up early making a roulard and left at about 9:15. I went to the High Street a little later to buy a newspaper before going on the Bazaar to sell lunch tickets. It was spitting with rain when I went down and we got very wet in heavier rain on the way home. But a least it was a little warmer.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria. They were at their new house, so she gave us a tour. They have many decisions to make about what changes remediation they want to do.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening I started looking a the B's file of invoices, etc.</p>
