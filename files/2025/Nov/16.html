        <h1>Sunday 16th November</h1>
        <p>A grey, but dry day, with a developing cold northerly wind. So it felt much colder. Whhile Angela went to church, I checked that a matured bond had been split between a new bond and (the majority) put into our current account. My aim is to open an NS&I bond in Angela's name, but, since the date of the transaction was tomorrow, I decided to wait until tomorrow to open the new bond.</p>
        <p>Since it is the motor that seems to be broken in the strimmer that I brought home from the Repair Cafe, I tried to find a replacement. However, no one seems to offer one. The owner did not answer their phone, so I left a message.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleaned the front door with some dilute washing up liquid, rinsed and then dry it. Then I applied some of the colour restorer that arrived yesterday. I was surprised to find that, after shaking it, it was like a white foam. I used less than half the small bottle, applying it with a rag and then wiping it over. The door looks like new.</p>
        <p>I spent some time during the day working on my MG web sites. Then, as usual on a Sunday, we had a short chat with Paul.</p>
