        <h1>Monday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club, I did the monthly accounts. I had trouble getting into Angela's RBS account to check on a bond that I thought should have matured. When Angela got home and found the correct login details we found that it matures later this month.</p>
        <p>Later I started producing a start slide for the next IET talk and created a blog entry about it on EngX.</p>
