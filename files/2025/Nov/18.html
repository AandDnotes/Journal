        <h1>Tuesday 18th November</h1>
        <p>It rained around lunch time, but was dry otherwise. It was also noticably colder. Angela walked to the High Street (twice) to buy a few things. I spent most of the morning adding some text to my MGB web site. I now need a photo of the car at home and details of its collection.</p>
        <p>Later I added to the report on railway signalling. Still quite a lot to do though. Then, after dinner I attended the IET Sussex committee meeting via Teams. So I didn't go out all day!</p>
