        <h1>Friday 14th November</h1>
        <p>A miserable, mainly wet day. Neither of us went out, apart from to the garage. I modified the IET Sussex programme of events and uploaded it to the web site. I also added a note about giving a talk.</p>
        <p>I started putting together some web pages about my MG cars, one page that links the existing TC site and a new MGB site, then the first page of the new site.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage and started looking at the strimmer that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. It looked as though it had never been cleaned, so having removed a mat of old grass I tried to get it apart. While the battery was charging I opened the handle end and checked the switch, which seems fine. However, there is one screw at the business end that I can't get out. I'll try again tomorrow.</p>
