        <h1>Thursday 13th November</h1>
        <p>We made our usual trip to Lyons Farm to do our weekly shop in Lidl and Sainsbury's, before going on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>The owner of the toaster called to pick it up. I showed it working and she will make an online donation. So I Whatsapped Robin.</p>
        <p>I generated an IET Sussex 2025/26 prgramme of events pdf document. I will put it on our web page tomorrow.</p>
