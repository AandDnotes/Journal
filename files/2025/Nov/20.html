        <h1>Thursday 20th November</h1>
        <p>Grocery shopping day, although we got everything on the list in Lidl. So we were a little early going on to Findon Vale for a cup of coffee. When we got home I put some sheets of cardboard on the garage floor in anticipation of a leaky engine. We then left at 1:30 for Milestone Classics. The MGB was outside, with the roof down! The hood cover was fitted. So after getting the keys (and a receipt) I drove the car home. I'm struggling with both the seat belt and getting into second gear, but some investigation and some practice will hopefully help.</p>
        <p>It was quite a cold journey, but I took a photo of the car on our drive and later uploaded it to our Google Photos site. I also sent a small version of the photo to Patrick. I need to find out how raise and lower the hood. There is a full toneau cover in the boot.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week Anthony had emailed Alan and I about a chat he had with Martin. So later I sent an email to Martin (copied to the other two) about the sale of the TC and the purchase of the MGB, including the photo.</p>
        <p>The handbook that Jamie provided is for the next model, so I will have to look for an appropriate one. I also had a look at the `Haynes manual`, since I don't know anything about the dashboard controls (without my reading glasses on I can't see the symbols). I've not yet started to look at the file of invoices.</p>
        <p>In between all this I added another section to the report on railway signalling.</p>
