        <h1>Wednesday 5th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her friends as usual on a Wednesday and I spent most of the morning replying to email. I also tried to fix a small IET torch, but it does not seem to be made to take apart.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly grocery shop, since I am out tomorrow morning and then again in the afternoon. So we went into Lidl and then into Sainsbury's.</p>
        <p>After dinner I set off to the Steyning Centre for 'film night'. I got as far as the top of the path from Jarvis Lane when a couple came up and said that the film had been cancelled. It seems that the projectionist is ill! So I walked home.</p>
