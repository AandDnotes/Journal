        <h1>Saturday 8th November</h1>
        <p>A quiet, dry and partly sunnyday. WE took our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. Then I put my tools together for the afternoon before I did the weekly accounts. It so happened that the bank statement arrived this morning, so I was able to reconcile that against my spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went off to Beeding Village Hall to the Repair Cafe. It was very busy, perhaps because it was the last of the year. We had people waiting. We were all invited to go for a drink, but I decided not to go, since we were late packing up and we were expecting to talk with Victoria. As it was, I brought two items home, a battery strimmer and a toaster.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening we spoke with Victoria. Brandon was blowing leaves off the patio and Austin was mowing them up. They plan to do the same at their new house.</p>
