        <h1>Sunday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church (in the rain) I did the weekly accounts and then made good progress on the railway signalling report. I just have the summary to add.</p>
        <p>The clouds cleared after lunch and we had some sunshine. I used a piece of electrical cable to clear the blockage in the kitchen sink. I put 'drain buster' down the drain last night, but it made little difference. This suggests that the blockage is in the pipe from the sink to the U-bend and the cable trick seems to support that.</p>
        <p>I created a version of the B's photo with a lighter bluring of the background and also went into the garage. I found the B's radio front in the central storage bin. Unfortunately the rear hinge came unscrewed, so I had to fix it.</p>
        <p>Angela replied to an email from Kate, sending her a photo of my B. Later we spoke to Paul. Krista has been unwell all week.</p>
