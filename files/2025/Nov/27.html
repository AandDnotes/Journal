        <h1>Thursday 27th November</h1>
        <p>The day started overcast, although a little milder, but then deteriorated, first into drizzle and then into rain. As we left home in the Panda this morning on our way to Lidl in Shoreham, there was a warning triangle illuminated on the dashboard. When we got to Lidle we found that the nearside front daylight running light had broken. Not too much of a problem to fix, or so I thought.</p>
        <p>After doing all our grocery shopping in Lidl we went to Dunelm to buy some oven gloves. Of course, we had coffee whilst there. Then we went on to Tesco to get petrol, but we decided to stop first at M&amp;S, just to look around. Angela bought some pants and I bought a vest (T-shirt). Then I got petrol.</p>
        <p>After lunch I replaced the broken bulb. The instructions in the handbook did not match the car and to reach the nearside DRL I had to remove part of the air intake. Luckily I had a spare bulb. Then I looked at the B's seat belt, that had again failed to retract. I moved the belt to the outermost slot. So we will see what happens. I also investigated the catch on the centre storage bin. The pin is broken; still attached but bendy. I also tried to put a little lubrication on the driver's seat runners, but could only reach the very front.</p>
