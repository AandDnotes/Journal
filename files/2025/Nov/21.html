        <h1>Friday 21st November</h1>
        <p>A sunny, calm, cold and tiring day. We heard on the radio over breakfast the the White Bridge was to be officially openned at 10:30. So we set off, a bit late, to the Steyning end of the bridge. The openning was taking place at the Bramber end! After the ribon cutting we walked to the Hub for coffee. Then Angela walked home since she had to get to Fylis's by one. I walked on to the pharmacy to get my pres ription. However they had not yet dispenced it. So I will go back on Monday. By the time I got home, just before Angela left, I was exhausted.</p>
        <p>Before we went out I got MS Copilot to blur the background of my photo of the B on the drive. I was quite impressed.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, when Angela was following me in the Panda, I noticed that both headlights were high. So, during this afternoon. I looked at the problem. As I tried to raise and lower the headlights I could hear the motors whirring, but the headlight line did not move. I couldn't remove a motor to inspect the drive, so we will need to take it to Simms.</p>
        <p>Then I tried to raise the B's hood. I removed the hood cover, but couldn't fit the hood to its anchorage points. Since it was so cold I think the vinyl wouldn't stretch enough. So I will wait until it is warmer (or warm it). However, I fixed the driver's side retractable seatbelt, simply by moving the belt into the right slot.</p>
        <p>Later I put together the files for my 'Space in the Garage' article and sent it to Roger.</p>
