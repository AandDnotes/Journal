        <h1>Wednesday 19th November</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up and it seemed that only Angela and Felicity wanted to go walking. So Angela went to Felicity's for coffee instead! However, for me the day was quite busy.</p>
        <p>During the morning I found a voice message from Carly Cripps to say that the car was ready for collection. I phoned and spoke to Jamie, arranging to go over there tomorrow afternoon. Then I arranged insurance (the first set of documents that were sent had the wrong registration number). The MGB was added to the Panda and I printed the certificate and the rescue certificate from the earlier documents. I also transferred the balance to the Milestone accounts. Later I received an email from the DVLA to say that I now owned the MG.</p>
        <p>In between all this I did a little more to the report on railway signaling. At one point mail on the iMac complained that there was not enough disc space. After I deleted some old IET talk recordings all seemed well.</p>
