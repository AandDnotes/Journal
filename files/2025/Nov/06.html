        <h1>Thursday 6th November</h1>
        <p>Today was almost as momentus as October 21st when we sold the TC. But that was later.</p>
        <p>Just after nine I was picked up by Mike W and taken to Durrington for the RCEA committee meeting. Luckily I didn't get any actions.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drove over to Milestone Classics ad was taken for a drive in the MGB. Then I had a drive. All seemed well, although I had difficulty finding the right gear. But everything was smooth, synchro was good on all gears, overdrive worked on both third and fourth and the steering was very positive. Also, the car stayed in a straight line.</p>
        <p>The asking price was £13K, so I offered £11K and settled on £12K. I left Jamie my details and he said that Carley would email me an invoice. Since the dashboard veneer was damaged and the glovebox veneer was different to the rest, I asked Jamie to remove it and put it back to the original crinkly black. They will also do a pre-sales check of everything. It will take about a week and a half before I can take delivery.</p>
