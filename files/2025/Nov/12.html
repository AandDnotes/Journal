        <h1>Wednesday 12th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking group, well, there were two of them, while I was picked up by David F-B to join the rest of the Sussex Wanderers at the Bolney Stage. After coffee we did a circular tour on mainly A and B roads, plus a lane of two, before returning to the Bolney Stage for lunch. David had a dental appointment, so we had to leave promptly. I was home at two thirty.</p>
        <p>Later I phoned the owner of the toaster that I fixed and arranged for her to pick it up tomorrow afternoon.</p>
