        <h1>Saturday 1st November</h1>
        <p>The morning was sunny, if not that warm. As part of our usual trip to the High Street on a Saturday to buy a newspaper we called in to the Steyning Centre to look around craft stalls and then the local art exhibition. We met Mike and Chris W looking at the paintings.</p>
        <p>Milestone Classics replied, suggesting we visit on Tuesday moring to view the MGB. We said yes.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we cleaned the bicycles. I discovered that the rear tyre on my bike has two splits near the rim. So I will need to replace it.</p>
