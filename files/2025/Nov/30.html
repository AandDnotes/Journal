        <h1>Sunday 30th November</h1>
        <p>My list of things to do today was longer than I had time during the day. While Angela was at church I did the weekly accounts. I also set the maturity options for an ISA with Paragon. Although that was easily done online, it took longer than expected since I found that I'd failed to record an adition to the ISA when it was last renewed.</p>
        <p>Mike W had sent the photos that he took at the Lewis STEM Fair yesterday. I cropped one for use on the IET Sussex website and firstly asked MS Copilit to blur the faces of children. After a while it replied that it couldn't do it, but offered a list of free online tools that could do it. I used one of them to blur children's and an adult's face.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I also created a spreadsheet to record parts, etc. for the B, since I'd bought two new rubber stops for the bonnet and a new clip for the centre bin. After lunch I went into the garage and fitted the two rubber stops. The holes on the off-side matched the new fitting, but I had to elongate the holes to make the one on the near-side fit.</p>
        <p>When I came in we spoke with Paul.</p>
