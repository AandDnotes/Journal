        <h1>Tuesday 11th November</h1>
        <p>The busiest of the three busy days this weeks. Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to bank some cash from the lunch club. I went to the dentist for a check-up. All was well.</p>
        <p>After lunch Peter W picked me up and drove me to Field Place for an RCEA talk on railway signalling, which includes the control of points. He will supply the slides, so I only made scant notes. Then it was home for half an hour before going off to Crawley College to record the IET Sussex talk on cyber security. Unfortunately we later found out that UK Power Networks will not let us publish it! I got home at half past nine.</p>
