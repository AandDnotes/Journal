        <h1>Friday 28th November</h1>
        <p>As she often does, Angela went down to the High Street to buy a couple of things for dinner. While she was out I made some name badges for the Lewis STEM fair tomorrow. This took longer than I thought it would since I'm sure I already had a file somewhere. But I couldn't find it.</p>
        <p>I joined the MG Owners Club and then later ordered new parts of clip for the centre console bin, along with two bonnet rubbers. I went into the garage, checked the brake and clutch fluid levels and looked underneath the car. There seems to be a bit of an oil leak from the back of the engine (or perhaps the gearbox). The underseal looks mainly in tact, with just a few spots that are flaking. I also worked through the B's file and noted all the MOT details that I found.</p>
        <p>Later I experimented with Google Antigravity, which can produce simulations. However, it need Google Chome, so I deleted it.</p>
