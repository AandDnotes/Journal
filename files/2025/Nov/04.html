        <h1>Tuesday 4th November</h1>
        <p>This morning we drove over to Milestone Classics at Wissborough Green to view a 1972 green MGB. The road from Ashington was closed, so we had to go up to Buckbarn and go down the A272.</p>
        <p>The car was at the back corner of a very full garage. I checked the items on my list, apart from those that required it being driven. So far it is looking good although we found that it had stated out being blue! I arranged to return on Thursday afternoon to go out in it.</p>
        <p>After lunch I added some points to Mike W's report on the 'AI in process control' and sent it to him for review.</p>
        <p>Later I attended an online CC-UK meeting. I'm not sure we achieved anything, except agreeing that we can pick up our work groups, at least for the time being.</p>
