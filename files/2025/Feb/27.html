        <h1>Thursday 27th February</h1>
        <p>A bright and fairly calm day. We started by going off to do our weekly grocery shop at Lyons Farm. Since there were fairly long queues at the checkouts we, unusually, used the self-checkout. It wasn't without its difficulties.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee and to buy some birthday cards. We got home just in time to make lunch.</p>
        <p>Later, while I made notes on controlling email from the IET, Angela washed the very dirty Panda. Then I went into the garage and checked the brakes on the front wheels. The off side wheel was fine (apart from one rivet on a brake shoe that needs hammering down), but the near side wheel brake cylinder has been leaking, so everything was 'wet'. It was five years ago that I replaced all the seals.</p>
