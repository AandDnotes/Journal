        <h1>Saturday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>We made our usual Saturday morning trip to the High Street to buy a newspaper and, this time, some grapes and potatoes. I then did the weekly accounts, which didn't take a lot of effort. Following that, I did some more work on the RCEA newsletter report for the talk on water engineering.</p>
        <p>Angela went to a St Barnabas meeting about their planned beetle drive and, a little later, I went off to the chiropodist. We were both home late for lunch and ate it whilst talking with Victoria. They still have snow!</p>
        <p>I had quite a lesson from Andrew Jenkins about filing toenails and treating both fungal nail and athletes foot. It seems that only four of my toenails have fungal nail, the other thick ones are due to 'damage'. He reduced the thickness of my big-toe nails and files them all to be 'toe shaped', with a slope downwards to reduce the chance of catching them and thus damaging them. He also recommended using Lamasil spray for both fungal nail and athletes foot, using surgical spirit every day to dry between the toes and reduce the change of athletes foot. I also bought a nail file from him.</p>
