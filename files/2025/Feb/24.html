        <h1>Monday 24th February</h1>
        <p>The day was a mirror image of yesterday, that is, wet in the morning and dry and bright in the afternoon. Angela went of (in the rain) to her woman's group, while I replied to Rowan about the family tree on our web site and added a photo to my page. I also tried to set the maturity option on a maturing ISA, only to find that I can't do it until tomorrow! Another small job before lunch was to add a couple of references to my (practically non-existent) notes for a talk on SMRs/AMRs.</p>
        <p>Whilst out this morning, Angela had also bought some rolls and tried to get some surgical spirit, but the pharmacy didn't have any. So after lunch we walked, in the sunshine, to the Beeding pharmacy, who did have some. The rest of the afternoon was spent sitting down and reading the paper. However, I did email a member of the mg-tabc forum who, last month, had said he had an inlet manifold and air filter going spare. He replied quickly, but unfortunately had sold it. So I posted my interest on the mg-tabc forum. Since a new one from NTG costs about Â£740, I suspect that, if anyone has one, they will be asking too much.</p>
