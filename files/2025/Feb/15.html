        <h1>Saturday 15th February</h1>
        <p>We actually had some sunshine today, although it was still cold. As usual on a Saturday we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then, after a spell reading the paper, I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I made a 'start slide' for the IET talk on Tuesday and put it at the start of my slide set. I also tested that the MackBook would show the correct screens when connected via an HDMI cable (in this case to the TV).</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria. They went out early so as to miss the next snow shower. Victoria and Juniper have bought ice skates (second hand ones), but have yet to try them.</p>
