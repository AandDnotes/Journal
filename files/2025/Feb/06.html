        <h1>Thursday 6th February</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, mostly in the sunshine. We started by doing our weekly grocery shop at Lyons Farm. I also took the old HP laptop and a couple of timers to Argos for recycling. We then went on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk before doing our Dutch lesson. We walked through Clay's Field, through Bramber, along the river, back along the Downs link and up Maudlin Lane and Home. We were out for about an hour and a half. When we got back I updated the IET Sussex events programme and uploaded it to the web home page.</p>
