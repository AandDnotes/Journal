        <h1>Wednesday 19th February</h1>
        <p>A grey and still chilly day today, although it became slightly warmer as the day went on. Angela started by going walking with the 'walking group' around the lower Horseshoe. Apparently it was very muddy.</p>
        <p>I had a Teams call with Paul B, which was more about a general 'put the world (IET) to right' than our main task which was to progress our task to produce a good practice guide on Local Network event metrics. We decided to get an email sent to LN Chairs asking them to 'tick' a number of items. I agreed to produce a draft. I also replied to both Mike W and Ramon about IET email and text for the YouTube upload.</p>
        <p>After lunch I joined an IET 'listening session' and later put some notes on the CC-UK WhatsApp group. Later I started preparing images for a document about the Sussex LN talk venues.</p>
