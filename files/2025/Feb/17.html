        <h1>Monday 17th February</h1>
        <p>The sun was trying to shine when we got up and the day soon became one of a clear blue sky until sunset. While Angela went to her Monday club is spent the morning creating the next Adestra email and submitted it. I also sent the draft to Mark C for uploading to LinkedIn and X.</p>
        <p>After lunch I looked at a report on 'The global fusion industry in 2024'. Later I added a slide to my deck for tomorrow's talk.</p>
