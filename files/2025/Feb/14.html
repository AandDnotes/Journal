        <h1>Friday 14th February</h1>
        <p>Since I was out yesterday we went to Lyons Farm this morning to do our weekly grocery shop. I also bought some house numbers from B&amp;Q to stick on our garden waste bin. From there we went to Findon Vale Garden Centre for coffee and to see how their building work was progressing.</p>
        <p>The sun was shining intermittently, but improved after lunch, so we went for a walk before starting our Dutch lessons. I had some correspondence about the 'STEM in the Park' event in Crawley in May and also added a couple of notes to my 'fusion' talk slides.</p>
