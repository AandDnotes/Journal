        <h1>Friday 28th February</h1>
        <p>The last day of meteorological Winter. Roll on Spring! And it was a fine, sunny, calm and not too cold day.</p>
        <p>Angela needed to buy some 'extra thick' cream for tomorrow's Beetle Drive (and cream tea) which, apparently, can only be found at Tesco. So we went off to Holmbush. Angela also wanted to buy a bra (or two) and I wanted to look for a thin fleece to take on holiday to Canada. Eventually Angela chose a bra, which happened to be Â£10, the same as the M&amp;S voucher that I had. So it cost nothing. We also took advantage of the M&amp;S cafe.</p>
        <p>When we got home I booked car parking at Shoreham station on Monday. Later I ordered four brake slave cylinders and three flexible brake hoses for the TC from the MG Octagon Car Club. I had decided overnight to replace them myself, so that I could then clean up the backplate and drum. I will also replace the brake fluid, staying with DOT 4 (rather than moving to silicon) since the master cylinder rubbers have spent the past ten years in DOT 4.</p>
        <p>Later I updated the RCEA 'water engineering' talk write-up with the speaker's amendments and added a little to my notes on the CC-UK 'metrics' workgroup progress. Another job was to set the maturity options for two of our ISAs.</p>
        <p>The news in the evening was quite depressing. Trump and Vance seem to think that they are on a reality TV show, shouting at Zalensky live on TV. Needless to say he left without signing any minerals deal or getting any security guarantee.</p>
