        <h1>Tuesday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Another bright blue sky all day. Angela went to get her reading glasses adjusted and I updated my slides for this evening's talk. I also rehearsed it.</p>
        <p>We had three letters for Paul and Krista, so I sent them scans of part of them.</p>
        <p>Later in the early evening I drove to Falmer and gave my talk on fusion. It seemed to go reasonably well.</p>
