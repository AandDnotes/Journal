        <h1>Saturday 1st February</h1>
        <p>Today followed pretty much the usual route for a Saturday. We started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things, although Angela then went on to the library. In the mean time I started working on the weekly accounts. However, today that included moving money that had come from last year's regular savings account into a Barclays easy access account. I also confirmed what my tax coding had told me, which was that the £1,000 that I was transferring from my personal pension plan into the bank was being taxed at £40%. So I amended the standing order to only move £600 into the savings account each month.</p>
        <p>I did also manage to do a little research on Advanced Modular Reactors. There would seem to be scope to create another talk on SMRs and AMRs for the RCEA. It could include a little history about Magnox and AGR reactors, as well as submarine plant.</p>
        <p>Again as usual, we spoke with Victoria after lunch, again as usual, while she was eating her breakfast. The children seem to be doing well at their new school, although they again have a little snow.</p>
        <p>Later I spent more time trying to complete the backup of files on the iMac. I realised that the Photos export had removed the Albumn structure and was just a set of images</p>
