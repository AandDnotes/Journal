        <h1>Tuesday 11th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went of on the bus to Storrington to bank cash from yesterday's lunch club. I closed my Adestra campaign, added the registration link and re-submitted it. Unfortunately that confused Sam B and then she rejected it because the registration page does not open until tomorrow!</p>
        <p>I then spent most of the rest of the morning looking at things related to Thursday's FLL at Gatwick. Unfortunately they want us all there by 8:15! I also had a quick look at David F-B's CD player. Three CDs wouldn't play, so I cleaned the lens with a spectacle cleaner. They still wouldn't play. So I removed the top of the case and found that the CD drive can be lifted off. However, I didn't have time to look further.</p>
        <p>After lunch I collected Peter W and we went tot he RCEA talk at Field Place. It was a talk by a member who had worked in the water industry, starting in waste water treatment and then on flood defences. It was interesting. When I got home I helped Angela update her lunch club accounts.</p>
