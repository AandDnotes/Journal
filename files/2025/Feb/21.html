        <h1>Friday 21st February</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going to the butchers, while I started putting together my document describing how to get to each of the IET Sussex talk venues. I had quite a frustrating time trying to get the images to stay where they were put, even though I think I had all the image options set correctly.</p>
        <p>Since Angela was going out later, we had our main meal at lunchtime. After lunch my positioning of images all seemed to work! Perhaps restarting Pages helped. I uploaded the pdf version of the document to our home page. Then I started putting together the RCEA newsletter report of the talk on water engineering. My starting point is to combine Mike W's text with images from the slides. Then I'll adapt them from my own notes.</p>
        <p>Angela went off, in the rain, to the Steyning Centre to play table tennis, getting back in time to have some tea before going out again. This time to the Methodist church to help provide refreshments for a talk by Caroline Lucas (who is trying to sell her book).</p>
