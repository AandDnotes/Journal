        <h1>Thursday 20th February</h1>
        <p>We set off reasonably early to do our weekly groceries shop, going to Lyons Farm. Of course, we came home via Findon Vale garden centre for coffee and a chat.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put some route arrows on images of parts of the Falmer campus in preparation for producing a document showing how to get to each of our Sussex LN talk venues. Then I produced a draft of an email to send to LN chairpersons to find out what events they hold or take part in. I sent the draft to Paul B for review.</p>
        <p>I also started putting together the 'venue' document. Actually I spent most of the time trying to work out how to create a table of contents.</p>
