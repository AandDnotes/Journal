        <h1>Monday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>Angela went out twice today, but I didn't go out at all. Angela went to her Monday club, although the ended up in Phylis's house because the church hall was too cold. Then, after lunch she went to someone's house in Beeding to help make paper flowers for the 'world day of prayer' to be held at St Andrews.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning doing the monthly accounts. Then, while Angela was out again, I exported some videos from iMovie, reduced their size in Handbrake and copied them to the 'backup' MacBook.</p>
