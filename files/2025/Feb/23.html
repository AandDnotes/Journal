        <h1>Sunday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>The day started bright, but soon clouded over. However it stayed dry until about 4 o'clock. Angela went off to church and stayed on for an AGM, getting home just before it started raining.</p>
        <p>I started by sending the draft of the write-up of the RCEA talk on water engineering to Mike W for review. Then I modified my copy of Agatha Christie's 'Dead Man's Folly'. I made each chapter start on a new page and added a table of content.</p>
        <p>Then, whilst it was still dry, I started the TC and took it for a run; twice around my usual figure of eight. It took some starting, but then ran very well. However, I need to look at the brakes.</p>
        <p>Just after Angela got home we spoke with Paul.</p>
