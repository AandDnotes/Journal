        <h1>Friday 7th February</h1>
        <p>A cold day with a biting wind. Angela ventured out to the High Street, but I only got as far as the garage to put tools in my tool bag for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
        <p>I started by preparing and submitting the next Adestra email. I put the date I wanted it to go out in my calendar, so was a bit late submitting it. Then I booked my lunch for the first Wanderers run of the year.</p>
        <p>Apart from running through my 'fusion' slides and doing a little research on adjusting CD players (David Farrer-Brown want me to look at his radio/CD) I only looked up the types of reactors that were involved in the most publicised nuclear accidents.</p>
