        <h1>Wednesday 26th February</h1>
        <p>It started raining just before Angela went off with her walking group. They caught the bus to Shoreham and got very wet. I sat in front of the computer for most of the morning. I replied to the person in Germany who has an air filter assembly, revised the 'start slide' for next Tuesday's talk and sent it to Crawley College. Then I replied to Paul B and started to put together a description of our 'metrics' work so far. I also emailed Peter W to see if he wants a lift to Shoreham on Monday to catch the train for our London walk.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Angela got home from her walk, Felicy came over, since she had locked herself out and John was out. So she sat with us until John got home. Later I emailed the one Local Network that had not replied and did more on the write-up on 'metrics'.</p>
