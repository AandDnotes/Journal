        <h1>Wednesday 5th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking friends during the morning. I found that my video recording of last night's talk was at twice real speed! Luckily the microphone had recorded the speaker and, just about, the questions. Mike sent me the slides, so I superimposed them on the audio.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I finished piecing together video, exported it from iMovie, reduced the file size using Handbrake and uploaded it to the Sussex YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>After dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to watch a film about the re-wilding of the Knepp estate. It was quite interesting.</p>
