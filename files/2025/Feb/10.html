        <h1>Monday 10th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early this morning to help at the lunch club. I dealt with a number of IET Sussex related items. I sent a list of things that I do to Steve W, but he is looking for someone to take on the Chair. I also 'closed' my latest Adestra campaign, added the registration link and re-submitted it. Later, Sam asked which of the two emails (which looked identical) she should approve. I told her (even though I'd added a note to the modified one), but later she rejected it because there was no link to the registration page. However, the link works on my test email, so she must have looked at the closed campaign!</p>
        <p>Before going down to the church for lunch I exported a few more videos. We got home at about 3:30.</p>
        <p>Later I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington.</p>
