        <h1>Thursday 13th February</h1>
        <p>I woke this morning at two minutes to six and turned off the alarm before it went off! So I got up, made breakfast for one and set off at ten past seven for Gatwick. I parked in the short-stay carpark at South Terminal and found my way to the STEM Centre by 8:15, where the FLL was being set up. The children (15 teams worth) arrived at 8:45. I only had three judging sessions, which was quite relaxed.</p>
        <p>Luckily I had been given a parking QR code that meant I didn't have to pay the Â£50 parking fee. I was home just after</p>
        <p>Angela had collected her new reading glasses and had a check-up at the dentist.</p>
