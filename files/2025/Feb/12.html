        <h1>Wednesday 12th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning with her walking group. They took the bus down to Dacre Gardens and then walked back along the river to the Hub for coffee. I set the maturity options for one of Angela's bonds and had correspondence about my Adestra email, which still hadn't been sent out. Eventually I had the opportunity to add the image that Dave P had chosen for the poster and alter the title and it finally went out.</p>
        <p>I also put a little sewing machine oil on the spindle of the CD drive motor (the one that spins the disc), although I couldn't really get at the spindle of the motor that moves the read-head. Anyway, the machine would now play CDs, although it was necessary to press 'play', 'stop' and then 'play' again. So I emailed an update David F-B.</p>
