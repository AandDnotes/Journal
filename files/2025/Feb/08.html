        <h1>Saturday 8th February</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and one that was wet on and off. We started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper, getting some coins (for events where we ned coins) in the process.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was either spent reading the paper or doing the weekly accounts. I also emailed Graeme A about the title and synopsis of his talk next month. He replied later in the day.</p>
        <p>After lunch we both went out, Angela to a 'concert' at the church and me to the Repair Cafe. Angela enjoyed the 'Singers and Strummers' and won a raffle prize. I was a voucher to use at the vinyl record shop in the High Street, so she swapped it with the prize that Shiela had won. The Repair Cafe was quiet (perhaps everyone was at the concert) and I could really only say that I repaired one thing, and then it was some metal parts epoxied together.</p>
        <p>When we got home I popped around the corner to Barbara's and re-attached the towel ring and toilet roll holder to her bathroom walls. They just needed the set-screw tightening with a small allen key. Then we spoke with Victoria. She had finally been able to sort out their driving licences and car insurance, although they are, for the time being at least, paying a lot more than they should. They don't have evidence of how long they've held a driving licence.</p>
