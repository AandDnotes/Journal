        <h1>Sunday 16th February</h1>
        <p>Angela spent most of the morning at church and I looked at more on our trip to Canada. I realised that my cash-flow for the credit card was wrong, since each payment was for the previous month. So I could only buy travel insurance this month. I bought an annual insurance (which was cheaper than the single trip) from AllClear, who had 20% off, and was cheaper than the others that I'd looked at.</p>
        <p>I then tried and failed to increase my credit limit. The decline notice said that I could try again in six months, so I will need to pay the balance for the Rocky Mountaineer using our debit card and wait to buy our flight from Vancouver until next month.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was mainly spent reading the paper until we spoke with Paul.</p>
