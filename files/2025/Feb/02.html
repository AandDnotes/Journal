        <h1>Sunday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I started preparing for Tuesday's IET talk. However, I had problems printing the speaker certificate. Firstly the black ink cartridge needed replacing and then the A5 card simply ran straight through the printer. I eventually found that having a sheet of A4 paper behind the A5 card worked.</p>
        <p>Then I started exporting photos from the Photos app on the iMac, putting them into folders of the same name as the Albums. I finished that after lunch, adding some additional folders in Documents. Then I copied it to old MacBook Air (backup). I then started looking at exporting videos from iMovie.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul.</p>
