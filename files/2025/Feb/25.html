        <h1>Tuesday 25th February</h1>
        <p>The man who said he might have an air filter for a TC found that it was for a TA! However, there is a man in Germany who says he has one. It may be worth the carriage cost.</p>
        <p>After a request from Mike U I created a 'start slide for next Tuesday's talk. The only problem is that we don't have a speaker for April 1st! I also did a little more research and planning for a talk on SMRs.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I attended a CC-UK committee meeting.</p>
