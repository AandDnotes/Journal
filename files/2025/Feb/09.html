        <h1>Sunday 9th February</h1>
        <p>Another grey and mostly wet day. While Angela went to church I sent an old car insurance document to Victoria in case it was of use. Then I reconciled a bank statement against my accounts spreadsheet before updating the IET Sussex 'programme of events' document. Later I uploaded it to the Sussex LN web site and updated Dave Posner's events spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>My attempts to export and backup videos were sightly distracted when I found that a video of our trip to Italy in 2007 had the names of places missing. So I found out how to edit the text and, using the web page for the trip, updated the video before exporting it.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday we had a chat with Paul (and a brief word with Rowan).</p>
