        <h1>Tuesday 8th April</h1>
        <p>We started by walking, in the sunshine, to the High Street to go to the butchers and the Coop.</p>
        <p>The route for tomorrow's Wanderers run has changed due to a closed road, so I reworked the route instructions and printed them. It also seems that EasyJet have changed the plane for our trip next week. So I downloaded the revised boarding passes and printed them. I also looked through my electronic components for use in a new flasher unit, but couldn't find my 555 timer.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting at Field Place. The talk by Ray P was better than I had feared, although it had little to do with engineering. I made some notes and will try to produce a write-up.</p>
        <p>After dinner it was an IET Sussex committee meeting. My only action is to update the web site.</p>
