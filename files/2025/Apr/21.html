        <h1>Monday 21st April</h1>
        <p>Easter Monday and a holiday in the Netherlands. Friday was not a holiday, but Paul took a day off anyway. We had some heavy rain overnight, but today was overcast and just a shower later in the day.</p>
        <p>I spent some time revising my design for 'Austin's RC Lego car' so as to match the voltages. Alfred (the tortoise) was given a bath and then after lunch Rowan also had a bath. We (Paul, Angela and I) took Flo for a walk. Then we played Catan. Krista won and Angela and I did badly.</p>
