        <h1>Friday 11th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street and to the library I checked/modified my notes on Ray Parsons' talk and sent them to Mike W. He said that Ray had told him another story over the phone that he, Mike, will write up and send to me for inclusion. I also produced a start slide and speaker certificate for Tuesday's IET talk and sent the slide to Aijuan. It is a pity that I put the wrong accreditation for the speaker in the Adestra email.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put a coat of paint on the shed. It has been very dry, so I hope that the paint will soak in and not wash off as it has done in the past. Whilst doing this, Angela went off to play table tennis.</p>
        <p>Then I added a 2025 page to my TC outings collection and added details of the Wanderers run on Wednesday. I only made the addition to the DJsMGs Github site and linked to the site from the 'Projects' page. I will later delete the TC4985 repository on the main site. Although this prevents having to maintain two repositories, the downside is that I have to maintain the site through the browser rather than Github Desktop (I think).</p>
