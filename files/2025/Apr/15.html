        <h1>Tuesday 15th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Storrington on the bus to bank some of her Lunch Club cash. I spent some time researching the interface between an Arduino and a Bluetooth transceiver. Then I patched together enough to test two Lego motors. Much of the time was setting up a 9 volt supply. After lunch I used a 'step-down' module to convert 12V to 9V and used a potential divider to vary the speed of the motor. The next step is to use a motor driver.</p>
        <p>Later int eh afternoon I went to Falmer for an IET talk. Mike W had offered to pick me up, but he was an hour out! So I went on my own (as did he). There was quite a long queue on the A27 and then I couldn't find out how to select the car park I was in using the app. The talk was a bit boring and the speaker went on a bit, telling us what we would already know.</p>
