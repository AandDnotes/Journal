        <h1>Monday 7th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday Club I started to look at the alternative TC indicator flashing circuit that Peter Cole had suggested. I spent some time looking at an online tool to draw circuit diagrams, only to find that it was just a seven-day trial.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I collected Angela from the Methodist Church and drove to David and Frans for lunch. It was the last of four in aid of the Turning Tides charity. All the participants today were from the WSMGOC. It was a good, sociable event. We were home by about 3:30. Angela then had a call from Sheila about something she had left in the church. So Angela went down to get it and then spent the rest of the afternoon 'stuck' in Sheila's.</p>
