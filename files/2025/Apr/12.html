        <h1>Saturday 12th April</h1>
        <p>Another sunny and even warmer day. We were up a little later than usual and started by going to the High Street. I then did the weekly accounts while Angela cut the grass, since it might be the last chance before we go away.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was time to go to the Repair Cafe. It was pretty quiet, even though there were only four of us on the electrical bench.</p>
        <p>When I got home we spoke with Victoria. It seems that Brandon had a bad week at work. His view seems to be getting worse rather than better.</p>
