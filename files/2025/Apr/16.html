        <h1>Wednesday 16th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went to Knepp Castle with her walking group. Luckily, after a heavy show just as they were driving off, it stayed dry.</p>
        <p>Since Angela had been complaining about the dripping kitchen tap, I drove to Lyons Farm to buy a pair of new cartridges. I also called into Boots to get some skin cream to take away with us. When I got home I removed the dripping cartridge and fitted the new one. The stop valve under the sink would not turn off completely, so I had to turn off all the water.</p>
        <p>I then looked further at providing power for an RC car and found an eight cell battery holder, which gives 12 volts. But I seem to have managed to destroy both my step-down converters.</p>
        <p>We also packed our clothes, etc. for tomorrow.</p>
