        <h1>Saturday 5th April</h1>
        <p>A fairly usual Saturday, except that it was sunny from dawn to dusk. So we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then I did the weekly accounts. I also put together a document containing details associated with our travel insurance and the information that we would need if we needed their help.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. As usual, she did most of the talking. They have found it much more complicated a move than they had expected and Brandon still thinks that he was miss-sold the job. There is too much work and pressure, for much less pay. Austin and Juniper have decided that they don't want to join the scouts, but seem to be doing reasonably well at school. However, they are still spending too much time on screens.</p>
