        <h1>Sunday 13th April</h1>
        <p>The day was bright, but cloudy, with the occasional sunny spells. It became noticeably cooler as the day went on and the breeze picked up. While Angela went to church I put some primer on the garage step and later gave gave it two coats of stain.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning updating the RCEA April newsletter. I must find a better way of keeping the images with the text, since it took a long time to re-position them. Later I added Mike W's amendments to the notes on Ray P's talk.</p>
        <p>However, I did find time to look for some motors in the 'control technologies' boxes. In addition to some motors that would plug into the control boxes, I found some Lego motors and other Lego kit, including gears. I need to find out if I can connect these motors to an Arduino and battery box.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. Rowan had been to the cinema in Goude with a friend.</p>
