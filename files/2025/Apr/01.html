        <h1>Tuesday 1st April</h1>
        <p>All fools day, but it was a busy one for us. Mid breakfast I took the TC down to Simms for the brake cylinders and flexible hoses to be replaced. I had to be there at 8:30, but they don't know how long it will take them (it doesn't get priority). It didn't seem right leaving the car there!</p>
        <p>Then Angela went to the High Street and the library while I tried to copy my 'ballast resistor' article to the TC's web site. I have to do that via gitHub in the browser rather than through gitHub Desktop. Initially I inadvertently uploaded the folder to the wrong location, but couldn't at first find any way of deleting it. It still didn't seem to work after I reset my privileges to 'write', but later it worked. So I packed up the text and images and sent them to Roger D, with a link to the web page.</p>
        <p>After morning coffee we went to Nymans gardens at Handcross. It was a very sunny day (I wore my sun hat), but the breeze was chilly. Angela took some old children's books to their second hand book shop and then we walked around the main garden. We had intended having lunch there, but it was very busy and the queue in the cafe was very long, so we came home for a latish lunch.</p>
        <p>While Angela cut the grass, I spent some time putting Philip Sherwin's amendments to Mike W's notes on his talk into the report for the RCEA newsletter. I just need to check it before sending him a copy for final review. The final talk of the season is next Tuesday, so I will need to start putting the newsletter together.</p>
