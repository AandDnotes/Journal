        <h1>Tuesday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>A good, but tiring day. We went off fairly early to Den Haag. Paul was supposed to be guiding us around a city walking route, but the 'inner square' was closed for restoration, so we had to take another route which took us away from where we wanted to go. Anyway, we had a long walk and saw some of the main buildings. Also, after lunch, which we ate outside, Rowan and I climbed up an observation tower near the parliament building.</p>
        <p>Later I joined the CC-UK meeting, using Paul's office. Once again we finished the day playing Catan. Krista won yesterday and Paul won today!</p>
