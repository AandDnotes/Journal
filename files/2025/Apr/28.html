        <h1>Monday 28th April</h1>
        <p>I was up a little earlier than usual and drove to Shoreham to join Eurotherm friends to go to London. Angela went to her Monday club.</p>
        <p>It was a gloriously warm and sunny day. We took the Tube to Hammersmith and walked west along the northern shore of the Thames. Our route diverted inland a little and we stopped for lunch at a cafe in the grounds of Chiswick House. Then it was on to Kew Pier. We sailed back to Westminster Pier, sitting on the top deck.</p>
        <p>After a light meal at the usual pub we caught the usual train back. I got home at nine o'clock.</p>
