        <h1>Thursday 17th April</h1>
        <p>A very tiring day. We left home, in the sunshine, and walked to the bus stop, passing a large group who were waiting for a coach to take them to Windsor. At Shoreham High Street we decided to get off the bus and walk to the station. We got there at the same time as the bus! Then found that the train was delayed by five minutes. We got to Gatwick and took the shuttle to the North Terminal, had some of our lunch and caught the flight to Schiphol. We had a long wait at passport control and then< after a cup of tea, took the train to Rotterdam and then the train to Gouda, where Paul met us. It was cloudy in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Greet and Wim called by to drop of Alfred, the tortoise, before they went off for a few days holiday.</p>
