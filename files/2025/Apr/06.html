        <h1>Sunday 6th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went off to church I completed setting things up for our trip to Berkenwoude. I added passport information, checked in to our flights and printed our boarding passes. I also looked up times of trains to/from Gouda from Schiphol. Then I supplied some information about the 'STEM in the Park' event.</p>
        <p>I did a little research into controlling a car (possibly made from Lego) from an iPad before we spoke with Paul. He had just got back from a cycle ride and Rowan was at a friends working on a science project.</p>
