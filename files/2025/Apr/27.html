        <h1>Sunday 27th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I cleared various things, such as reviewed Joanne L's notes from the CC-UK meeting. Then I finished off my web page about our trip to Berkenwoude (and Den Haag) over Easter.</p>
        <p>During lunch we had a quick chat with Paul. It was Greet's birthday, so they were going over for the day.</p>
