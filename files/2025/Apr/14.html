        <h1>Monday 14th April</h1>
        <p>It was not a too early start. Angela was only helping at the lunch club and I didn't need to go early either. So I completed the RCEA April newsletter, including Mike W's note about the Amberley museum, and sent it to Glyn for a final review. We were home by 3:30.</p>
        <p>Later I went to Washington to the WSMGOC meeting. The rain held off, although I took the Panda rather than the TC. I was home just after nine.</p>
