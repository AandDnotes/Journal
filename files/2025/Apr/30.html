        <h1>Wednesday 30th April</h1>
        <p>Another fine, sunny day. Angela went off with her walking group, while I cleared the remaining larger weeds on the drive. Then I 'wiped over' the TC and put on some polish. While doing that, firstly the postman came up to look at the TC and then Kristen's father called. He had a TC when a student.</p>
        <p>Later I spent some time updating one of my TC4985 web page, struggling a bit with using GitHub directly. I also explored setting the browser tab icon. At first it didn't seem to work, but later it was working. I used an existing image, so will now create one specifically for the TC's site.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended the IET Surrey talk by the Engineering Director of Rolls-Royce SMR. It was very good.</p>
