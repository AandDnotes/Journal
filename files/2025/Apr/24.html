        <h1>Thursday 24th April</h1>
        <p>In spite of going to bed very late, we woke quite early (and so have been tired all day). We started by going to Lyons Farm to shop in Lidl and Sainsbury's. We then went on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I set up a cash ISA with Barclays and then booked our flights to Toronto. We chose the early flight (0940) since it was cheaper and arrives around lunchtime. Later, since we need to arrive at Gatwick by 6:30, I investigated staying at a hotel the night before. We may get the train there and back.</p>
