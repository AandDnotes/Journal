        <h1>Friday 25th April</h1>
        <p>The day started by fixing things. Bay's old vacuum cleaner stopped working. It started again after I cleaned the filters. I also made two new 'plugs' to hold the lid on the garden waste bin, since one of my previous wooden plugs had fallen out. I also lubricated the hinges on the bin store.</p>
        <p>Later I booked train tickets and parking for the London walk on Monday. We also discovered that we don't know where we have put our cheque book!</p>
