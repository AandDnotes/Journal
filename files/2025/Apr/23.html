        <h1>Wednesday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>The weather wasn't so good, with heavy rain just before we left. In a way the day was wasted, since we really didn't do anything until Paul took us to Gouda railway station for about five o'clock. In fact we were early and so caught an earlier train into Rotterdam and then an earlier train to Schiphol. It was full.</p>
        <p>Consequently we were quite early, but had already checked in and had no cases to check. We had something to eat and then just sat and waited. The flight was on time and we had a 20 minute wait at Gatwick station (having taken the shuttle from North to South terminals) for the train to Shoreham. We then walked to the High Street, but still had half an hour wait for the last number 2 bus to Steyning.</p>
        <p>By the time we had walked from the bus stop it was 15 minutes past midnight before we got home. We had bought some milk at Gatwick, so after turning on the house we had some chocolate and went to bed.</p>
