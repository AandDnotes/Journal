        <h1>Thursday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual trip to the supermarket to do the weekly grocery shop. It's a pity that I forgot to take our grocery bags! While Angela started in Lidl, I went to B&amp;Q to get a new hinge for the bin store and some lubricating oil (both 3-in-1 and spray). We then went to Boots before going on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went around to Shiela and John's to help move some compost bags. I didn't see her for the rest of the afternoon! Meanwhile, I replaced the broken hinge on the bin store, finished the monthly accounts, printed the route instructions for next week's Wanderers run and started putting together the RCEA April newsletter.</p>
        <p>Although there was a little high cloud this afternoon, it was another sunny day and the forecast is for the fine weather to last beyond the middle of next week. So I might be able to take the TC on the next Wanderers run.</p>
