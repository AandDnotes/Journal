        <h1>Sunday 20th April</h1>
        <p>Easter Sunday and a sunny, hot day (if you were shaded from the wind). After lunch some of Krista's friends from down the road came. Initially it was just the mother, who brought more chocolate (egg, coins, etc.), that we hid around the garden. Then her husband and son came and hunted for the eggs.</p>
        <p>It was a very warm afternoon.</p>
