        <h1>Thursday 10th April</h1>
        <p>A quieter, but still busy day. It was cloudy and chilly in the morning before the sun came out, although it remained chilly. We did our usual weekly groceries shop at Lyons Farm before going on to Findon Vale Garden Centre for coffee. Whilst at Lyons Farm I looked in B&amp;Q at their tap ceramic cartridges, to check the different sizes. I also bought our euros for next week's trip to Berkenwoude.</p>
        <p>I then spent a lot of the afternoon producing a write-up of Tuesday's RCEA talk. I will check it before sending it to Mike W for review.</p>
