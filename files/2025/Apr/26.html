        <h1>Saturday 26th April</h1>
        <p>In some ways it was a normal Saturday. We went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and I went back later in the day to get currents and butter, since I had asked Angela to make some Easter biscuits. I also cleared the worst of the weeds from about one third of the drive.</p>
        <p>Glyn M replied with just four minor corrections to the RCEA April newsletter. So I made the changes, created a pdf version and sent it to Mike W. I also sent Mike extracts from previous RCEA newsletters about the two talks that I'd given them.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. And that is when the not-so-normal part of the day happened. I told her that we had booked our flight to Toronto. She firstly said that they had got the dates mixed up and Gene, Claudia, Holly and her husband were visiting them on our first weekend there! Secondly she said that Brandon was even more upset with his job and had heard from his ex boss that there was a position available for Brandon in Arkansas. Victoria said that Brandon will want to go as soon as possible and the Schools there start back in August. So when we get to Canada there may not be anyone to visit!</p>
