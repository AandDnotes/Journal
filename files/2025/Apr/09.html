        <h1>Wednesday 9th April</h1>
        <p>Although the sun was shining, the breeze was quite cool. This wasn't too much of a problem either for Angela, on her walk, or for me, on my drive. Angela went for a 'short' walk to the Hub with her walking group, whereas I took the TC on the Wanderers run.</p>
        <p>In fact, I drove the TC for 105 miles. I drove to David F-B's in Lyminster and then we took a 'scenic' route to West Dean to meet up with the others. Following a 32 mile run (and then lunch) I took David to Petworth so that he could pick up his TR4 from a garage. Then home. I left home at 9:40 and arrived home at about 3:30. The TC ran very well and a fuel tank dip before and afterwards indicated a fuel consumption of about 25 mpg.</p>
