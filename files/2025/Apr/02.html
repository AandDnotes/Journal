        <h1>Tuesday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>Another sunny and busy day. While Angela went walker with her friends I checked/amended the RCEA talk notes and sent the 'final' version to Philip S. He said that the text was good, but one of the diagrams, that Mike W had adapted, was wrong. So I corrected my version (I'd redrawn it because it did not copy across properly) and updated the report.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I did some work outside. I went out to remove the trellis on the wall in the front garden. But I couldn't move the screws. So I fixed the loose part of the trellis to the wall with another screw. I also removed the remaining nails that were in the top of the garden wall. Then I tried to lubricate the clutch pedal on the Panda, which had been squeaking.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela went to a meeting, I started looking at the monthly accounts. Shortly after starting I received a call from Simms to say that the TC was ready. So I walked down to pick it up. The mechanic (Doug) said that all three flexible hoses were perished, but the rear one was the worst. He also thanked me for removing the tonneau floor and said that he enjoyed working on the car. It seems that it only took him three hours, but at Â£120 per hour plus VAT it was still expensive.</p>
        <p>When I got the car home I replaced the tonneau floor, the contents and the side screens. Then I did a little more to the monthly accounts.</p>
