        <h1>Wednesday 31stDecember</h1>
        <p>New Years Eve. We spent part of the morning trying to find out how the cottage 'works'. Krista had to show us how to make the hob work and, a little later, we failed to get the grill to work.</p>
        <p>After going into the barn for coffee I went back into the cottage until the olie bollen were delivered by Greet. Lunch was then backwards in that we had a sandwich after the cake (olie bolen). We spent the afternoon listening to the rest of them playing online games, which seems an odd thing to do, but was quite interesting.</p>
