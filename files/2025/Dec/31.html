        <h1>Wednesday 31stDecember</h1>
        <p>New Years Eve. We spent part of the morning trying to find out how the cottage 'works'. Krista had to show us how to make the hob work and, a little later, we failed to get the grill to work.</p>
        <p>After going into the barn for coffee I went back into the cottage until the olie bollen were delivered by Greet. Lunch was then backwards in that we had a sandwich after the cake (olie bolen). We spent the afternoon listening to the rest of them playing online games, which seems an odd thing to do, but was quite interesting.</p>
        <p>We could hear fireworks being let off at various times during the day. As night fell, so a few more could be heard and seen in the distance. We all (nine of us) stayed up until midnight, when the children 'jumped' into 2026 and ate 12 grapes (a Spanish custom apparently, to bring you good luck for the new year). Then the fireworks really started. You could see masses of them towards Gouda and others in the far distance, which was Rotterdam. THey were also strung out along the local roads. Quite q few were set off in a field near the cottage and the farm on the corner let some off spradically. We stayed inside, but the others went outside for a while. It seems that the Dutch are 'insane' about fireworks. They went on continuously past two o'clock and a few were still being let off after four am.</p>
        <p>Krista stayed out with the ponies and we tried to keep Flo calm. However, she wet her cushion and Paul had to put it outside and mop the floor. We eventually went to bed at 2:30, with the din still going on. Welcome to 2026!</p>
