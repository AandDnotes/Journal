        <h1>Wednesday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>I thought that I only had one thing to do today, but it turned out to be otherwise. Angela went off walking with her friends, actually only one but four others joined them for coffee at the Hub. I did my one thing, to send a reminder to the PEI Group members about our meeting next week. However, I then decided to register for next week's IET talk, only to find that there was no 'register' button on the web page! Luckily, a quick email to our Network Manager got that put right. But, even with me, there were only four people registerd. It seems that the IET regional events email will go out on Friday.</p>
        <p>I also emailed Glyn M to see if he had received the RCEA newsletter for proof reading, but I've still had no reply. Then I emailed the person from the UoS who is suposed to be giving an IET talk in February, asking for his talk title and synopsis.</p>
        <p>After that I just had time before lunch to go into the garage and look for a gearbox oil dipstick, but failed to find one. Later I discovered that the all-synchro four speed box only has a filler/level hole on the side, which can only be reached from under the car!</p>
        <p>Later I updated the B's web pages, bringing my local copy into synch with the github version and adding an 'Articles' page with a link to my one (so far) article for Main Gear.</p>
        <p>All in all, quite a busy day.</p>
