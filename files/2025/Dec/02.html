        <h1>Tuesday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>It was a day of clearing things on my to-do list, which started in sunshine and later became very wet. I went to the High Street to get my hair cut and Angela went to the butchers.</p>
        <p>I created a blog post in an attempt to publicise the next IET talk. The last time I tried to do this my blog was not approved. So I will wait to see what happens this time. I also sent details of the talk to Mark C to put on the IET social media channels and did the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>I emailed the chairs of each of my CC-UK Local Networks about their budgets for next year. Later in the day I attended the CC-UK meeting. We didn't actually do anything since Joanne L is taking early retirement and will leave the IET at the end of the month.</p>
