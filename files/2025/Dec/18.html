        <h1>Thursday 18th December</h1>
        <p>It didn't stop raining all day and there was a lot of standing water on the roads. We started by going to Halfords in Shoreham to buy two small torches, but they only had one. We then went on to Lidl to do the food shop until we go off to Paul's. Then we popped into Dunelm for coffee and to buy some batteries, some for the small torch in the Panda.</p>
        <p>From there we went to Findon Valley (in the rain) to go to the locksmiths. They had a suitable blank for the B's ignition key and soon cut a new one. They were half the price quoted by Timpson. They also had the small torches, so I bought the second one.</p>
        <p>Later I created the 'Outings' page of my MGB web site.</p>
