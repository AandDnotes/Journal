        <h1>Friday 5th December</h1>
        <p>I spent an hour this morning and then another hour this afternoon in the garaage, firstly putting RainX on the windscreen of the B and then putting Double Speed-wax on the paintwork. I couldn't find any plate with a body number, so I messaged British Motor Heritage, who make body shells, asking if there was sny way that I could find out when the body was made and for whom.</p>
        <p>While Angela walked to the High Street and library, mainly missing the rain, I updated two of my MGB web pages.</p>
        <p>The MGB handbook that I'd ordered still hasn't arrived after seven days, so I told the supplyer, who is going to send me another one.</p>
