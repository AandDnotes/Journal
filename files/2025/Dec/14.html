        <h1>Sunday 14th December</h1>
        <p>Rather than go to church in the morning, Angela went to a carol service in the afternoon. So after she walked to the Post Office to post some Christmas cards we spoke with Paul. They were planning to go to the pancake house later, with Wim and Greet and Krista's brother and family.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I glued together the two sides of my bookmarks, using pins to align them, which was more difficult than I thought. I left it under weights to dry.</p>
        <p>I also put together the IET talk video and moved our Canadian dollars to Euros.</p>
