        <h1>Wednesday 24th December</h1>
        <p>A sunny day with clear blue sky and a nice red sunrise. However, it was very cold, with a keen easterly wind.</p>
        <p>After breakfast we started by finishing the jigsaw puzzle. Then there was a lot of activity, baking cakes (gluten free from packets), building a Cool Blue model (Lego like) of a cafe in Rotterdam and making Christmas tree decoration. I left the others to do these things while I modified my slide set on process automation and ran through them.</p>
        <p>After lunch Rowan collected greenery from the garden and made two table decorations (with candles) while Paul and I started looking at installing their new outside lights. It was very cold out there and we found that that the conduit for the wires protruded, so we had to make wooden blocks to go over them. Paul painted them the same as the wall boards and left them to dry in the workshop.</p>
        <p>For a while befor and then after dinner we watched the latest 'Knives Out' film.</p>
