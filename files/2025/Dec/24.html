        <h1>Wednesday 24th December</h1>
        <p>A sunny day with clear blue sky and a nice red sunrise. However, it was very cold, with a keen easterly wind.</p>
        <p>After breakfast we started by finishing the jigsaw puzzle. Then there was a lot of activity, baking cakes (gluten free from packets), building a Cool Blue model (Lego like) of a cafe in Rotterdam and making Christmas tree decoration. I left the others to do these things while I modified my slide set on process automation and ran through them.</p>
