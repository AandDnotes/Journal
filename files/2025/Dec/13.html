        <h1>Saturday 13th December</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and one that was sunny from dawn to dusk. We started by walking to the High Street. We started by buying a newspaper and some apples. Then Angela went off to the Post Office to get some more stamps while I called into the opticians. I've found that my left eye is clear, but my right eye is slightly cloudy. So I made an appointment to see the optician next week. I then went on to the Post Office to see if they could cut a new key for the B. However, they don't cut car keys, but gave me the name and number of a locksmith in Findon.</p>
        <p>We then went off, in the B, to Slindon to join a SADCASE meeting at the Spur. I talked to the owner of a 1972 B GT, who had just had the nearside sill replaced. He said that his gearbox has a dipstick, so mine probably does too. We went inside for a coffee and met Doug, who is the mechanic at Simms who deals with older cars. He came out to look at the car and suggested that I take the B down to Simms one day at about 3:30 to see if I can put it on a lift to have a look underneath. It seems that the owner, who would charge for it, is only there in the mornings.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleaned out the gutters, since at least one had overflowed.</p>
