        <h1>Monday 15th December</h1>
        <p>Peter W picked me up just after nine to go to Shoreham to catch the train to Victoria, joining the other 'London walkers'. We walked to Westminster pier and took the Uber boat to Greenwhich. We then went to the Queens House before having lunch and then going around the Maritime Museaum. Finally we walked under the Thames, took the DLR and tube to Wesminster and walked to the pub for dinner, before walking to Victoria to catch the train back to Shoreham. I got home at nine o'clock.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went to her Monday Club.</p>
