        <h1>Monday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>Quite a long and tiring day. We started by catching the bus to Shoreham station. A lot of people getting on were trying to pay using their phone; and failing. so we arrived a bit late. The level crossing was closed when we arrived and our train was in the station before we put our tickets in the barrier, on the wrong side of the station!. We hurriedly went through the tunnel under the tracks and just got through the first door, right at the back of the train. We changed to the Thamelink train at Burgess Hill, which took us to St Pancras.</p>
        <p>We were quite early, so had coffee, looked around, bought some lunch and sat for a while before queing for the Eurostar train. Then it was through security and passport control. That train took us all the way to Rotterdam, from where we caught the train to Gouda, where Paul met us. It was noticably colder than when we left home and it was about half past eight by the time that we got to the barn.</p>
