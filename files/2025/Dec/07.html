        <h1>Sunday 7th December</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up and didn't stop until about 2:30pm. Angela got wet going to and from church and I drove the B to Bognor MG. It was a good chance to talk to some club members about different aspects of the B. I'm not sure there was anyone other than club members at the event!</p>
        <p>I had already updated my local copy of the TC history page, so I uploaded it to github and then emailed Patrick.</p>
