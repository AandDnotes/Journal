        <h1>Saturday 26th December</h1>
        <p>I had a bad night. If I laid on my side I could sleep, but my nose ran. If is smi-sat then my nose didn't run, but I couldn't sleep. I think I only had about two hours sleep, even though we were faily late up.</p>
        <p>So I sat for most of the morning while the others worked on the jigsaw. However, after lunch I went outside with Paul to fit the new lights.</p>
