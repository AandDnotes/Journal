        <h1>Friday 12th December</h1>
        <p>After a shower we went off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. Actually we didn't have a very long list and had a much smaller basket than most people. After Lidle, where we got all the food we wanted, we went over to Timpsons to see if I could get a new key cut for the B. He didn't have a suitable blank, which he would need to order. It would take 4-5 days and would cost £30! So I said I would leave it until the new year. We went on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I completed my set of Christmas emails and sent them. Angela also completed some cards with letters and walked down to the Post Office to post them.</p>
