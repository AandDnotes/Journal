        <h1>Tuesday 30th December</h1>
        <p>A bright, but very frosty day. It didn't start too well in that I had an email from Eurostar saying that there were power problems in the Channel Tunnel and that trains would be cancelled or delayed! Our train was still scheduled, but we had the option to cancel or postpone our trip.</p>
