        <h1>Tuesday 30th December</h1>
        <p>A bright, but very frosty day. It didn't start too well in that I had an email from Eurostar saying that there were power problems in the Channel Tunnel and that trains would be cancelled or delayed! Our train was still scheduled, but we had the option to cancel or postpone our trip.</p>
        <p>So we proceeded as normal. Paul took us to Gouda for one o'clock, we topped-up our UV-Chip cards and caught the train into Rotterdam. WE bought some lunch to have later, but to our surprise the Eurostar UK passport building was closed, although we could see staff inside. After the Eurostar to Paris had departed and the next train on that platform (to Breda) came onto the screens, it said that the next train, the Eurostar to London, was cancelled. Neither we nor anther British couple had received any email about it, so I knocked on the UK passprt control door and they said that they had no idea when trains would be running!</p>
        <p>We found a train about to leave for Gouda and got on it, calling Paul to ask him to pick us up. I seems that not only was there a power problem, but a Le Shuttle train was stuck. There were no Standard fare spaces on any trains to Londonthat we could find, so we booked 'Plus' tickets (paying an upgrade) for Monday. So we are here for the New Year!</p>
        <p>We moved our things into the cottage and Martin, Sharon and their two children arrived just after six.</p>
