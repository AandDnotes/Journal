        <h1>Tuesday 9th December</h1>
        <p>A grey, warm, but mainly dry day. Angela walked to the High Street while I initially tried to change the lightbulb in the study. It has started flickering last night. However, firstly the glass part of the bulb came away. Then while trying to remove the metal part, the bulb holder disintegrated! Luckily I had a new fitting in the garage, although it took a little while to wire it in. Then I downloaded the attendance list for this evening's talk and emailed the Dutch T-Type and Pre-war car club about linking them with my TC4985 web site.</p>
        <p>I had my main meal, turkey salad, while Angela went to the church. I then picked up Peter W and went to Field Place for the RCEA talk. A short while after I got home I left for Worthing College and the IET talk. Unfortunately it was very poorly attended.</p>
