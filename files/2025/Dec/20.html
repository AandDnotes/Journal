        <h1>Saturday 20th December</h1>
        <p>We had cancelled our milk delivery for the days over Christmas that we are away. But that left us a bit short this morning, so Angela went down to the High Street before breakfast to by milk and a newspaper. Lickily it was a dry and calm day.</p>
        <p>Later I did the weekly accounts and replied to a few email. Then I spent some time working out who owned the B and when. It took a while to verify the bought/sold dates, but it all seems to hang together.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria. Their builder started work today (demolition), so they when to material and appliance suppliers to look at options.</p>
