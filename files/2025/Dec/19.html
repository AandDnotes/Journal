        <h1>Friday 19th December</h1>
        <p>The morning started, perhaps a little late, by me going to the optician in the High Street. Luckily it was a calm, sunny day. I had noticed that the vision of my right eye was cloudy, compared to a very 'sharp' left eye. The optician will refer me to Spa Medica to have the rear surface of the new lens in my right eye laser treated to remove a coating that is forming. It might be six to eight weeks before I get an appointment.</p>
        <p>Later I sent Dave P the title and synopsis. Then I looked at the slide set that I'd created many years ago to give an overview of process automation. I tried changing the style of the slides, but all the sizes of images and drawings changed. So I went back to the 'book' style. A bit fussy, bit it will have to do. I also added a slide to show examples of the data provided by the client and added annimated gifs to illustrate PID tuning.</p>
