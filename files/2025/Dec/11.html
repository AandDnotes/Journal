        <h1>Thursday 11th December</h1>
        <p>Today was all about the RCEA Christmas Lunch at Findon Manor. We worked on our Christmas letters before we went out, I reduced the video files from Tuesday's talk and sent a couple of emails. There were a few people already at Findon Manor when we arrived, although the rest came in shortly after us.</p>
        <p>The meal was good, without being excellent. There was plenty of it, although the potatoes and sproutes were not cooked as well as those served at the Lunch Club. However, we did have a starter; Angela had a prawn cocktail and I had onion soup. The Christmas pudding was a little odd around the outside, but okay.</p>
        <p>When we got home I sent Victoria a birthday email and transferred £100 into her Halifax account. I also taxed the B. It seemed that road tax is not transferable, so the car has been un-taxed since the beginning of November. Anyway, it is now taxed, at zero cost. Also, my MGB Handbook and the replacement for the one that didn't arrive, were both in the mail box when we got home.</p>
