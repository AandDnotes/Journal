        <h1>Saturday 6th December</h1>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent cooking and then slicing the rooled turkey breast for the Lnch Club. Actually it was only just over an hour in the morning and another hour in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. Gene was with them to fix some shelves to the wall in Juniper's bedroom.</p>
        <p>I added the comments that Glyn M made on the RCEA December Newsletter and sent it to Mike W. I also updated the 'one-page' events list that Mike U wanted and sent it to him.</p>
