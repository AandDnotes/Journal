        <h1>Monday 8th December</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier than usual and Angela was down at the church  kitchen for nine o'clock to help Pauline, the cook for the Lunch Club Christmas lunch. I knocked a few things off my to-do list, mainly in connection with tomorrow's IET talk. Luckily my speaker for February sent his talk title and synopsis and I managed to cover the B with two thin dustsheets. I also tried deleting my gmail account and adding it back in. However, it didn't stop Mail from trying to download hundreds of messages! Then I joined Angela just after midday.</p>
        <p>They had put together a good meal and there were about 35 people, so it was a good event. However, Angela was very tired by the time we got home around 3:30.</p>
        <p>I made a small start on my Christmas letters by listing the major events of the year and experimenting with images in an email. This year I've decided to send out emails rather than letters.</p>
