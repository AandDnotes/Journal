        <h1>Monday 1st December</h1>
        <p>The countdown to Christmas has started. It's only three weeks until we go to the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>It seemed to rain for most of the day ande was quite windy. Angela went off to her Monday club as usual, but I stayed indoors all day, mainly in the study. I finished the RCEA December newsletter and sent a pdf version off to Glyn M for proof reading. It took me some time to re-position images that had moved.</p>
        <p>I had already prepared the 'fan boat' video and the photo of Lewis STEM Fair, so I added a STEM section to the IET Sussex web page, including both the video and the photo. I also modified my 'Important' site for the change of MG club.</p>
        <p>Another thing on my to-do list was to buy train tickets for the next London walk, even though it will mainly be inside. I also ordered some 'Double Speeed-wax' for the MG and booked a slot to have my hair cut tomorrow.</p>
