        <h1>Tuesday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>Another cold day. I didn't sleep well, in spite of being tired after travelling yesterday.</p>
        <p>During the morning I put together a web page for small jobs on the MGB, but couldn't uploadi it because the local copy of the B's web site is on the iMac.</p>
        <p>After lunch Paul drove us to the garden centre that we went to a few years ago; the one that is full of Christmas decorations. Krista wanted to buy some oasis and Paul wanted to look for some new outside lights. Of course, they bought a few other things as well and it was very cold.</p>
        <p>Then we started a jigsaw puzzle; quite a small one of a winter scene painting.</p>
