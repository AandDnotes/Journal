        <h1>Friday 26th December</h1>
        <p>Boxing Day and another sunny, reasonably calm, but very cold day. All the sloten had a thin layer of ice over them.</p>
        <p>Paul got out another jigsaw, which he, Krista and Angela worked at. I'd developed a sore throught over Christmas Day and spent most of the morning simply sitting. However, after lunch Paul (with Flo), Rowan, Angela and I went for a walk. Later we had dinner of pieces of meat and prawns cooked on an electrically heated stone in the middle of the table. It took awhile for the pieces to cook, but was otherwise interesting. Then we watched another Christmas film (A Christmas Chronicle).</p>
