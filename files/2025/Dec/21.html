        <h1>Sunday 21st December</h1>
        <p>The winter solstice. So it is on the way up from here. It was dry(ish) today, although it rained later.</p>
        <p>While Angela was at church I generated an MGB themed Christmas card and sent it to Patrick and Piera. I used Copilot to modify my photo of the MGB to remove the background and keet the shadow underneath. Then I put it on top of a snowy scene.</p>
        <p>I then spent some time during the day putting my MGB owners into a history page. Later I uploaded it to github.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. Later we briefly spoke to Paul. During the day we put out the things we need to pack.</p>
