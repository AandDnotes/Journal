        <h1>Thursday 4th December</h1>
        <p>Today was all about doing our weekly shop and getting a few things for the Lunch Club Christmas lunch. But Angela also needed to get some hearing aid bit from the shop in Worthing, so we went to Lidl and then over to Waitrose. We only went there for coffee, but ended up spending over £40!</p>
        <p>We then walked to the bank to get some cash, to the hearing aid shop and then on to the library to get some Christmas cards. Then it was off to Sainsbury's to get the few remaining items. We just got home in time to have lunch.</p>
        <p>While we were in the library I got a text from the strimmer man and I replied after we got home. He said that his phone had been on silent and hadn't checked voicemail. So he came around later to collect it.</p>
        <p>While Angela walked to the Post Office to post Victoria's birthday card, I went into the garage to 'wipe down' the B. Tomorrow I will put some RainX on the windscreen and put some Double Speed-Wax on the bodywork.</p>
