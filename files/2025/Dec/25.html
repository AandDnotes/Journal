        <h1>Thudsday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Day, and a very sunny one. However, it was also very cold, with a biting wind, or so we were told. Luckily Angela and I didn't need to go out of the house.</p>
        <p>We opened presents and then helped peel vegetables before lunch. Greet and Wim came for a while. We all had a good turkey and pork lunch and then they left.</p>
        <p>Later we played a game and then watched a film (The Holiday).</p>
