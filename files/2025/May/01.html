        <h1>Thursday 1st May</h1>
        <p>May Day and the hottest on record. We started by going to Lidl in Shoreham to do the weekly groceries shop and then went on to Dunelm to buy some hand towels (and to have coffee).</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the health centre to have our Covid booster jab. We then bought a few items that we couldn't get at Lidl. I then created a start slide for next week's IET talk and sent it to Crawley College. I also experimented with putting a .ico on the home page of my TC4985 web site. However, it seems that I need to add it to every page!</p>
