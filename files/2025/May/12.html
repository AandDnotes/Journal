        <h1>Monday 12th May</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Angela went off early to help set up for the lunch club. I uploaded the video of last week's IET talk to YouTube and then set up a new ISA for Angela, using this year's allowance. Later I set up a two-year bond. Both were funded from a bond of mine that had matured.</p>
        <p>I had seconds of the steak and kidney pie and seconds of the rice pudding at the lunch club, so I was very full. About a dozen people had canceled this morning or just didn't turn up, so there was plenty of food.</p>
        <p>Later I went to Washington for the WSMGOC monthly meeting. During the evening they had a 'choose the car that you would like to take home' competition and out TC came top. I won a bottle of proseco. On the way home, still in the light, the engine was stuttering when I tried to accelerate!</p>
