        <h1>Saturday 10th May</h1>
        <p>It was a sunny and, eventually, hot day. After our walk to the High Street I spent the morning doing the weekly accounts. For some reason there had been a corruption of the figures for May. After correcting that and checking entries against the bank statement I was Â£22.50 out!</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. The four of us on the electrical bench were busy all the time. I brought home a toaster, since it came in just before we finished.</p>
        <p>After dinner we had a long chat with Victoria.</p>
