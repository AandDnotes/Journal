        <h1>Tuesday 13th May</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day from dawn to dusk. I had decided to get new spark plugs for the TC, so went off to Halfords in Shoreham. However, they only had a few for modern cars and suggested that I went to their motor factor. So I went to Broadwater, but found another motor factor nearby and was able to get the right spark plugs. So I fitted them and checked the points. Then I took the TC for a test drive and it ran well. So, fingers crossed for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I played with flavicons for a while and then produced an Adestra email for our last IET talk of the season.</p>
