        <h1>Wednesday 28th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking (and drinking coffee at the Hub) with her friends. I spent a lot of the day working on Peter Cole's version of an indicator flasher design. It took a while to find the components that I could use to test the design. Initially I built a circuit to just flash an LED and then extended it to include the large capacitor, that keeps the 555 timer operating when the indicator is off, and the MOSFET that switches the bulb. It worked, so I made a short video and sent it to Peter.</p>
        <p>I also signed up for the Brighton and Hove Classic Motor Show in the middle of June.</p>
