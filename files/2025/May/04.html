        <h1>Sunday 4th May</h1>
        <p>Quite a tiring day, considering that I mainly walked around along the High Street, stood by or sat in the TC. I also walked to the church a couple of times for coffee and cake. On the other hand, Angela served teas, coffees, cake and cream teas and did a lot of washing up. It was the Steyning Vintage Revival and, although a little chilly, was mainly bright and sometimes sunny. There were a lot of people, quite a few cars, two steam traction engines and a few fairground rides.</p>
        <p>I left just after four o'clock, but Angela didn't get home until nearer six. We then put the dinner on before speaking with Paul. Rowan had been busy during the second week of her holiday having a 'sleep-over' with one friend and having another around for the day.</p>
