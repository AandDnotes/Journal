        <h1>Wednesday 21st May</h1>
        <p>Angela was very active and busy today, whereas I mostly sat. Angela started by going walking with her friends, while I recovered video and audio files from the camera, my phone and the microphone. I started putting them together in iMovie and cut up the two audio files in 'Garage Band' before moving the clips into iMovie and trimming them to fit.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis, which was using the small hall this week. I spent some time aligning the available video with the audio track and then produced the video and uploaded it to the IET Sussex YouTube channel. I also searched for a better image of a quill pen for my favicon.</p>
