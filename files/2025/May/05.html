        <h1>Monday 5th May</h1>
        <p>A Bank Holiday and the first day of celebration for the 80th anniversary of VE Day, but we had nothing organised, apart from Angela going down to the church before lunch to help do something or other. I completed the monthly accounts and prepared things for tomorrow's IET talk.</p>
        <p>I spent a little time looking further at 'icons' within the browser.</p>
