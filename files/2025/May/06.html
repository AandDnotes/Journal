        <h1>Tuesday 6th May</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. I had an appointment at Brighton hospital just after lunch, so we took the bus to Brighton in the morning. Angela bought some shoes and I bought a light-weight flees in a sale. Angela also paid in a cheque. We then walked to the hospital and had some lunch in their cafe before my appointment. I saw the same doctor that I'd seen at Southlands, who just reviewed my test results. It seems that my foliate level is a little low so I had another blood sample taken so that it can be checked.</p>
        <p>After returning home I drove to Crawley for an IET talk. I videoed the talk, but both batteries ran down and so I had to finish the recording on my phone. The speaker allowed questions during the talk, so debates started and the whole thing went on longer than usual.</p>
