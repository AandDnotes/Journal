        <h1>Saturday 31st May</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Angela also bought some strawberries, since we have some cream. We usually have them with a meringue nest. This probably vastly increases the amount of sugar that we eat, but they do go well together (and with some cream). The other down side is that we end up with too much milk, since I'm not making custard.</p>
        <p>It was sunny and warm, so we had both morning coffee and afternoon tea in the garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Brandon was just packing to go off to Kansas City and then on to Arkansas for his interview with Eighty Acres.</p>
        <p>My Bluetooth module arrived, so I had a little play with it. The iPhone app that is available from the manufacturer connects to the device, but I couldn't get it to receive a reply to a request. The user guide is written in Chinese English and so not easy to follow. More investigation is needed.</p>
