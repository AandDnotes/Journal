        <h1>Thursday 29th May</h1>
        <p>The usual groceries shop at Lidl and Sainsbury's was followed by coffee and plant buying at Findon Vale.</p>
        <p>After lunch I connected the Bluetooth module to the Arduino and tried to connect to it from my phone. But it wouldn't connect. I then discovered that the HC-10 module does not have BLE Bluetooth and so Apple doesn't support it! So I ordered an HM-10 module, which should work. I bought a more expensive one, which comes with an app that can be used to configure the module, just in case I need to generate a code. I also ordered a 0.5m USB-c/USB-c cable. Since I only have one.</p>
