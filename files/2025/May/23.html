        <h1>Friday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>A piece of one of Angela's teeth had broken off yesterday, so she had made an appointment to go to the dentist this morning. Although the dentist thought she should have a crown fitted, she decided to just have it filled. Since she couldn't eat on it for an hour she  went out again to the library and a grocers in the High Street.</p>
        <p>I continued searching for components for my motor control project (with Austin), taking a lot of the day to find them and order them. I had to go to three different suppliers, spending, for two of them, more on delivery charges than on the parts. I also made a few notes on different, emerging techniques for AI, in case I need to produce another talk.</p>
        <p>On Monday next door started having their garage converted into living space. Today there was a lot of noise from a nail gun as the new roof was constructed. Later I 'brushed' off the broad-leafed weeds on the drive.</p>
