        <h1>Thursday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>We started with quite a mammoth shop. We started our usual grocery shop at Lidl in Shoreham, then went to Dunelm for coffee and to get some bottom weights for the vertical blind in the study and a 'pot' for the 'half sink' in the kitchen. We then went on to The Range, to B&Q and to Sainsbury's.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela worked int he garden and I started looking at components that I need for a revised flashing indicator circuit and for Lego motor control.</p>
