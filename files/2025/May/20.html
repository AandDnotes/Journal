        <h1>Tuesday 20th May</h1>
        <p>Quite early on (before I showered) John L called and asked if he and his wife could call before lunch to view the TC. They arrived just before eleven. After coffee, Christine sat with Angela and I took John for a short run in the TC. He was complementary, but wants to look at a TD and a TC that friends of his want to sell. However, both are black, and he doesn't like black. So I now wait to hear from him.</p>
        <p>After lunch I printed off the attendance list for the evening talk and finished charging the camera's battery. Then I went to Falmer. The talk wasn't very well supported and the battery ran out during the questions, which must have corrupted the last file, since the camera then said that the SD card was full. I recorded the final part on my phone.</p>
