        <h1>Sunday 25th May</h1>
        <p>This morning I took the TC to Camelia Botna for a SADCASE meeting. It started drizzling as I left, but it didn't last long and it turned into a bright, warm day. There were about 100 cars there! I got home at around midday. Meanwhile, Angela ent to church.</p>
        <p>After lunch we visited some of the Steyning Arts Trail venues before talking with Paul.</p>
