        <h1>Monday 26th May</h1>
        <p>Today was the Spring Bank Holiday and the Steyning Fair. We walked down to the High Street at about 11:30, starting by going to Fletchers Croft (where there was a dog show) before taking my repeat prescription to the health centre. We then walked from Tanyard Lane back up the High Street. There were people everywhere and, luckily, the sun came out, even though it stayed breezy. We got home just in time for lunch, having met quite a few people that we knew.</p>
        <p>Before we went out I modified the flavicon files and statements in my main web page, the Projects page and the 'How to' page. I'd realised that they all had the same names and so Safari only cached the first used. However, two of the updates failed to deploy. As usual I tried to run the actions again, but they just stuck in the queue. Later, one seemed to have run, but the apple-touch-icons still did not work properly.</p>
        <p>I spent some time putting together a circuit diagram for a revised TC flasher unit, following the suggestion made by Peter Cole.</p>
