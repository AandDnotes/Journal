        <h1>Saturday 24th May</h1>
        <p>Angela left early to help set up a Christian Aid coffee morning at the Methodist Church, while I went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and did the weekly accounts. While I was out the Arduino and bluetooth module that I'd ordered arrived. Then I walked down to the church for coffee and cake. It was well attended.</p>
        <p>We had lunch a little later than usual, but then spoke with Victoria. Later I found a way to provide an estimate of our savings interest in the 'investments' spreadsheet, that will cope with rows being added.</p>
