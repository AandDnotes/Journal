        <h1>Friday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>It looks as though the dry weather is going to continue for the next fortnight. So I emailed Ursula to say that I would join the Sussex Wanderers later in the month. Then I took the TC for a run. However, when I turned on the ignition the fuel pump did not click! I hit the pump a few times with the car-wash brush and it started. So I drove my usual route, up through Ashurst to Partridge Green and then down to Henfield and Small Dole, 17 miles. The car ran well.</p>
        <p>Later I 'played' some more with 'flavicons', getting my TC icon to appear on both the browser tab and the favourites page. The problem is that it only works for that page and not for any others on the site. So the html tags need to be added to every page!</p>
