        <h1>Saturday 17th May</h1>
        <p>The alarm woke me this morning at 6:30 and I was at Mike W's at 8:20. He then drove to the Memorial Gardens in Crawley to set up for the STEM in the Park day. Ian M arrived at 9:30 with the kits and literature. Rahaf and Tom arrived a little later and we were ready for the start at eleven.</p>
        <p>The day started overcast and a bit chilly, but the sun came out before lunch and it became warm. At least with five of us we were able to take a break and look around the other stands. We started packing up four and I was home just after 5:30. Exhausted!</p>
