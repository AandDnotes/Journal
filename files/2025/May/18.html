        <h1>Sunday 18th May</h1>
        <p>A quieter day than yesterday and a day for catching up. I spent a lot of the morning doing the weekly accounts and updating them due to the various renewed investments that we have made recently.</p>
        <p>I failed to move the small bolts that were holding together the Kenwood toaster. So I phoned the owner and he called to collect it.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul.</p>
