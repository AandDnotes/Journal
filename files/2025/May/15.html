        <h1>Thursday 15th May</h1>
        <p>A distinct lack of sunshine today and the breeze was quite cool. We went off to Lyons Farm to buy some compost and do our weekly grocery shop. We then went into Worthing to get a few things in Waitrose that we couldn't get in Lidl (plus coffee) and went to B&amp;M to get a mat to put by the patio door and some printer paper.</p>
        <p>The only problem was the traffic. Road works on the A27 west of Lyons Farm cause a long queue approaching the lights and getting out.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage and removed the slow running cable. A small disk in the adjusting knob had pulled over the flattened end of the cable. I silver soldered it to the end of the cable, then replaced it. It now seems to work, but I will need to take it for a run. I also found that the medallion on top of the off-side side lamp had come off! It must have popped out on one of the bumpy roads yesterday. It looks as though I can get one from Brown &amp; Gammon.</p>
