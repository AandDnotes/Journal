        <h1>Friday 16th May</h1>
        <p>A quieter day, but still sunny and warm. Angela walked to the butchers and other places in her new shoes, getting blisters in the process. I ordered the medallion on the top of the TC's side light, along with two new screws for those lights. I also found a good image of the front of a TC and produced an image to use as a flavicon.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I took the TC for a shorter than usual test run to see if I had adjusted the slow running cable properly. All was fine. I also collected together the things that I need to take to Crawley tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Later still I looked at taking the Repair Cafe toaster apart. However, it is held together with some unusual small set screws. I WhatsApp'd the Electro/Mech team to see if anyone has a suitable tool. No answer yet.</p>
