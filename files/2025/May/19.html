        <h1>Monday 19th May</h1>
        <p>We had a fairly early start at Tom's. The idea was to get various Lunch Club cooks together to do their online 'Cooking Safety Coarse'. So five people logged into Tom's wi-fi, but only Tom and Angela had (or could find) the email giving them a link and password. However, when Angela tried to log in it just refused access. So Tom worked through the course, getting each step spoken by the system. He then did the exam at the end, but managed to skip over about three questions. This meant that he did not pass and will need to do the exam again. The 'site' was asked to send people another email with links/passwords. This took us from 9:30 to nearly midday. Angela tried to log in again when we got home, but still couldn't get access.</p>
        <p>Later Angela went to the High Street while I created a speaker certificate for tomorrow's IET talk and downloaded the attendance list. I also 'played' with my attempts to get favicons to work. I modified a TC image to make it look more like TC4985 and used a site to create a set of images. The site also gave the lines of html to add to the &lt;head&gt; element. However, although the image fills the apple-touch-icon, the picture is small. Also the favicon on the tab does not have rounded corners.</p>
