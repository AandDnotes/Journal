        <h1>Saturday 3rd May</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, but for me at least, quite a lot of sitting around. We walked down to the church just before 9:30, carrying the cakes and desert that Angela had mede. It was the Craft Fair. I went on to buy a newspaper and then went back to the church. So Angela spent until two o'clock making ploughman's lunches and I sold lunch tickets. For the first time we had a device for using debit/credit cards. After having our own lunch (just after two) I cam home and did the weekly accounts, while Angela helped clearing up.</p>
        <p>It was cool, but pleasant when we went down and I was glad of my sweater, but it had warmed up by the time I came home.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Victoria. Brandon has applied for the job in Arkansas and is likely to be called for interview in June. However, he seems to see a potential future where he is.</p>
