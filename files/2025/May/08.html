        <h1>Thursday 8th May</h1>
        <p>It was Rowan's 13th birthday today, so we sent her an email and then later in the day spoke to her. Then, being Thursday, we went off to Lyons Farm to do our weekly grocery shop, mainly at Lidl and the rest at Sainsbury's. However, we started by taking old flower pots to B&amp;Q and then went into Currys to buy a Roku device to replace our old ChromeCast. Later in the day I installed it. We then went to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>I also spent quite a lot of time trying to work out how to get the Wanderers GPX file into Google Maps and get voice directions. Progress, but not done.</p>
