        <h1>Wednesday 7th May</h1>
        <p>Quite a frustrating day. We have not been able to connect the Channel 4 app on the iPad to the Chromecast, so I had emailed Channel 4. They replied quickly, but said that our Chromecast is no longer supported by Google and has been dropped by Channel 4. Other streaming services are likely to follow.</p>
        <p>I spent some time getting the microphone app to download the audio file and also found that the video file that ended when the second battery failed was corrupted. I managed to use a free online application to restore it, but, although the sound is complete, the second half of the video is blank!</p>
        <p>The only good thing that happened was that we went to the Steyning film night to see the Bob Dylan biopic. It was quite long and the Dylan character mumbled a lot, but it was quite enjoyable.</p>
