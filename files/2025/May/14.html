        <h1>Wednesday 14th May</h1>
        <p>Another hot day. As usual on a Wednesday Angela went off with her walking group. They went down the river and found their way to the Hub!</p>
        <p>I took the TC off to Warnham to meet up with the Wanderers. The pub car park was pretty full when I got there, with a good selection of MGs. I didn't have a navigator, but Peter and Margaret's TC was having overheating problems, so Peter went with Mike in his mini and Margaret navigated for me. It was a pity that a road was closed, so we went on up to Dorking and back down the A24 back to Warnham. The run ended up being 40 miles, rather than the planned 25. So overall I drove 80 miles. And the car ran very well. However, the 'slow running' control is not working.</p>
