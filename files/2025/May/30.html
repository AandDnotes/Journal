        <h1>Friday 30th May</h1>
        <p>No rain today. In fact it became sunny and was quite warm. Angela went to the butchers and later went to the Steyning centre to play table tennis. I spent some time before lunch and later in the afternoon cleaning the garage door. It now looks very white.</p>
        <p>My other activity was to do a little more research on communicating between an Arduino and an iPad and started trying to 'rescue' the motor controller chip that lost a leg when I removed it from a breadboard. I prepared a piece of strip-board and inserted some pins. Now I need to try soldering all the chip pins.</p>
