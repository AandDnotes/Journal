        <h1>Sunday 11th May</h1>
        <p>A more productive day. While Angela went to a church service in Ashurst (with Ann) I took the TC to Beeding to get some petrol, doing my usual figure of eight. This was in preparation for Wednesday's Wanderers outing.</p>
        <p>I then found the errors in my accounts and, once corrected, everything balanced. However, when I started applying for an ISA for Angela with Kent Reliance, the nominated account did not match our Barclays account. Later I found that the nominated account associated with my KR accounts is the same. So I left a message on their system.</p>
        <p>After lunch I finished editing the recording of Tuesday's IET talk, filling in the gap with an image of one of the slides. After running it though HandBrake to reduce its size, it looks/sounds okay.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They had more birthday gatherings this afternoon, so we were a little later than usual. After dinner we had a shower of rain!</p>
