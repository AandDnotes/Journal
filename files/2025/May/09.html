        <h1>Friday 9th May</h1>
        <p>Today was a mixture of jobs outside and putting together the recording of Tuesday's IET talk. Angela did a lot of 'pottering' and pruning in the garden. I went out to clean the garage door, but only got as far as cleaning the fascia and surrounds.</p>
        <p>For the video, I started by putting the audio files from the microphone into iMovie and then added the video files. With some difficulty I tried to synchronise the audio tracks, repeating some parts so as to fill in the time when I had to replace the battery.</p>
