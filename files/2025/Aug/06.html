        <h1>Wednesday 6th August</h1>
        <p>This was our free day in Banff. Considering how late we had got to bed, we were up fairly early and had breakfast in the hotel. Then we walked into the town. Very picturesque, but full of tourists (like us). We just had a chewy bar in the park for our lunch before walking back to the hotel.</p>
        <p>I had bought tickets for the Gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain, but by late afternoon it was raining! Nevertheless, e caught the 'Roam' bus from near the hotel to the Gondola. We then went up early, walked around the exhibitions (on three floors) and then came down early, getting a free bus back into the town.</p>
        <p>It had stopped raining by this time and after a lot of searching we had a mixture of pizzas, which were good value, very tasty, but too much to eat. Then we walked back to the hotel.</p>
