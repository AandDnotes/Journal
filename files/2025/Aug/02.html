        <h1>Saturday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>We were a little more active today and it wasn't raining. In fact it was sunny and warm all day. Victoria and Brandon went off early to view a couple of houses and we had showers. We were still making sandwich lunches when they returned, but we were soon off to the Botanical Gardens, which are only a five minute drive away.</p>
        <p>The gardens were quite small and the butterfly house had fewer butterflies in it than there were outside. However, it was quite enjoyable. Juniper and Brandon ate their lunch while we were there (at about eleven), but we brought ours home to eat.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was time to help assembling shelving and bookcases and empty all the boxes of books. I collapsed the box for them to use next time they move! Prior to that I helped Austin build some shelves in his bedroom and then I helped Victoria build some in the garage. They are very sturdy stainless steel affairs. Brandon managed to clear a lot of the garage.</p>
        <p>We were all quite tired after that, but later had a nice roast chicken dinner. Paul sent us a couple of photos from Ibiza.</p>
