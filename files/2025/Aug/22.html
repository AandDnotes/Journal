        <h1>Friday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>While Angela walked to the library and High Street I started preparing an html template and style sheet for a page (or several) about our trip to Canada and the US. Then I went into the garage, lifted the front wheels off the ground so that I could move the steering, and greased the front suspension and steering joints. So the next job is to try to start the engine and give it a run.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis during the afternoon and I experimented a little more with my Canada web page. I also tracked down a seller of the 'lead replacement' that I've used since I've had the car and ordered another bottle.</p>
