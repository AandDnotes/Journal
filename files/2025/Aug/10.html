        <h1>Sunday 10th August</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day and Angela is feeling better. She had a bowl of yogurt, some toast and a cup of tea for breakfast. I had orange juice and oatmeal (with banana, strawberries, blueberries, nuts and maple syrup), plus some of Angela's toast. Although she didn't eat anything else until dinner.</p>
        <p>After breakfast we spoke with Paul, plus a wave from Krista and Rowan. Then we went for a walk.</p>
        <p>We went further than I had expected. Firstly we went down to the harbour and stopped for a coffee. Then we walked along the seafront, all the way to the totem poles in Stanley Park, before turning around and returning to the hotel. In total we walked a little under ten kilometres! Although slowly.</p>
        <p>When we got back I went for a swim, although the pool was more crowded than yesterday. Then we went for dinner in the hotel restaurant. It was not very busy. We paid by cash, since we need to try to use up all our 'paper' Canadian dollars.</p>
