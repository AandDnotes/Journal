        <h1>Saturday 16th August</h1>
        <p>We both had a good night's sleep, but still feel quite tired. I, however, feel a lot better, although I'm still coughing well.</p>
        <p>After a shower (I have been sweating a lot during the night) we walked to the High Street, albeit quite slowly. We bought a newspaper and a few other items of food. When we got back and had read some of the newspaper I did the weekly accounts, which, of course, covered four weeks. I have jet to reconcile my spreadsheet against the bank statement.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. The children had managed their first week at their new schools well. Austin had caught the bus to and from school every day. His classes had been rearranged so that more support is available. He is happy that they have a period at the end of each day when he can do his homework and Juniper has made a friend who also walks to and from school. V &amp; B have also looked at about five houses that have been on the market for some while.</p>
        <p>I did a little more to the RCEA August newsletter.</p>
