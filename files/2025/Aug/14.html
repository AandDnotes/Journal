        <h1>Thursday 14th August</h1>
        <p>Another day under fog of a head cold. I sorted out a few things and opened an NS&amp;I bond for Angela, thus moving more of our savings into Angel's name. This is in the hope that my savings income will come down and bring me out of the higher tax bracket. I also tracked down the 'non-sterling fees' from Barclays. There were from several trips to the Netherlands when I used the debit card and nothing to do with our recent trip.</p>
        <p>Then I managed to put some things away, but that was as much as I could manage, although I did start investigating broadband alternatives, since the Virgin Media package is going up a lot.</p>
