        <h1>Sunday 31st August</h1>
        <p>The last day of meteorological summer! And I don't think it rained, although there was a lot of cloud around. In fact I spent most of the day in the study.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I emailed Norman Wong to ask if he could video the first talk of the season in Crawley. I then took a couple of photos of the camera and microphone and wrote a page of notes about them.</p>
        <p>Then it was back to my web pages about our Canada/US trip. I completed the page on Banff and started the page on the Rocky Mountaineer.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we had a chat with Paul. Rowan is back to school next week, with a part-day introduction on Tuesday and then full days thereafter. She has to start school at 8:20 every day!</p>
