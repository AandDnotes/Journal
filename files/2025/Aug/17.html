        <h1>Sunday 17th August</h1>
        <p>I had a reasonable night's sleep, but still feel tired. While Angela went to church I worked on the RCEA newsletter. Luckily both Mike and Derek responded quickly to some questions and I was able to send out a draft for review before lunch. They both responded with some corrections, so now I just need to wait for Glyn before completing it.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They are painting the planking on the barn. This involves setting up the scaffold tower, cleaning the boards and then painting them. A slow process.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day I was feeling quite good.</p>
