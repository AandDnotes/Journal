        <h1>Monday 11th August</h1>
        <p>We had to check out of the hotel by 11am, Although we could leave ouur bags with the concierge. So after breakfast we packed and checked out. Angela wanted to buy a postcard to send to Claudia, but we couldn't find anywhere that sold them until we got down to the harbour.</p>
        <p>We picked up our bags, walked to the station and took the SkyTrain (which is mostly underground) to the airport. Since we were too early to check in we decided to have a chicken burger. This was a mistake since I'd forgotten that we had pre-ordered a meal (three courses) on the flight! We didn't eat it.</p>
        <p>So we had a sleepless overnight flight to Reykjav√≠k. We then had about an hour before the flight to Gatwick. On the first flight we were in row 23 (of 28) and on the second flight we were in row 28! By the time that we got to the railway station we only had ten minutes to wait for a train to Shoreham. By this time Angela was feeling alright, although tired, but I wasn't feeling too well.</p>
        <p>There were no taxis at the station, so we walked to the High Street. The posted timetable for the number 2 was completely wrong. We ended up waiting for about an hour before the Steyning bus arrived. A little while before it came, Christina, from across the road, came, on her way home from work.</p>
        <p>It was six o'clock before we got home! While I 'turned on the house', Angela went down to the village to buy some milk, etc. We had a spaghetti carbonara and managed to stay awake to watch the news.</p>
