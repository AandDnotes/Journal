        <h1>Sunday 24th August</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church as usual and I spent (wasted) most of the day trying to find a way of getting audio route instructions for the SDR. I will have a GPX file, which I can import into Kurvier (on the iPhone). Then I can re-build the route (perhaps) in the web version of Kurvier. Then I can save it to the Kurvier cloud. I can download it from there into the iPhone. The article in the MGOCC Bulletin then says that you select 'follow' mode. It will not give audio directions, but when I tried it in 'simulation' mode, Angela heard the instructions via her hearing aids. So perhaps it will work if I buy some cheap bluetooth ear buds.</p>
        <p>After lunch, since Paul et al were at a birthday BBQ, we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe.</p>
