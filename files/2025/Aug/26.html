        <h1>Tuesday 26th August</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. While Angela walked to the High Street I 'built' a route on Kuvier from home to the Merrow park and ride at Guildford. We are going there tomorrow so that Angela can meet up with her school friends. Later my Bluetooth ear buds arrived. After charging them I 'connected' them to my phone and when I ran the route in simulation mode I heard the instructions. Next I need to test it on the route. I will need to turn on mobile data to do this.</p>
        <p>While Angela did some housework I found out how to get a link to work on text within a grid cell. I had to raise the text in the stack.</p>
        <p>I added details of the Worthing College venue to my talk venues document and uploaded a pdf version to the IET Network home page.</p>
        <p>Then I joined the CC-UK committee meeting, where we agreed to take the initiative and tell the CRC that we will continue with our work.</p>
