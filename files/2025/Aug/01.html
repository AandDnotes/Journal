        <h1>Friday 1st August</h1>
        <p>A quieter day, not doing much. We were early to bed and late to get up. It rained heavily during the morning, so we mainly sat around. After a late lunch Victoria and Angela went to the supermarket, Juniper did some 'craft' and Austin and I wired the Arduino/strip-board and got the Bluetooth control working. However, I couldn't get the 'serial print' statements to output tot he IDE.</p>
        <p>After that Austin built a car. It worked, but not very well. He then gave up and I had a try, but he has limited blocks since most are built into models that he doesn't want to break up.</p>
