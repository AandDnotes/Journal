        <h1>Saturday 30th August</h1>
        <p>To our surprise, the morning started sunny and calm, although we had a little drizzle as we walked to the High Street. Later in the morning I updated the weekly accounts and then worked on our Canada/US web pages.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Actually she talked to us, telling us about all the houses that they'd looked at! For some reason, during this call, I developed a headache and felt very tired. I sat with my eyes closed while Angela prepared dinner.</p>
