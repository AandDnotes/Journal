        <h1>Friday 15th August</h1>
        <p>Following a bad night I woke up feeling a lot better. Unfortunately that was short-lived. During the morning I had a bout of diarrhoea with a side of nausea. I started to feel a bit better afterwards.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to the village again, although she is feeling very tired. She also continued to potter in the garden. I managed to set up the maturity option on two of our ISAs, after some confusion over which bond was which. Then I sent off my registration form this year's SDR and started putting together the RCEA's August newsletter.</p>
