        <h1>Saturday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>We started Saturday with our usual walk down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. And, as usual, I followed this with an update to the accounts for the week.</p>
        <p>A little later I started the TC and took it for a run. I had to 'tap' the fuel pump to get it 'ticking', but it drove well on my usual figure of eight run. The carburettors didn't seem to leak, apart from the fuel supply banjo bolt on the front carb.</p>
        <p>I decided to order a new broadband/phone contract with BT. It will be slower than our existing full-fibre broadband from Virgin Media. Since the existing contract ends on a Sunday, I chose the Friday to start the new one. Unfortunately, that caused VM to say that I had to pay an early exit fee. However, the BT account would not let me change the date. After talking to someone at BT it seems that changes can't be made until Openreach have confirmed an installation date. So I should be able to change the date on Tuesday (Monday is a bank holiday). Alternatively, I could claim the fee back from BT.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a FaceTime call with Victoria. Claudia and Gene were with them, so we told the about our experience on the Rocky Mountaineer.</p>
        <p>At a couple of times during the day I experimented further with my web page for our Canada/USA trip.</p>
