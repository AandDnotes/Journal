        <h1>Tuesday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our 53rd wedding anniversary. We didn't expect to spend most of it in Toronto airport! The shuttle bus got us there in plenty of time and we checked our bags before going through security and found our gate. We were early, although several people had started gathering. Then we noticed on the display board that our flight had been cancelled! It seems that some people had received an email saying this and some had received alternative bookings. I tried calling Porter airlines, but my phone said I couldn't access that number. Another passenger let me use her phone and it seems that we had been re-booked to Calgary via Montreal.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the flight was much later, so we would miss our bus to Banff. WE were now due to arrive at 10:30pm in Calgary, which was the time of the last bus. So we decided to cancel the bus and take a taxi. I also emailed the hotel and Rocky Mountaineer to say that we would be late; Banff is one and a half hours drive from Calgary.</p>
        <p>We landed a little before 10:30, but the bags took a long time to come out. That is, most other people's bags did. Our's didn't appear! Eventually a man came to the Porter baggage desk, but could only suggest that we wait a while and then complete an online form about delayed bags. My phone was running out of power, but I managed to join the airport wi-fi and complete the form. Eventually, at about 1:30, we gave up and went out to get a taxi. Only 'limousines' were available, at $100 more than a normal taxi. But we took it and arrived at the hotel at about 3am. Angela's Post Office card would not work, so I had to pay using my credit card, which is near its limit. We got to bed at about four!</p>
        <p>So it was 4 am before we got to bed!</p>
