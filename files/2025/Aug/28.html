        <h1>Thursday 28th August</h1>
        <p>We are back into our routine of doing the weekly shop on Thursday. So Angela drove to Lyons Farm, we started in Lidl, went to Sainsbury's to buy a few more things and then went on to Findon Vale for coffee, to find a small tree to replace one in the pot by the front door and to buy something for a Christmas present for Kate and Dick.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela finished clearing weeds from the drive, planted the new little tree and pottered in the garden.</p>
        <p>I emailed the editor of the MG Octagon Club Bulletin about using Kurvier and then tried to get a photo on my Toronto web page to open a large version. But the link covers all the text, rather than just the photo.</p>
        <p>These activities were interrupted by an email from Victoria to say that they've made an offer on a house (with a pool). So we spent some time looking at the photos.</p>
