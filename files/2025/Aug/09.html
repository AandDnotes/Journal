        <h1>Saturday 9th August</h1>
        <p>I had a good night's sleep, but Angela is not feeling well. So I started by going to a nearby pharmacy to get her some imodium equivalent. She went back to bed and I went for breakfast.</p>
        <p>Angela spent most of the day sleeping, although we did go for a couple of gentle walks. The major event was an email from the Post Office. So we went to a bank and reset Angela's money card. I went to a local cafe for some lunch.</p>
        <p>On one walk (after the bank) we found the SkyTrain station that we will use on Monday to get to the airport. The other walk was to a nearby park, where there was a farmer's market. We also walked around some of the back-streets. After that we went into a supermarket and I bought a sandwich, a muffin and a nectarine.</p>
        <p>When we got back to the hotel I went for a swim. Angela didn't eat anything all day, but seems to be improving. We tried watching some TV. but they are mostly advertisements.</p>
