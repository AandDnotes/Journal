        <h1>Friday 29th August</h1>
        <p>We had torrential rain over night and it continued during breakfast. But then the rain stopped and it became quite bright. So we walked to the High Street to the butchers and to the pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription.</p>
        <p>While Angela did some housework I continued documenting our trip to Canada and the US. By the end of the day I had completed my notes on Toronto (including Niagra Falls), Lee's Summit and Fayetteville. I also started on Banff.</p>
