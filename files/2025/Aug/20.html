        <h1>Wednesday 20th August</h1>
        <p>We were woken by the builder's skip next door being collected. I saw Katie (and Neville) later when I was walking down to the High Street. They have dismissed their builder and will get the final 'snags' done by others.</p>
        <p>While Angela went off walking with her friends I thought I would add a little to the summary slide at the end of my SMR deck. In the process I discovered that Sizewell B is, in fact, a PWR, so I had to add a slide about it. So this all took longer than I'd expected.</p>
        <p>Then I walked down to the High Street to get some bread flour and lettuce.</p>
        <p>As Angela left so she brought in the number 3 that had fallen off the front wall. So I cleaned the back of the number and the 'knobs'. One attachment on the number one had also come unstuck. I found that the epoxy hardener had gone hard! So I tried Evostick. It seemed to work quite well, but only time will tell.</p>
        <p>Later I went into the garage and put the inside of the TC back together. Then I emptied the tonneau area, removed the floor and topped up the oil in the differential. I also checked and topped-up the rear dampers. After putting the tonneau area back I topped-up the nearside front damper.</p>
        <p>During the day I also found a free map app that says it can import a GPX file and give audio turn-by-turn instructions as well as off-line maps. I also investigated what I could get in the way of a wired 12V to USB adapter, so that I could power my phone from the TC's inspection lamp socket.</p>
