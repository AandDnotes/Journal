        <h1>Tuesday 19th August</h1>
        <p>I emailed Deshi et al early with an update on Mike's communication problems. I then emailed Porter airlines (or their agent) about our claim for the taxi fare.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the library and some shops while I started adding to my slide set for the talk on SMRs. This required some research.</p>
        <p>Later I went into the garage to check the TC's brake fluid level and gearbox oil level. This meant taking out the front carpet to get to the master cylinder. I found that the mechanic had 'bent' the cover plate rather than let it slide under the gaiter. However, the fluid level was very good.</p>
        <p>With the carpets out I decided to remove the gearbox cover so as to get a true measure of the oil level. That took quite a lot of effort, but the oil level was spot-on. Now I just need to get it all back together!</p>
