        <h1>Monday 25th August</h1>
        <p>Bank holiday; not that it really affects us. Angela went to her Monday Club, which was held in Phylis's house and I went blackberrying in the playing fields and also went up Newham Lane to get some apples. As it happened, Angela was given some apples, so she cooked the all this afternoon and we had blackberry and apple crumble for desert.</p>
        <p>I was planning to buy some Bluetooth ear buds from Curry's, but discovered that they used a more recent version of Bluetooth than my phone supports. So I ordered cheap ones from Amazon.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time adding the svg arrows to my web page on our Canada/US trip and we booked tickets to see 'Top Hat' at Chichester a week on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Paul. So quite a busy day.</p>
