        <h1>Thursday 7th August</h1>
        <p>After some confusion in the hotel lobby (there was a large tour group of Australians as well as our group) we boarded the coach to take us to Banff station to board the Rocky Mountaineer.</p>
        <p>After a welcome by the staff we had breakfast. Then, on our route to Kamloops, we saw a lot of fir trees, a lot of rivers and a lot of mountains, but no wildlife.</p>
        <p>At Kamloops we were bussed to our hotel. We had already been checked in and our cases were in our rooms. It was all very efficient.</p>
