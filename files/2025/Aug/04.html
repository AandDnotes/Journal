        <h1>Monday 4th August</h1>
        <p>Everyone was up early so that Victoria could take us to NW Arkansas airport. Google maps took us by the scenic route (avoiding highways), which was interesting, but twisty. I don't think Juniper appreciated it.</p>
        <p>So we got to Toronto via Atlanta and caught the shuttle bus to our hotel, which was not in a particularly good area. In fact, the hotel was directly under the flightpath of landing aircraft!</p>
        <p>All we did was go out to a 'transport cafe' for dinner.</p>
