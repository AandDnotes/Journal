        <h1>Monday 18th August</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to her Monday Club while I reconciled the bank statement against my spreadsheet. To my surprise it all worked. I then did the monthly accounts for August.</p>
        <p>I had emailed Deshi, etc. about a choice of 'south-coast' venue since we had not heard from Mike U. Then he phoned. It seems that he had changed his phone service (and presumably broadband) to EE, had been without internet access for 16 days and had to go outside to get a phone signal. He said that he now had email, but I've heard nothing from him.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela went to give blood (which they wouldn't take) I checked over the two cars. I also topped up the TC's oil, put some grease into the water pump and oil into the tachometer-gear (using a thin tube).</p>
