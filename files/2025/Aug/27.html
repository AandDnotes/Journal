        <h1>Wednesday 27th August</h1>
        <p>At 10:30 we left for Guildford. Unfortunately the Kurvier app on my phone (with mobile data on and connected to my new ear buds), when set to 'Follow' did not produce any sound. The screen did, however, follow the route, as it turned out without using any data.</p>
        <p>Having delivered Angela to her friends at the bus station in Guildford I went off and bought a phone holder to fit into the TC so that I could follow the route visually. Then I explored the library.</p>
        <p>Following lunch in M&amp;S I walked down to the river and then returned to the library. There I read and replied to email until it was time to meet Angela, Carol and June. We then went for a cup of tea until it was time to meet June's husband, who had been for a ten-mile walk with a friend.</p>
        <p>After catching the bus to the Park &amp; Ride car park, we got home at 6:45. We were lucky in that we dodged rain showers all day.</p>
