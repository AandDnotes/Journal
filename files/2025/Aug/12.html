        <h1>Tuesday 12th August</h1>
        <p>I slept quite well, although I'm not sure that Angela did. We got up for some breakfast, but I couldn't eat it all. So I went back to bed and slept for the rest of the morning. I can't remember what happened for the rest of the day apart from trying to heat one mug of milk in the microwave and it boiling over so that most of it was on the turntable or running down the front onto the worktop! Then it was definitely time for bed, again.</p>
