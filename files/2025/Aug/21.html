        <h1>Thursday 21st August</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. This was the first time that I'd driven for over four weeks. We started at Lidl, bought a few items in Sainsbury's and then went to Findon Vale. Angela bought a plant (that was reduced).</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the health centre where I 'posted' my repeat prescription. Then, while Angela removed some of the weeds on the drive, I topped up the offside front damper and checked that there was still oil in the steering box.</p>
        <p>I also found that the 'Scenic' app needed to be purchased and so experimented with the Kurviger app, which I installed on the MacBook.</p>
        <p>I had a phone call from Juliet at the WSMGOC who had received a call from someone wanting to buy a TC. She will email him my phone numbers.</p>
