        <h1>Sunday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>This morning we got up to the smell of pancakes being cooked. It was a mainly sunny and not too hat day, so we went to an art museum on the outskirts of Bentonville, about half an hour away.</p>
        <p>There were outside tracks with various artworks along the way. We only went a short way, since, although early, it was quite warm and the children have an aversion to walking. If anything, it was too cool inside the very interesting building. It was on multiple levels with interesting roof spans and ponds. We walked around half the galleries, mainly containing 'modern' art, before stopping for lunch under one of the interesting roofs. After that we went into a craft area, where we left Brandon and the children while we walked around the other half of the gallery.</p>
        <p>We were home just in time to get a call from Paul and Rowan from their hotel room in Ibiza. They seem to be having a good time. Victoria and Brandon had already gone back out to buy a mattress. One that comes in a box! I managed to check in for our flights in the morning and complete the Canada customs forms.</p>
        <p>After a good dinner we all played a game about plants.</p>
