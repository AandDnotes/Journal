        <h1>Tuesday 24th June</h1>
        <p>I started by sending Victoria details of the flights I had booked. Then, while Angela went to the High Street (and got wet) I started completing the passenger information for our flights. I can't do the Airtransat flight until I check in, which is the day before we fly. However, I did the two Delta Airways flights.</p>
        <p>Another task was to write down some details of the problem with the pressure washer.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time looking at the Bluetooth car control system. I soldered pint to the power converter and pushed it into the breadboard. The Bluetooth interface works, but I had to modify the software to get one of the problems. However, there are more to resolve.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I attended the IET Sussex committee meeting.</p>
