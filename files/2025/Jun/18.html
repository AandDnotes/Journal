        <h1>Wednesday 18th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Coolham with her walking group to walk around the Quaker Meeting House. I checked the email of notes for last Wednesdays PEI meeting before sending it out. Then I checked our current account after the latest credit card payment and updated my spreadsheet. I also tried running a part-complete sketch for the RC car, but the Bluetooth module wouldn't work. I found that the 5V from the Arduino did not provide enough current. Later I tried it with a separate 5V supply and the module lit up.</p>
        <p>The plumber arrive early and then went off to get a new ball valve. When he came back it didn't take long to replace the old one. He didn't know how it had ever worked, since the pipe to the elbow was too short and the olive just fell off! Once it was fixed I tried the to run water through the pressure washer. Water ran out the bottom! I tried pushing the white pin in, but it still leaked. I found that the water was pouring out of a moulded hole in the plastic water input unit. So I photographed it and sent a message to Karcher. Then I gave the owner (Averil) an update.</p>
