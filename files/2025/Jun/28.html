        <h1>Saturday 28th June</h1>
        <p>Following our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper, the rest of the morning for me was spent on finances. I updated my weekly accounts spreadsheet and then withdrew all the money from a matured bond with Virgin Money. When the money had arrived in our current account I opened an NS&amp;I one-year bond in Angela's name, using most of the money withdrawn. I left some in our account to cover the credit card expenditures that we did recently and have yet to do. Angela did some washing and housework.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleaned (wiped over) the TC bodywork and interior. I still have to clean the wheels and under the bonnet. When I took the spare wheel off to clean the petrol tank (and the wheel) I found that the sender unit is leaking again! The hold-up bolts on the carburettors are also leaking, so I need to buy some new washers and gaskets.</p>
        <p>We had a short message exchange with Victoria. Their final belongings were due to be packed this afternoon and they will start their drive to Lee's Summit early tomorrow. It will take them two full days to get there, since Brandon will need to charge his car a couple of times on the way. U-Haul are due to pick up their boxes tomorrow after Victoria et al have left. They will contact us next when they arrive.</p>
