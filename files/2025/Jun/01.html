        <h1>Sunday 1st June</h1>
        <p>My 77th birthday, although I told Rowan that I was seven! It was dry, quite bright and reasonably warm, although a little breezy.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church and, apart form a a conversation with Alan, I spent most of the day 'playing' with the bluetooth module. Eventually I managed to get characters sent from an iPhone app displayed in the serial monitor of the Arduino. I had been using the revised Arduino IDE incorrectly and I needed to interface the HM-10 via the software serial interface (using a library) so that the IDE could be used to view what was happening via print statements.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon, a little later than usual, since they had been swimming and to Ikea.</p>
        <p>So I ended my birthday in a more satisfied state.</p>
