        <h1>Tuesday 17th June</h1>
        <p>I started by booking a place at the SADCASE car show at Amberley on Sunday. I have yet to receive the ticket. I also replied to Victoria, who had asked when we planned to return to Toronto.</p>
        <p>At various times during the day I completed the notes on last Thursday's PEI meeting. I just need to check it and then send it out. I also set out to try flushing the Karcher pressure washer to remove air in the machine. However, when I tried to open the ball valve under the sink for the outside tap, water sprayed out in the cupboard. I tried giving the compression fitting a tighten, but it made no difference. So Angela asked John and Felicity if they had used a local plumber. I then arranged for them to come tomorrow afternoon. Later I checked the wiring on the machine, and found that the power switch was not working. After lubricating it and pulling out the detergent 'plunger', the switch seemed to work. So now I just need to test it when our outside tap is fixed.</p>
