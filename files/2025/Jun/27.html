        <h1>Friday 27th June</h1>
        <p>Brandon's birthday. It was a little late in the day before I sent him a 'happy birthday' email and transferred some money into Victoria's account. We started off a little later than usual, walking down to the library, the museum and the High Street. My book (Material World) was due for renewal, Angela wanted to replace the book on Canada and she had finished reading her novel. It was the first time that we had been in the museum for many years. Angela had wanted to see their new 'Bunkers' exhibit, but the whole thing was very good. We need to go there again to read more about Steyning.</p>
        <p>So it was nearly midday by the time we got home. After lunch I took the TC for a 'warm-up' drive, having raised the carburettor jets by one flat, and then adjusted the tappets. I had intended adjusting the timing, but 'chicken'd out'.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the PEI discussion that was due to take place on Monday. It was an initial discussion on what we would want from a 'joint' view of our events. Luckily, my only action was to organise the next session.</p>
