        <h1>Monday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went off to her Monday club and I had another look at the pressure washer. Having plugged the hole where water was squirting out, water came out around the detergent inlet. So I put it back together (minus the plug) and phoned the owner. She is away until next week, but asked if I could not what I had found in case she takes it to the service place in Horsham.</p>
        <p>Then our ESTA approvals arrived. I had told Victoria the flights I was thinking of booking, so I booked them, along with the hotel when we arrive in Toronto and the hotel when we get back to Toronto airport. So now everything is booked for our trip to Canada/USA. Now I have to complete the advanced information for the flights and work out how much money we need to take with us.</p>
