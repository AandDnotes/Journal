        <h1>Thursday 19th June</h1>
        <p>A hot day with clear blue sky from morning to night. Apparently it has beed the hottest day of the year so far, but is likely to be beaten tomorrow! Considering the temperature, we've had quite a busy day.</p>
        <p>We started by going off to Lidle, Sainsbury's and Boots at Lyons Farm to do our weekly groceries shop. Then we indulged in coffee at the Jungle Cafe, between Ashington and Wiston, not the most direct way home. After an early lunch we walked down to the Health Centre for our RSV jabs. So we are now up to date.</p>
        <p>I made a list (in Reminders) of the things that we still had to do for our holiday, apart from anything associated with Victoria et al's move. So I booked a hotel at Gatwick airport for the night before our flight to Toronto and then booked and printed our rail tickets to get to Gatwick and back. The return tickets are open, since our return time could vary. There are still a few things we can do, such as apply for our Canadian eTA and US ESTA.</p>
