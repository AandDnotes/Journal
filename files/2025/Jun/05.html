        <h1>Thursday 5th June</h1>
        <p>Not only was it grocery shopping day, but Angela had to buy ingredients for Monday's lunch club. So we went to Morrisons in Worthing to buy our own groceries and the chicken, etc. for lunch club. We then went to Waitrose for coffee and to get a few extra things. We dropped off most of the items at the church on our way home.</p>
        <p>After lunch I continued putting together a breadboard to test my repaired motor controller chip. It is now ready to test.</p>
