        <h1>Friday 6th June</h1>
        <p>This morning the weather couldn't decide if it was going to rain or not. S, dressed in cagoules, Angela went to the butchers and I went to the pharmacy to collect my tablets. In fact I met Angela in the High Street and she came to the pharmacy with me. We were a bit wet by the time we got home, as was the washing that Angela had hung out before we left. Luckily the day then brightened up, although stayed breezy.</p>
        <p>So the washing dried and the library rang to say that the book that Angela had ordered was ready to be collected. Actually the book was for me, but ordered on Angela's ticket. Mine had been deleted from the system! So Angela went out again.</p>
        <p>Yesterday I thought that I'd finished wiring my motor controller test circuit. However, not only had I plugged some wires into the wrong holes on the breadboard and left some off altogether. Having corrected it, I wrote a sketch to test the motor chip. Actually I copied parts of what someone had posted online. And my repaired chip worked!. I then modified my circuit to include two switched, one to switch between the D-switch and the joystick and the other to throttle down the speed of the motor.</p>
