        <h1>Monday 16th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to her Monday club and I started putting together the notes from Thursday's PEI meeting. But the mouse battery was low, so I did a little on the RC car software.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the Karcher machine apart. The outer wiring of the motor have electrical continuity, but I couldn't see how to get at the pressure switch. So I put it back together and took the connector off our hosepipe so as to try clearing any air lock. But I ran out of time, so will try tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We had an email from Victoria about her driving us from Toronto to Kansas City.</p>
