        <h1>Tuesday 10th June</h1>
        <p>Whilst Angela showered I emptied the boiler cupboard because we were expecting the British Gas service engineer for our annual service. He was due to come between ten and two, but BG phoned to say that he had been delayed. He arrived at about 2:30 and had finished by three.</p>
        <p>We had both received emails from Virgin Money saying that a bond was about to mature. I chose to re-invest Angela's, but couldn't find an option to take out the cash. Eventually I discovered that I need to wait for it to mature!</p>
        <p>Angela took a mis-delivered letter to the right house and lunch club cash to Linda's. I soldered leads on a switch and finished wiring up my RC car circuit and tested driving the motors with my test sketch.</p>
