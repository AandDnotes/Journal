        <h1>Thursday 26th June</h1>
        <p>Since we both wanted to look for clothes to take on holiday with us, we decided to do the weekly grocery shop at Holmbush so that we could go into M&amp;S. In fact we also went into Next. Angela couldn't find anything, but I bought a shirt.</p>
        <p>Not a lot happened after lunch apart from doing our Dutch lessons and reading. However, after dinner I attended an online meeting between IET and IMechE members about joint events.</p>
