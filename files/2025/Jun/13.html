        <h1>Friday 13th June</h1>
        <p>Today was all about helping others and it was a very warm and sunny day. We started by going to Phylis's to help her do her online food hygiene course. That took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC to Peter B's in The Crescent. Rosie had gone into Croft Meadow for respite. So I took Peter for a drive, just up to Partridge Green and back down through Henfield. He seemed to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Later I spent a short while redesigning my RC Lego car software design.</p>
