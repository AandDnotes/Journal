        <h1>Saturday 7th June</h1>
        <p>After our usual walk to the High Street I checked on our bus ride from Calgary to Banf, which I found I had already booked, and then did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Since we were going out in the evening we had our main meal at lunchtime. We'd just finished when Victoria messaged, so we just had time to clear up and make coffee before she FaceTime'd. Brandon's visit to Arkansas had gone well. He is now just waiting to see if they offer him the job, which he would like if they do. He will be disappointed if he doesn't hear on Monday! But then he is impatient.</p>
        <p>After a little tea we went to the Assembly Hall in Worthing to hear a concert. A Chinese pianist played Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1. The whole concert was very good. After a dry, but windy day, the forecast storm arrived as we were driving over the Downs. Luckily it stopped by the time we got to Worthing.</p>
