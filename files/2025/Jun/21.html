        <h1>Saturday 21st June</h1>
        <p>The summer solstice and a hot one, although cloudier than expected. We made our usual trip to the High Street and I spent some time testing the pressure washer after plugging up the hole from which the water was spurting. It burst into life for about one second and then leaked water from the body!</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Brandon has officially ben offered the job in Arkansas, left his job in Canada, signed a lease on a house in Fayetteville (that they haven't seen, not even a photo) and planned their move! We said that we could spend a few days in Toronto before travelling to them. So now need to work out how to do it.</p>
