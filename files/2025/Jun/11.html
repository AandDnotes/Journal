        <h1>Wednesday 11th June</h1>
        <p>Before Angela went off with her walking group I left in the TC to go Lyminster. I left the TC at David F-B's house and we went off in his TR4A for the Wanderers run. It stayed cloudy until lunchtime, but it was a good run. I got home before three.</p>
        <p>After tea I joined the PEI Group meeting. It went on a bit longer than planed and we agreed to hold two additional, targeted meetings, one on how we organise joint meetings with the IMechE and the other on how to share event details more easily.</p>
