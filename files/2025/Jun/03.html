        <h1>Tuesday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>It started raining quite early and didn't stop until just before Angela went out at 6:45. And it was cold.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the day 'playing' with my Bluetooth communications, using various parts of MicroBlue. I also soldered the motor controller chip to a piece of strip-board and the broken pin to the inserted pin. I have yet to test it!</p>
        <p>After tea, Angela went to help serve refreshments at a talk in the Methodist Church and I had an Events sub-committee online meeting.</p>
