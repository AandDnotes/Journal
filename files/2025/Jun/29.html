        <h1>Sunday 29th June</h1>
        <p>It was 'open gardens day' today, so Angela took her lunch to church and stayed to help provide teas and coffees to those going around the gardens. It was a very fine day and they had a lot of visitors. Angela got home just before we spoke with Paul.</p>
        <p>At various times during the day I spent some time on my Bluetooth controlled Lego car. It took some time to insert a way of stopping the code. I added a little more to the strip-board design.</p>
        <p>I also went into the garage and cleaned under the bonnet of the TC. Just the wheels to clean and then apply some polish.</p>
