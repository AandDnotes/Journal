        <h1>Monday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>A fine, sunny and warm day. Angela went to her Monday Club, getting home just before lunch. I spent the morning 'playing' with my Bluetooth module (HM-10) and Arduino. I couldn't get the iPhone App that I'd hoped to use to send characters to the HM-10. At least, the Arduino was not reading them. Luckily I later found another App (MicroBlue), that is produced by a provider of robot kits, that did work and has good documentation. I also tidied-up my test sketch.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did the monthly accounts and Angela worked in the garden. In between work on the accounts I helped finish off some pruning.</p>
