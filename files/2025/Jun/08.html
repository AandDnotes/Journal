        <h1>Sunday 8th June</h1>
        <p>After yesterday evening's storm it was a relief to see dry roads and sunshine this morning. I had a tiring day. I left home at nine in the TC, drove to Beeding to get some petrol and then on to Burgess Hill to the annual car show, a distance of 16 miles. Meanwhile, Angela went to church and then later went down there again to cut back an errant rose.</p>
        <p>There were many cars at the show and, since the weather was fine, lots of visitors. I looked at the assortment of cars, read some of my book and talked to onlookers (as well as a few members of the WSMGOC who were there). I put more petrol in the TC on my way back through Beeding so that I am prepared for The Wanderers run on Wednesday. The car ran well there and back. One person showed som interest in buying the car, but it was a tiring day.</p>
