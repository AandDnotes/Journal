        <h1>Monday 30th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went to her Monday Club while I booked our day trip to Niagara Falls in July. To my surprise, the credit card company emailed to say that we had exceeded 90% of our credit limit. So I spent quite some time putting together a spreadsheet of our transactions. It's difficult from the online view to see which transactions fall into which monthly payment, but now I have a better view. So I then booked our return rail tickets from Toronto airport to Union Station.</p>
        <p>It was even hotter today, so I decided not start taking wheels off the TC, but sent a note of the actions to the PEI sub-group, an email to Sam B about Adestra and worked on my strip-board for the RC car system. The latter is complete, but needs a thorough check.</p>
