        <h1>Friday 20th June</h1>
        <p>My only outdoor activity today was to have my hair cut. Otherwise I applied for our Canadian eTAs. For some reason, mine was approved immediately, but Angelas had to be reviewed. I also started applying for our US ETAs. They wanted an image of our passports and a selfie, which could not be the same image as that in the passport. They also wanted a US contact, so I saved the application and asked Victoria if we could use Gene.</p>
