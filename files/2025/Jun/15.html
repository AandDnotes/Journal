        <h1>Sunday 15th June</h1>
        <p>Another warm and mainly sunny day. I went off just before nine to Hove Park. It took a while to find the entrance, but then there was a long queue of cars trying to get into the site since they had to wait for a 'park run' to pass.</p>
        <p>The day was a bit of a waste of time, although Jim and Marilyn came by. They used to live in The Ridings, but have now moved to Billingshurst. Cars started leaving after lunch, so I left before three.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul.</p>
