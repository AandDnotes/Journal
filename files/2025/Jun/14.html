        <h1>Saturday 14th June</h1>
        <p>Another sunny and warm day. And we started as usual by going to the High Street, then I put my tools together for use at the Repair Cafe before doing the weekly accounts. I also reconciled the bank statement against my spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Beeding village hall. It was quite quiet. I brought home a Karcher pressure washer, which font start. I also looked at a mixer and soldered a broken wire, but it still didn't work. So I said I would research the problem.</p>
        <p>When I got home we spoke with Victoria. Brandon has been offered and has accepted a job in Arkansas, although so far only verbally. He will start on July 9th! They have yet to work out how they will organise things.</p>
