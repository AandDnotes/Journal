        <h1>Sunday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church as usual, but I set off fairly early to the SADCASE event at the Amberley museum in the TC. I stopped for petrol at Storrington and then joint other WSMGOC members (only eight) inside the museum. It wasn't an ideal location for people to see my 'for sale' sign, but at least one person took a note of my phone number. It wasn't as hot as previous days, but there were sunny periods and the rain held off. I was home by 4:15.</p>
        <p>Then we spoke to Paul. Rowan was at a friend's house, designing a device that would catch an egg that would be dropped from the fourth floor, without it breaking.</p>
