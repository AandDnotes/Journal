        <h1>Monday 9th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to prepare for the lunch club (she was cooking) and I started preparing components for the RC car electronics. Later I started putting together the circuit on breadboards.</p>
        <p>Just before midday I went to Phylis's to help her take her trifles to the church and then helped clear up after the lunch. We were home just after 3:30.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening I took the TC to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. We had a talk from one of the Sussex 'blood bikers'.</p>
