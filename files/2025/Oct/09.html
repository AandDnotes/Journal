        <h1>Thursday 9th October</h1>
        <p>We had clear blue sky, with a minimal breeze, for nearly all the day. We started by going to Lyons Farm to do what was quite a small grocery shop. I also went to B&amp;Q to get some pipe insulation to put on the pipe supplying the outside tap. We then went to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch we drove to the dermatology clinic at Haywards Heath. The doctor decided that the patch on my nose was not a sqameous carcinoma, but a solar keratosis, which is pre-cancerous. She froze the area using liquid nitrogen, which should remove the affected area. Patrick phoned just as we were about to leave. The link that I'd sent him to see a note of a Sussex Wanderers outing did not work. For some reason the # had been replaced with a % sign! So I told him to select 'Outings' and go to 2025.</p>
        <p>When we got home I filled the back of the Panda with 'stuff' for our trip to the recycling centre at Shoreham in the morning.</p>
