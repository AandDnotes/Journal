        <h1>Sunday 26th October</h1>
        <p>A bright, but chilly morning, follwed by a coudy afternoon, with light rain in the evening. While Angela was at church I tracked down the money that was paid into our current account. It was a Tesco bond where I had inadvertantly selected that the interest should be paid into our account! I then paid my tax bill.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage and finished painting the mail box. I also put the water feature away and cleaned up the drip trays, which now do not have a car over them. I also changed the garage clock and the Panda's clock.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
