        <h1>Friday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>A lot of my time today was spent in the garage.</p>
        <p>This morning I removed the spare wheel holder on the TC so that I could clean up the area around the fuel sender and tighten the set screws. I then put some primer on the bare metal.</p>
        <p>Later, while Angela went to the High Street to get her hair cut, I coated the hood with water proofer. I also compiled a list of things that will go with the TC and sent it to Patrick.</p>
