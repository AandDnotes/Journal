        <h1>Thursday 16th October</h1>
        <p>Around breakfast time we noticed that the house phone beeped and that the wi-fi router was restarting. Then we realised that the power had gone off for a short time and we could not reset the clock on Angela's side of the bed.</p>
        <p>Then, as we were going out to do the weekly shop I noticed that the TC was still leaking fuel from the sender unit and disolving the paint. It was after we had been to Lidl, Sainsbury's and Boots and then on to Findon Vale (where Angela bought some plants for a trough on the wall and I bought some foldable slippers) before I was able to look at it. I removed the spare wheel carrier (again), cleaned off the soft paint, decided that the leak was from the electical contact and so tightened it. Then I applied another coat of paint.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I helped Angela with her Lunch Club accounts before turning my attention to the clock. Two of the buttons, those used to adjust the time, would not work, so I took the clock apart and squited the switches with contact cleaner. After a couple of squirts they worked, even though they appeared to be enclosed switches. So now the time on the clock can be adjusted.</p>
