        <h1>Wednesday 1st October</h1>
        <p>Angela went walking with her friends, going around the lower horseshoe. I spent some time trying to log into my Shawbrook account, but failed again. I phoned them again and was told that no two accounts can use the same mobile number. So I logged into Angela's account (which worked) and left a message to ask for Angela's mobile number to be changed from mine to hers. Hopefully then I'll be able to log into my account.</p>
        <p>I then spent time in the garage, cleaning under the rear wings. Later I cleaned all four wheels and put them back on the car. I had a short call from Patrick, asking about the ill-fitting hood.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre to see 'The Salt Path' film. It was a good story, although a bit slow and there was a lot of mumbling.</p>
