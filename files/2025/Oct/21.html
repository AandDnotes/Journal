        <h1>Tuesday 21st October</h1>
        <p>Quite a momentus day. It started sunny and while Angela went to the High Street to buy some food for a lunch with guests I started the TC and ran it for a short while. Then I spent the rest of the morning working on the RCEA newsletter.</p>
        <p>Patrick called at 12:15. They were just driving off the ferry at Dover! They arrived at about 2:45. I took Patrick for a very short run in the TC (just down to the Bramber roundabout and back) and then drove the car on to his trailer. We spent some time securing it (in the rain) before I took a photo and he called his import company. For some reason he had to send them a photo of the front page of the V5C.</p>
        <p>I then handed over the books, box and wheel. I tore off the appropriate part of the V5C and gave him the main part. They went off just after four, aiming for Ashford to deal with the export paperwork. Later I put the retained part of the V5C and a letter with the buyer's name and address into an envelope addressed to the VDLA.</p>
