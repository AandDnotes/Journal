        <h1>Monday 6th October</h1>
        <p>A warm and sunny day, with a much gentler breeze. While Angela went to her Monday Club, I reassembled David F-B's cassette player. It took a while to work out how the door opening spring fitted, but I cleaned the volume control resistor and got it all back together (with no screws left over). And it works!</p>
        <p>After that success I went into the garage and 'wiped over' the TC's paintwork.</p>
