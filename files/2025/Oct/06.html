        <h1>Monday 6th October</h1>
        <p>A warm and sunny day, with a much gentler breeze. While Angela went to her Monday Club, I reassembled David F-B's cassette player. It took a while to work out how the door opening spring fitted, but I cleaned the volume control resistor and got it all back together (with no screws left over). And it works!</p>
        <p>After that success I went into the garage and 'wiped over' the TC's paintwork. After lunch I touched up paint chips. So the car is now ready for wax polishing. I might just have enough wax left in the tin.</p>
        <p>So I finally got around to looking at producing some notes of the September PEI Group meeting. I downloaded the Zoom files (a 720p mp3 file, a smaller video file, an audio file and a text transcription of the audio). I tried to get MS Copilot to sumarise the audio from the video, but it wouldn't do that. Then it didn't like the audio file type or the text file type, but couldn't convert them. So I created an rtf file from the text file and got Copilot to summarise it. The first attempt was too brief, but the second seemed to cover most things, although I didn't reconcile it against the video recorning. So I attached that within the top and bottom of my usual email and sent it out. I also asked Colin for a link for the December meeting so that I can send out a calendar entry.</p>
