        <h1>Sunday 19th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had a special event at church this morning and into the afternoon. So she wasn't home until just before four. I started by sending Patrick some details of his route to us on Tuesday and then went into the garage to check the fuel sender. It was fine, so I started the car and let it warm up for a while. Then I started work on the recording of my IET talkon AI/ML. The sound level was lower than usual and the questions are difficult to hear.</p>
        <p>It started raining around lunchtime. When Angela got home (quite wet) we spoke with Paul. Paul and Rowan had survived Krista being away, but now Rowan is on half term holiday.</p>
