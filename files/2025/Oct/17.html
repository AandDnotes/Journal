        <h1>Friday 17th October</h1>
        <p>I started by refitting the TC's spare wheel carrier (and spare wheel) and then taking the car for my usual figure of eight test run. It took quite a while to start, but then ran well. I tried to syphon off some of the fuel in the tank, but, apart from getting a mouthful of petrool, the level was quite low as judged by my dipstick. So I left it alone.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the low fuel light was permanently on! When tightening the contact on the top of the sender unit I must have permanently earthed it. I tried rotating the connection bolt a bit, but that made no difference (and may have caused it to start leaking again) so I put some insulation tape over the terminal so that the light is permanently off.</p>
        <p>I also cleaned the plugs and topped up the engine oil.</p>
