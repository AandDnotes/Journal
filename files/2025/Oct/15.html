        <h1>Wednesday 15th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went walking with her friends (although I think there were only two others) before going to the Hub to meet up with others. I sorted out the equipment from the night before, uploading the video files and reducing there size to 1080p.</p>
        <p>After lunch we cleared the drive of some of the weeds and massacered a bush in front of the sitting room window. Then I 'played' with a revised version of our Trips web page, trying to get the background to go down as far as the end of the list of trips. I made progress, but still have the bottom to sort out.</p>
