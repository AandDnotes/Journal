        <h1>Monday 13th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to start setting up for the lunch club. I ironed two pair of trousers and then went down to the church to collect Phylis's deserts.After the meal I made tea and coffee for those who wanted it and helped put things away in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>When we got home we spoke with Victoria, before replying to an email from Patrick. He couldn't find the copy of the V5C that I'd sent him. I couldn't find it either, so I scanned it in again and sent it to him.</p>
        <p>After a light tea I went off to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington.</p>
