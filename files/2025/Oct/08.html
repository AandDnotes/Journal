        <h1>Wednesday 8th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking (to the White Bridge) and I drove to Kirdford to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. To my surprise, David F-B was not there. Even though he was within 200 yrds of the pub, his satnav sent him to the wrong pub (with the same name). So he was very late and we were the last to leave. Then there were two road closures! Otherwise it was a good route.</p>
        <p>I spent more time looking at my AI slide set and adding comments.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the meeting that had been set up to discuss PEI event coordination. Only Jason and I turned up! He is down in the detail, working from the bottom up. It might need a user requirements view.</p>
