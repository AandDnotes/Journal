        <h1>Tuesday 14th October</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Angela walked down to the High Street (twice) to buy a few things and I spent a good part of the morning running through the slides for talk in the evening.</p>
        <p>Since I would be out this evening (and get some sandwiches) we had an early main meal. Then I only just got to Peter W's in time to pick him up and drive to Field Place for the RCEA talk on AI in process control. It was interesting. However, we left a little late and so there was more traffic. I just got home in time to put all my bits a pieces into bags and go off to Worthing College to the talk.</p>
        <p>It was lucky that I left home a little earlier than planned, because the queue at Lyons Farm was very bad. I took me three quarters of an hour to get to Worthing College, although I was the first there. So I set up my laptop, got a couple of people to draw numbers and set up the camera.</p>
        <p>We only had 18 people in the audience, but the talk seemed to be well received. But I was exhausted by the time that I got home.</p>
