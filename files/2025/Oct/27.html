        <h1>Monday 27th October</h1>
        <p>I went off fairly early to Shoreham railway station to meet up with the other 'London walkers'. After coffee at Victoria we caught the tube/DLR to the tunnel opposite Greenwich. After walking through the tunnel we went into the Market and had some lunch, mainly standing around. Then we walked up the roads to Blackheath and turned into Greenwich park. We looked at the deer and stopped for a cup of tea. We then walked down the hill, after stopping to take a group photo at the observatory, to the Thames ferry. We took that back to Westminser Pier, from where we walked to the pub for a meal. Then it was back to Victoria Station and the train to Shoreham. I was home just before nine.</p>
