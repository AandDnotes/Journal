        <h1>Saturday 18th October</h1>
        <p>After we bught a few things in the Coop, including a newspaper, Angela went to the library and I came home. I then emailed Patrick to tell him about the fuel sender and trays to catch oil drips.</p>
        <p>I then did the weekly accounts and updated interest rates, followed by 'fixing' my revised Trips home page and uploading it.</p>
        <p>I had expected to remove the TC's spare wheel carrier again so as to get at the fuel sender. However, although my fingers smelt of petrol, they were not wet. So I decided to leave it another day.</p>
        <p>I looked at the ISA video on 'open automation', where Andre Babineau was interviewed. I didn't recognise him! It wasn't that informative, so I deleted the links to the rest.</p>
