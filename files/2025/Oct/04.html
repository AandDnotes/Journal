        <h1>Saturday 4th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Eastbourne early this morning, but was home just nefore four. So I did our usual walk to the High Street to get a newspaper and then did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After coffe I painted the sender unit and the piece of tank below it. Apart from reading some of the paper, I did the monthly accounts, which are distored a bit by Patrick's money for the TC.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Victoria and during the day I updated the OS on both the iMac and the MacBook.</p>
