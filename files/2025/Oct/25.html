        <h1>Saturday 25th October</h1>
        <p>Quite a sunny, but cold day. As usual on a Saturday we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then I went in to the garage and painted the base of the mail box, along with the outer edge of the front panel.</p>
        <p>We could get some free electricity today, so Angela put the washing on and we cleaned the oven between midday and three.</p>
        <p>We spent quite a bit of the afternoon talking with Victoria. They should take posession of their new house next weekend.</p>
