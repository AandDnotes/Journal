        <h1>Wednesday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>The day after the TC was driven away (on a trailer). I posted a photo of the TC on Patrick's trailer on to the Google Photos web site. While Angela went walking with her friends I walked to the Post Office to send my letter to the DVLA. Then I phoned the insurance broker to cancel the insurance on the TC. We will get a small refund. I also emailed the MG Octagon Car Club, asking them to remove my 'for sale' entry.</p>
        <p>I updated the History page of the TC's web site to note the sale to Patrick.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked down down to the High Street to get some stamps and buy some food. Tomorrow's weather is forecast to be stormy. We normally do our weekly shop on Thursdays, but decided to get what we need from the village and batton down the hatches tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I added more to my article about selling the TC.</p>
