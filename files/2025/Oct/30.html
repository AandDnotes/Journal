        <h1>Thursday 30th October</h1>
        <p>Our weekly grocery shopping trip was slightly different this morning. We went to Lidl in Shoreham and then on to M&amp;S for coffee and to buy a couple of things.</p>
        <p>After lunch I replied to Patrick R about why I'd removed the Tomkins kit and then started to work on Angela's bike. I oiled things and got the gears working. The bike now just needs cleaning. When I've done the same to my bike we will decide whether to keep and use the bikes or sell them.</p>
