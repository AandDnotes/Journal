        <h1>Tuesday 29th October</h1>
        <p>Today was as wet as yesterday was sunny. Nevertheless Angela went walking with her friends, although they only walked to Truffle in the High Strret. However, I stayed in the dry. I collected together our set of regular donations in preparation for modifying them.</p>
        <p>I then completed the report of my talk on SMRs for the RCEA newsletter and added a report on our visit to Shoreham power station. Then I did a little research on MGBs.</p>
        <p>It stopped raining at about four.</p>
