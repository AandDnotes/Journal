        <h1>Tuesday 28th October</h1>
        <p>It was sunny from dawn to dusk, although a little breezy. While Angela went to the High Street I posted a photo of Greenwhich Obseervatory and then reassembled the mail box and screwed it back on the wall by the front door.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a long walk (one and a half hours) to see the new White Bridge. To our surprise it was open, so we walked over it and back again.</p>
