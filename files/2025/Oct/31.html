        <h1>Friday 31st October</h1>
        <p>Halloween, the last day of October. We spent the morning inside. I replied to Patrick, who said that the ammeter on TC4985 was not going positive when being driven. Then I emailed Milestone Classics to ask if we could see the green MGB that they have. Then I modified our regular savings to the grandchildren, deleted the direct debit to Brighton and asked the air ambulance to change their direct debit from quarterly to monthly and for an increased amount.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon I went into the garage and lubricated everything on my bike. We now just need to clean them.</p>
