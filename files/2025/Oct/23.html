        <h1>Thursday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>We stayed inside all day, even though it was dry for some of the day. I bought rail tickets and parking for Monday's trip to London and completed my article about selling the TC. It seems that Roger didn't receive my last two articles (I sent them to an old email address)! I also created the html version of the article and added it to the TC's website.</p>
        <p>I received some photos from Patrick showing his garage, with the TC inside. Later he asked a couple of questions; one about the black rod in the tonneau area and the other about the starting process.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended an IET volunteer's workshop about Local Networks.</p>
