        <h1>Friday 10th October</h1>
        <p>It was a grey day, but stayed dry. We started by driving to the recycling centre in Shoreham to empty the back of the Panda. We then went on to Lidl to buy food for Monday's lunch club. Then it was off to Range in East Worthing to buy a few small things for a friend's 'Christmas boxes' and to have coffee. We dropped off the lunch club food (some frozen) at the church and were home in time for lunch. Luckilly the window cleaner had only just started when we arrived and so I was able to get him to clean the facia around the stairwell dorma (although it was quite expensive).</p>
        <p>It seems that the IET's Adestra system is about to be piloted, using some new log-in method requiring a physical device. I was asked to be one of the pilot group.</p>
        <p>Patrick had emailed about the chassis number stamped on the front leg of the chassis. He said that he needed a photo of it for the Dutch equivalent of an MoT. I suspect that his TC friend said that he should check that it matched the V5C. I had never checked it since, like the rest of the chassis, it has been painted. So I removed the paint and photographed it. I now need to paint it again!</p>
        <p>I also refitted the spare wheel carrier and the wheel. My atteempt to stop the fuel sender leaking seems to have worked.</p>
