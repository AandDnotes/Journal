        <h1>Sunday 12th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I spent the morning doing things for my talk on Tuesday. I charged batteries in everything, set up the MacBook with the TV and worked out how to handle the number classifier app. I then went through the slides, trying to work out what I am going to say. I will need at least one more run through.</p>
        <p>Later I added my write-up of our Norfolk trip to our web site. Unfortunately the background image on the home page is too short! So I need to sort that out.</p>
        <p>Patrick emailed to ask for a copy of the last MoT test certificate. I sent a scanned image and explained what I had done about the advisories.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. They had been busy over the past week, including having their car fixed.</p>
