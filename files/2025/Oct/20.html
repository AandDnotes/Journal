        <h1>Monday 20th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went to her Monday club, getting very wet on the way there and on the way home. She then went out again to post a birthday card to Alan.</p>
        <p>Alan called to say that, two weeks ago, he had a mild stroke! He said that the symptoms on his left side have recovered, but he is on blood thinners and has an appointment with a consultant in November. For the moment he is not allowed to drive or play bowls.</p>
        <p>I uploaded the video of my AI/ML talk to youTube. I also created a base RCEA December newsletter. Later I updated my 'important' web pages.</p>
