        <h1>Friday 24th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers and at midday I went to the High Street to have my hair cut.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela cut the grass, I took the mail box off the wall, removed the lock and front panel and cleaned up the many rust spot, both inside and out. Then, after cleaning it with some white sirit, I put black Hammerite on the patches on the inside.</p>
