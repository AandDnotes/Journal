        <h1>Tuesday 7th October</h1>
        <p>My first achievement was to get a response from Julie Weeds at UoS giving a name of someone who will give IET Sussex a talk on AI. I'm promised some details before my talk next Tuesday. Then I looked at how I get to the start of the Wanderers run tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I spent some time using up the remaining wax polish on the TC. I only had enough to do the top of the bonnet and the front wings. However, I noticed that some petrol had leaked from the fuel sender and disolved the point beneath it. So I removed the spare wheel holder, tightened the electrical connection terminal (which is where I think the fuel was leaking) and repainted the whole area.</p>
        <p>We agreed on dates and Eurostar times for a trip to the Netherlands over Christmas. Later I sent the proposed dates to Paul. I also started running through my talk on AI, modifying the slides or adding notes as I went. To my surprise, there is an RCEA talk that afternoon on AI in process control!</p>
