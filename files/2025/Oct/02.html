        <h1>Thursday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday we started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly grocery shop. Then, also as usual, we went on to Findon Vale for coffee. We also bought an outside tap insulator.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went down to the Health Centre for our Covid and flu jabs (one in each arm). There was a bit of a queue, but it didn't take long.</p>
        <p>The weather forecast for the next couple of days is wet and windy, so later I removed the spare wheel to look at the leaking fuel sender unit. I then lowered the car to the ground and rolled it forward a bit. I will need to remove the spare wheel carrier to gain access, but I can do it even if it rains.</p>
