        <h1>Sunday 5th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I went into the garage and cleaned and waxed the TC's fuel tank. Then I cleaned and refitted the spare wheel carrier before cleaning the spare wheel and putting it on the carrier.</p>
        <p>Later I cleaned the fuel pump points (even though the pump worked when I turned on the ignition) and checked the differential oil level. I also checked that the side lights and head lights all worked.</p>
        <p>We talked with Paul before they all went to a theatre in Amsterdam to a concert. Krista initially thought that it was on Saturday, so Rowan is going to have a late night before school.</p>
        <p>I took apart David's cassette player and fitted the new belts. I now just need to get it all back together!</p>
