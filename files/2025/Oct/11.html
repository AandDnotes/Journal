        <h1>Saturday 11th October</h1>
        <p>Following our usual walk to the High Street I painted over the area on the TC's chassis where the number is. Then I replaced the insulation on the pipe to the outside tap.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I did the weekly accounts and reconciled my spreadsheet against the bank statement.</p>
        <p>Then, after lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. It was busy at first, but then quietened down towards the end. I gave David F-B's donation and fixed an electric screwdriver. But, having got a blood pressure monitor to work, its screen did not work properly.</p>
