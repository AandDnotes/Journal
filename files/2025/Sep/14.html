        <h1>Sunday 14th September</h1>
        <p>We left the B&amp;B at Holt just after ten, saying goodbye to Kate and Dick, who were still having their breakfast. We followed the same route that we had taken on Thursday, but in reverse and again planned to stop at Hatfield Forest for some cake. Although we did, it took a little longer than expected, since I missed the turn off the M11 and we had to make a bit of a detour.</p>
        <p>We finally arrived home, in the rain, at four o'clock. After turning on thee house (luckily the broadband was still working) we spoke with Paul. Then Angela went down to the Coop (in the rain) to get some things for dinner.</p>
