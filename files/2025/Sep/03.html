        <h1>Wednesday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Angela went off with her walking group. They managed to stay dry, in spite of the heavy showers. I started the day by putting together information on the first two IET Sussex talks and sending it to Sam and a few others. It's a pity that she is out today.</p>
        <p>My next task was to import the GPX file of the SDR route into Kurviger. It worked very well, so I started a 7-day free trial. However, I chose the wrong version, one that didn't provide audio navigation! It hen wouldn't let me change it. So I cancelled the subscription, but I still couldn't change it. In the end I deleted my account and created a new account (with the same details). Then imported the GPX file again. I also created a route to Chichester Theatre and tested the app during the evening. It seems to work.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunch-time and took some filled rolls with us to Chichester. We had trouble finding a parking machine that worked and would take a card. However, one machine did work and we ate our rolls in the car before going into the theatre. It was an entertaining musical, if a bit predictable.</p>
