        <h1>Thursday 4th September</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday, we went off to do the weekly supermarket shop, although today we did two shops, one for us and one for the lunch club. We managed to get everything apart from bread rolls in Lidl, so we then went off to Findon Vale for coffee. Angela also bought some new slippers, since the sole of one of hers had broken.</p>
        <p>I received an email from my cousin Antony about our other cousin Martin. It seems that Martin has MND and is currently confined to a chair. I emailed Martin, giving him a brief summary of our Canada/US trip and replied to Tony.</p>
        <p>I also did a little more to my Canada trip web pages.</p>
