        <h1>Sunday 28th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I started by finishing the monthly accounts (apart from the the two accounts that I can't currently access). I then updated the purchase agreement that Patrick had sent. He later tried a FaceTime call while I was in the garage. It didn't work, since the wi-fi doesn't quite reach that far. So I came indoors and called him back. He needed my bank details, since he wants to transfer the money before he comes over. I gave him these details and sent an email saying that if, for some reason, he does not buy the car after inspecting it, then I will return the money.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning putting the car up on axle stands so that I can clean up the underside. Just as I'd finished doing this, Norman W called to drop off the IET's video camera.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. We sort of agreed that we will visit over Christmas.</p>
