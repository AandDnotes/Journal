        <h1>Wednesday 10th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early with her walking group wearing a full set of waterproofs. They walked down to Botolphs and back to the Hub. I was collected by Davis F-B and we drove off to Keymer to meet up with other members of the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee we followed the 25-mile route, which was good, returning to the Thatched Inn for lunch. Again I made a mistake in my meal selection. The chicken ceaser salad was not the best.</p>
        <p>David and I left fairly early, encountering some torrential rain on the way.</p>
        <p>After dinner I ran the PEI Group meeting, which went on and on!</p>
