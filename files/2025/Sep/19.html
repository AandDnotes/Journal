        <h1>Friday 19th September</h1>
        <p>We started with a walk to the surgery so that I could try to get an appointment to see a doctor about the spot on my nose. They phoned me later to make an appointment for Wednesday. Angela also went to the butchers.</p>
        <p>We then went off to the Windmill pub in Littleworth for the WSMGOC pub lunch. There were 20 people there, along with a number of MGs, but not the TC. Afterwards we went on to Camelia Botner to have (expensive) coffee and buy som compost and more plants.</p>
        <p>A little later I had text messages from both BT and Openreach, saying that an engineer needs to call (again). But they are not coming until next Tuesday, between 8am and 1pm! Then I completed my web page on our Norfolk trip.</p>
