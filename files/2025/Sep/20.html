        <h1>Saturday 20th September</h1>
        <p>This morning we walked down to the High Street to buy a few things and also took the MacBook and iPad with us so that we could use the library wi-fi. However, we were too early for the library (it didn't open until ten), so we brought the shopping home and then walked down to the library. We connected both devices to the wi-fi, but, being unsecured, Apple mail wouldn't connect to the servers. So I sent WhatsApp messages to Victoria, Paul, Mike W and Joanne L. The iPad was out of power, so Angela came home and I checked my email via the browser. Luckily there was nothing too important.</p>
        <p>Angela spent time in the garden, but, apart from entering the week's visa slips into my accounts spreadsheet, most of my time was spent reading the paper.</p>
