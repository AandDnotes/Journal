        <h1>Monday 29th September</h1>
        <p>I noticed yesterday evening that the drinks cabinet had a small gap at one end between it and the wall. So I emptied it and took it off the wall. Then this morning, while Angela went to her Monday Club, I removed the baton and decided to put it back in its lower position, using the old holes. I had to put some filler around one wall plug, which needs to dry before I can screw the baton back on the wall.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage and cleaned the front underside of the TC, including under the front wings. I also greased the U/Js on the prop-shaft.</p>
        <p>I also researched what you need to send the DVLA when you sell a cor to someone who lives in Europe. I discovered that I can give Patrick the V5C, but I have to send the export section to the DVLA along with a letter giving Patrick's name and address.</p>
