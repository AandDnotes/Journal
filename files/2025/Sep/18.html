        <h1>Thursday 18th September</h1>
        <p>Our usual day for doing the weekly grocery shopping day. So we went off to Lyons Farm, to Lidl, Sainsbury's and Boots before we went on to Findon Vale. Angela bought some plants for the hanging baskets.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela worked on those hanging baskets and I started putting together my web page on our trip to Norfolk.</p>
        <p>Of course, we still had no internet connection.</p>
