        <h1>Tuesday 167th September</h1>
        <p>To our surprise the Virgin broadband was still working. So we could view emails and I went through my slides for the talk I was due to give to the RCEA after lunch. However, the broadband connection stopped at about 11 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street and I added a couple of 'facts' to my slide notes.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I collected Peter W and drove to Field Place. After a short AGM I gave my talk on Small Modular Reactors. I was glad that I'd put all my cables and adapters in my bag (although I forgot to pack the pointer/slide changer), since the Field Place supplied cable kept breaking the communications to the projector. Even with my cable the slide background colour was white, with black titles, rather than burgundy titles on a cream background.</p>
        <p>Although I took a little longer than planned to give the talk, everyone seemed to enjoy it. So we were a little late home.</p>
