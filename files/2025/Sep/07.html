        <h1>Sunday 7th September</h1>
        <p>A long and tiring day during which I drove the TC 107 miles, mainly in the sunshine. I started by driving to the Southdowns Gliding Club ground for eight o'clock to start marshalling. Nearly 200 cars, almost all MGs came in to the field. I then left at around 10:30. I skipped the first loop around to Ashington and through Wiston and drove directly to Bramber after stopping to top up the petrol. Unfortunately, having deviated from the Kurviger route, it did not then start the audio description when I re-joined the route. In any case, it was difficult to hear the directions, even using ear buds, due to the wind noise.</p>
        <p>However I caught up with some other MGs and so followed them, keeping an eye on the route on the phone. This ploy worked quite well until the two cars ai was following reached Alfriston. They both turned into (different) car parks and I realised that they had missed a turn. I drove through Alfriston, stoped to look at the route, drove back through Alfriston and made the correct turn. By this time I'd lost the other cars, so I had to follow the map.</p>
        <p>I arrived at the Western Lawns in Eastbourne at 12:45. However, a few minutes later my phone went dead. The Kuviger app had drained the battery. Between Chris Rickard's power bank and mine I was able to charge it and phone Angela to say I'd arrived.</p>
        <p>After lunch (which I'd taken with me) and talking to a lot of people I left at around 3:45. I took the A259 along the coast, getting home at 4:15.</p>
        <p>The TC started well, but soon developed a hesitation when accelerating. It also seemed to lack power.</p>
        <p>When I got home we spoke with Paul.</p>
