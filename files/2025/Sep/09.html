        <h1>Tuesday 9th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Storrington this morning to bank cash from the lunch club. Meanwhile, I paid the road tax on the Panda and booked our trips across the Dartford Crossing.</p>
        <p>We also agreed the route we will take on Thursday to Holt, including where we will stop for lunch. I then printed details of the route.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the kitchen garden grass with the new mower and put the broken cordless mower back together. I also started adding the SDR to my list of outings on the Mg's web site.</p>
        <p>After dinner we went to Felicity and John's. It turned out that it was John's 80th birthday.</p>
