        <h1>Wednesday 24th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her friends, I walked to the health centre for my appointment with Dr Jain about the spot on my nose. She looked at it through a magnifying glass and decided it was a squamous carcinova. So she has referred me to Dermatology at Southlands.</p>
        <p>I then spent some time messaging BT about the delay in connecting us. For some reason I had to 'talk' with their technicians to get the fault closed. Then we will get automatic compensation, which will be more than our month's bill.</p>
        <p>I then seemed to spend the rest of the day trying to sort out the problem with my number classification app. I installed the latest version of Python 3, but I had lots of problems.</p>
