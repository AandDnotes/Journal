        <h1>Monday 1st September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the library and to her Monday Club (and got wet in the process), I obtained a Zoom link from Colin for next week's PEI Group meeting and agreed a time to take the IET's video camera to Norman W. Unfortunately, the new battery only left China two days ago!</p>
        <p>Most of the rest of the day was spent working on my Canada/US trip web pages. Just Vancouver to do now.</p>
