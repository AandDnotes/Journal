        <h1>Thursday 11th September</h1>
        <p>We set of at 9:30 in the rain, heading for Holt in Norfolk. Luckily the rain stopped as we entered Kent, although we had a few spots near Thakeham.</p>
        <p>We stopped at the half-way point (in miles) at Hatfield Forest for some lunch and then arrived at the B&amp;B just after three. Kate and Dick arrived half an hour later, complete with a bottle of Proseco!</p>
        <p>After a long chat we went off to look at Holt and then to a pub where Kate had booked a table. However, a number of dishes were off the menu, which was smaller than the one online. This upset Kate and so we went to another pub and had quite a good, but ordinary meal.</p>
