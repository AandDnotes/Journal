        <h1>Tuesday 30th September</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela walked down to the High Street to do a little groceries shopping, I screwed the drinks cabinet baton on the wall. It took a while to get the wall flat enough, but Angela helped me lift the cabinet on to the baton. I then put everything back into it.</p>
        <p>I then tried logging in to my OakNorth and Shawbrook accounts. I still couldn't get into either, so I sent an email to the former to reset my password (which I did later), but I had to phone the latter and there was a ten minute queue, so I gave up. When I tried later, they were closed!</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I was picked up by Peter W and taken to Shoreham Power Station. A dozen of our RCEA members had an interesting visit. I was home just before five.</p>
