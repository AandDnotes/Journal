        <h1>Monday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>A cool, but sunny day. And quite a busy one.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday Club, I was talking to a Dutchman who is interested in my TC. He phoned, but the phone was upstairs and I missed the call. I thought it might be Paul, even though it was not his number, so I phoned back. Patrick asked a number of questions and asked if I would send him a video of the car running, plus a collection of photos about the seats and engine compartment. Later he texted to ask if there was any rust.</p>
        <p>I started walking to The Hub to use their wi-fi, but then realised that I'd forgotten to pick up my wallet. So I walked back home and then took the Panda. Luckily their wi-fi allowed mail to work and I deleted lots. Then, apart from drinking coffee, I sent an email to Patrick before driving home.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC for a run to warm the engine and then took the requested video and photos. Then I pruned the bush on the corner of the drive with the hedge-cutter.</p>
        <p>Later I drafted a web page to view the photos and the video.</p>
