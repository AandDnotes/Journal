        <h1>Tuesday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. And quite a wet day. I walked, in the pouring rain, to the barbers in the High Street. Angela was going to walk to the butchers at the same time, but waited for the rain to ease. So I had my hair cut and walked back in the rain. The bottom of my trousers are still wet!</p>
        <p>I tried to add a reduced-size video to my Vancouver page. But it doesn't work!</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I drove to Norman W's house in East Grinstead, in the rain. Since I can't get to the first talk in Crawley, I handed over the video camera and microphones, with a little bit of explanation. Getting there and back, along with explanation and drinking tea, took most of the afternoon.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the IET Sussex committee meeting. It was as shambolic as usual. Advertising for the upcoming talks has been minimal and the numbers registered show it. So I took a couple of actions.</p>
