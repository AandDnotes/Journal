        <h1>Monday 15th September</h1>
        <p>Today was mainly about switching broadband from Virgin Media to BT. I started by walking to the Post Office to collect the BT router. A little later I had a message to say that we were connected, but the router would not connect. So I phoned the help line, who eventually said that the message was sent too early and that it should be connected before the end of the day.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon another message said that everything was ready, but the still the router would not connect. So I phoned again. This time they booked an engineer to call on Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>Luckily the Virgin connection still worked for the day, although the phone stopped working during the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, Angela went to her Monday Club and I did the 'weekly' accounts. Later I ticked off the entries on the bank statement.</p>
        <p>Later we went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. We had a meal there (half portions).</p>
