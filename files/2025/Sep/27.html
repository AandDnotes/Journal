        <h1>Saturday 27th September</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper.</p>
        <p>I phoned Coventry Building Society and found that a transfer into my account would take two days! so I decided to use one of our Barclays accounts for which I can provide an IBAN code. I then spent quite a long time updating the weekly accounts and filling in the monthly account for the beginning of September (even though it is now near the end of the month). I had problems with two of the accounts, one of my own making (I used the wrong password) and one web site that just won't work.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They are now the owner of a house with a tenant (until the end of October).</p>
