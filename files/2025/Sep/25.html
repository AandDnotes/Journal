        <h1>Thursday 25th September</h1>
        <p>Straight after breakfast I tested my AI app again. All seemed to be well.</p>
        <p>Then we started, as usual on a Thursday, by driving to Lyons Farm to do the weekly groceries shop in Lidl and Sainsbury's. We then went on to Findon Vale for coffee and a look around.</p>
        <p>I transferred Â£100 into Victoria's Halifax account for Juniper's birthday and emailed Victoria. I also investigated trying to obtain a transcript of the PEI Group meeting video recording. I couldn't find out how to do it, so emailed Colin C to ask him to obtain one.</p>
        <p>I found a supplier of drive belts for David F-B's cassette player and ordered them. I also updated my TC photos folder on Github so that the web page uses .jpg files rather than .HEIC files. I now just need to delete the .HEIC files to save space.</p>
