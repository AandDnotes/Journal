        <h1>Tuesday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>A momentous day. Our internet connection was made this morning. The Openreach 'engineer' (actually a Kelly Communications man) arrived at 11 o'clock. He plugged a couple of devices into our socket and then said he would go to the green box across the road. Actually he drove off, we assume to the exchange and after a while the hub showed a steady blue light. It seems that something was not connected! We checked that the phone worked before he left.</p>
        <p>So we both checked and cleared our email and then I uploaded files for my set of photos of the TC for Patrick R. Later, Paul checked it and suggested that I replace the HEIC files with jpg versions. However, Patrick was able to view them.</p>
        <p>The evening started with a CC-UK meeting. It was run by the new IET manager for communities (I think), who was obviously into workshop tools, but didn't seem to know what LNs or the CC-UK do. It was a bit of a waste of time.</p>
