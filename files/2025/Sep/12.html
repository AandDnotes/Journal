        <h1>Friday 12th September</h1>
        <p>We started by Kate driving us to Blickling Hall, a National Trust estate 20 minutes from where we are staying. Kate had intended that we join a group for an outline of the house and estate, but, not only would we have been too late, it was not being run today. So Kate and Dick toured the grounds, including the walled garden and we went into the house. We had arranged that I would call Kate when we came out, but there was no signal! Luckily we saw Dick, on his scooter, drive past a hole in the wall of the walled garden.</p>
        <p>After coffee and a scone we went on to the Bure Valley Railway, a narrow gauge railway, run by enthusiasts for the nine miles from Aylsham to Wroxam. It runs on a 15-inch gauge track, built on the disused trackbed of the former East Norfolk Railway, which originally opened in 1880 and closed in 1982. It was a good day out.</p>
        <p>Later we went to the Red Hart pub about five minutes drive from our B&amp;B.</p>
