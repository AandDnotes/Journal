        <h1>Sunday 21st September</h1>
        <p>A dry and mainly sunny day. Angela went off to church and I 'played' with the TC. I fixed a piece of masking tape to the bracket beneath the distributor and made a pencil mark that crossed over from the base of the distributor on to the distributor. Then I sorted out the spanners that would free the distributor so that I could rotate it and then took it for a run to warm the engine. I went down Clays Hill, along the bypass and back trough the High Street, twice. When I got back, I loosened the distributor and rotated it while the engine was idling so as to get the highest revs. This turned out to be two or three degrees retardation. I then drove the car around the same loop and then up the Bostal Road and back down Newham Lane. I chose this so as to have a hill to climb. I drove a total of 13 miles and the TC performed well, although at times I couldn't tell if the engine was stuttering due to the bumps in the road.</p>
        <p>At one point I removed the dipstick so as to get easier access and then started the engine with the dipstick still out. Oil sputtered out of the hole on to the wing! Although I cleaned it up, I went out after lunch to put a little wax on that area of the wing and to cover the car.</p>
        <p>Angela cut the grass with the new mower (after I had shown her how to move the handle from its folded position). I cut up the mower's cardboard box (keeping two long pieces) and then sharpened the kitchen knives from the block.</p>
