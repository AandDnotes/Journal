        <h1>Saturday 6th September</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Since I have an early start tomorrow, we had a shower this morning before walking down to the High Street. Angela also had to buy a few more things for the Lunch Club.</p>
        <p>I checked the TC tyres and cleaned the plugs. I also checked that the fuel pump would start. Then I dismantled more of the lawn mower. I had hoped to find the belt 'gummed up', but it was clean and when I removed the belt, both the motor spindle and the blade drive rotated freely. So I just put some lubricant on the spindles and put it back together. I also checked the voltage on the two batteries that I was using. Both were fine. So the problem is either the motor of the electronic assembly.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. The surveyor says that the house on which they've made an offer has not been maintained for years and so there is lot that needs doing. The only thing that had been maintained was the pool. So they are now waiting for estimates from builders before deciding what to do.</p>
        <p>Since there seems little chance of getting the lawn mower working, we decided to go and buy a new one, but a corded one. So we went off to B&amp;Q. We had seen a Bosch mower on-line, but liked the look of a McAlister mower that was much cheaper. So we bought it and I assembled it when we got home.</p>
