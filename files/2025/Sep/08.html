        <h1>Monday 8th September</h1>
        <p>It was a quieter day for me, but Angela had a busy day. She left early to go to the church to start preparing for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>I uploaded my web pages on our trip to Canada and the US. I went to Phylis's to help take her puddings to the church. Then we had lunch.</p>
        <p>Later I tried out the new mower on the grass in the walled and front gardens.</p>
