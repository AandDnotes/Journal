        <h1>Saturday 13th September</h1>
        <p>We had a slightly later start today, since the house at the NT property we were visiting (Felbrigg Hall) didn't open until midday. So we looked at photos over breakfast and then set off. Kate and Dick went off to the walled garden, while we went round the house. We met up and spent a while in the cafe. It just started to rain as we approached the car and was very heavy.</p>
        <p>From there we went on to another NT property, Sheringham Park. Luckily it had stopped raining by then. Dick was able to drive his scooter along a made-up path and so we walked through the woods for a while. Then we went on (in the rain) to Blakely, where Kate had booked a table in a restaurant. We waited for the rain to stop and then had a good meal.</p>
