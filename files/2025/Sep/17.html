        <h1>Wednesday 17th September</h1>
        <p>The weather was still windy and wet and we still had no internet. Angela went walking as usual, although they didn't walk far. She wasn't able to call Felicity on either of our mobiles, due to a poor signal. The phones usually use wi-fi for calls.</p>
        <p>The BT 'engineer' arrived at 10:30. He tested the line and said it was fine. He also swapped the hub, but is made no difference. He concluded that there was a fault at the exchange, which meant that he had to pass the problem to Openreach. A little later they texted to say that they had found a fault, but it would be up to two working days before it was fixed!</p>
        <p>I took David F-B's cassette player apart and 'fiddled' with the belts (there are at least three) and afterwards the player worked. I suspect that the belts have stretched and need replacing. Of course, I can't currently find someone who supplies them. I also dismantled the Arduino that I'd used for the remote control Lego car.</p>
