        <h1>Friday 5th September</h1>
        <p>I was up early (6:30), which was earlier than needed, so that I could take the Panda to Simms at 8:30 for a service and MoT test. I got a call to say that it was done at about 3:30 and walked down to collect it.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street and then worked in the garden. I followed the SDR route on Google Maps using the route on Kurviger. I also set the option so that it will not try to re-route if I deviate from the route. I might skip the initial part of the route and drive directly to Bramber.</p>
        <p>I finally completed my web pages describing our Canada/US trip. I now need to upload the files to Github.</p>
        <p>Whilst working in the garden Angela found that the mower would not start. So I cleaned the contacts, which made no difference, and started dismantling it.</p>
