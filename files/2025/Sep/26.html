        <h1>Friday 26th September</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Grey, overcast and quite cool. Angela went off early to set up for the coffee morning. I went down a little later and helped finish the setting up. Unfortunately, between ten and 12, there were only half a dozen visitors. Far fewer than previous years.</p>
        <p>A little later Patrick Roosen and his wife FaceTimed. For some reason it connected to my phone and not to the iMac or MacBook. However, we agreed on a price for the TC and they plan to come over on October 21st staying the night somewhere locally. They will bring a trailer and return the following day. Later he sent the document that he needs to complete for the import of the car.</p>
