        <h1>Monday 13th January</h1>
        <p>When I got up,Angela was cutting up chicken breast! She then went off at about nine to start cooking for the lunch club. I spent some time searching for photos of the grandchildren to add to my web site. Then I went to Phylis's to help her carry the dessert (crumble) to the church kitchen. About eight people had pulled out, so there were fewer than usual.</p>
        <p>We were home by 3:30 after clearing up. Then I went to the WSMGOC meeting later in the evening. I sat with Richard and Sue.</p>
