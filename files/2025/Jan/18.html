        <h1>Saturday 18th January</h1>
        <p>The dull, grey, cold, but calm days continued. As usual on a Saturday morning, we walked to the High Street to buy a few things. I then did the weekly accounts and put together a spreadsheet of a possible itinerary for a trip to Ontario and on to Vancouver via the Rocky Mountaineer. Angela spent the morning making marmalade, although not enough to last us until next year.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria et al. They now have all their belongings and seem to be making progress. Although they've had snow, it had now cleared. Claudia and Gene are visiting them at Easter and then at the beginning of the school summer holidays. So we could agree the dates for us to visit them. Yesterday I emailed the operators of the Rocky Mountaineer to see if we could extend the stay in Vancouver. The replied, asking for our details, so I sent them our details, requesting just one extra night in Vancouver. Later, following Victoria's suggestion, I looked at the possibility of flying to Buffalo (in the US) or flying to Calgary from there, since it would be easier to get to Beamsville. However, there are no direct flights from Gatwick or from Buffalo to Calgary.</p>
