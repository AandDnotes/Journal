        <h1>Friday 31st January</h1>
        <p>A very wet morning was spent trying to get access to the files that I backed up on the old laptop. The Windows system spent a very long time updating itself. Then it couldn't identify the different partitions and couldn't access the files in the 'data' partition.</p>
        <p>Just before 11:30 we set off to Warnham, near Horsham, to have lunch with members of the WSMGOC. Luckily the rain had more or less stopped by then. My chicken curry was a bit disappointing, but it was a good outing. We were home at around 2:30.</p>
        <p>Then it was back to trying to sort out backups. The latest linux system would not show the data partition, but, luckily, a previous version would. So I backed up the remaining files, including an export of the Photos library. Now I just need to map out the partitions and delete those that I don't want to remain on the laptop when I give it away.</p>
