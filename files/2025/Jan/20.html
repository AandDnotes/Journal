        <h1>Monday 20th January</h1>
        <p>Another cold, calm and mainly grey day. Angela went to her Monday club and I started by replying to the IET member who said he would not go to talks at Falmer on principle. Steve West asked me to do so. Then I put estimates of the various taxi journeys into my spreadsheet for our trip to Canada. I also had to hung out the washing. It was very cold.</p>
        <p>Whilst doing these things I also charged the batteries for the video camera and microphones and deleted previous recordings.</p>
        <p>After lunch I had a Teams talk with Joanne about the Swindon LN's wish to have a stand at RIAT 2025. Later, Joanne sent them an email saying that the money for this event would be half what they requested. Then later I attended a CC-UK meeting, which was mainly taken up preparing the next Roadshow on the work of LNs Treasurers.</p>
