        <h1>Wednesday 8th January</h1>
        <p>A cold, dry morning and then a wet afternoon, with a little snow. Luckily Angela and her walking group stayed dry for their (shortish) walk and long coffee break.</p>
        <p>I created my Adestra email and submitted it for approval. Then I set up a new regular savings account, along with the standing order to feed it, for me. After lunch I did the same for Angela, since both our existing accounts close later this month. I also set the maturity options on a couple of bonds and downloaded an M&amp;S Â£10 voucher given to me after completing a questionnaire.</p>
        <p>Angela did a lot of cooking later in the afternoon and I 'dismantled' the jigsaw. This meant that we were able to have dinner in the dining room.</p>
