        <h1>Tuesday 21st January</h1>
        <p>For me it was a busy morning, a quiet afternoon and a busy evening. Angela, of course, was busy all day.</p>
        <p>I sent an email about parking to those who had registered for the evening's talk and then spent the rest of the morning exploring options for our trip to Canada, since we received the quote from Rocky Mountaineer. After lunch I sent some comments on the CC-UK Roadshow slides to Sach and then worked through my proposed timetable for our trip with Angela. Angela walked to the High Street, cooked our main meal and then later walked to the library.</p>
        <p>At 6:45 I drove to Falmer for the IET talk, paying for my parking. The talk was more interesting than I thought it would be, but we only had a dozen attendees. I don't know if this was due to the January effect or to the need to pay for parking.</p>
