        <h1>Wednesday 15th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to join her walking friends, returning later to change shoes before going to Mama Mia in the High Street for their walking group lunch. I prepared the 'grandchildren' photos for my web site and replied to the Swindon LN about their budget.</p>
        <p>I also put the TC's battery on charge, downloaded the pdf version of the slides used by yesterday's RCEA speaker and started writing up my notes. Then I did some more research on a trip to Canada. Getting from Toronto to Beamsville looks problematic.</p>
