        <h1>Saturday 25th January</h1>
        <p>After yesterdays strong(ish) winds, today was calm, sunny and not too cold (about five degrees). As usual on a Saturday morning we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. We both tried out our new shoes, which seem fine.</p>
        <p>I then did the weekly accounts and closed the two accounts resulting from last year's regular savings. I will move the money (or at least some of it) into our Blue Saver account.</p>
        <p>Just as we were finishing lunch so Victoria messaged us. So we had quite a long chat before she got dressed. Brandon, apart from getting fed up with the snow, still seems to be bothered by the small size of his salary and the way that the establishment is run. However, Austin and Juniper seem to be coping well.</p>
