        <h1>Friday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Another grey, calm and cold day. I spent the morning writing up notes on Tuesday's RCEA talk. Later I sent it to Mike for review and comment. Meanwhile, Angela cooked seville oranges in preparation for making marmalade.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to a St Barnabas fundraising meeting and I worked on my 'grandchildren' web page. I also arranged or set up MS Teams meetings for next week.</p>
