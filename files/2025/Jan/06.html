        <h1>Monday 6th January</h1>
        <p>A very cold day, but a dry one. Angela went to her Monday Club, while I did some of the jigsaw, researched regular savings accounts and looked at the Swindon LN web site and use of Adestra.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we did some more jigsaw and then I went to the dentist. I'd had a call earlier to bring tomorrow's appointment forward. I refused having a cap and chose a simple filling.</p>
