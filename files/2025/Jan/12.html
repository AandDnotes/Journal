        <h1>Sunday 12th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I failed to find a circuit diagram for the satellite TV box, but took it apart. Power was getting to the 'on' button and many other places, but it would not turn on. I suspect the microprocessor, since it is really the only component that is stressed. So after lunch I put it back together and tried it on our TV with input from our dish. It didn't turn on.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They've unloaded five of their 'boxes' that arrived on Saturday and have two more arriving tomorrow. They employed a removal firm to help them unload the boxes. Brandon seemed to have a reasonable first week at his new job and Austin and Juniper started school on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Rowan was just going for a bath.</p>
