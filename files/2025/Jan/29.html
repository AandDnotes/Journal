        <h1>Wednesday 29th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Lancing Beach with her walking group this morning, walking to Broadwater for coffee and then back. Meanwhile, I forwarded the 'HackSussex' email to Steve and Ian, saying what I thought were our options, and then produced a start slide for Tuesday's IET Sussex talk. I sent that to Crawly College for integration into their system.</p>
        <p>Later I started sorting out the superfluous devices that we can try to recycle. So far I've not been able to find the old mobile phone! Then I resurrected our old MacBook and backed up the photos on the iMac.</p>
