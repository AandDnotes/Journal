        <h1>Wednesday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning with her walking group to Shoreham Beach. I sent our IET Network Manager details of the attendance at last night's talk and sent the Rocky Volunteer the information that they requested so as to book our trip.</p>
        <p>Having completed my 'grandchildren' web page I deleted the old version and uploaded the new one via GitHub. However, the update failed and I had to log into GitHub and re-run it.</p>
        <p>I spent more time reading guides on Canada and trying to find details of transport from Toronto airport to Beamsville, via Niagara Falls.</p>
        <p>After dinner I had a Teams call with Jason Crouch, Chair of the Wessex IMechE. He would like to see a combined database of events that all local PEIs could access to find events across the region.</p>
