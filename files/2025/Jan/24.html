        <h1>Friday 24th January</h1>
        <p>Another day of spending money. I started by working out the order and timing of the various payments we should use so as to keep the credit card to a reasonable level.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street I paid the deposit for our Rocky Mountaineer trip and then tried to buy the flights from Toronto to Calgary. However, firstly I couldn't include checked baggage on the Air Transat site. It seems that the flight is operated by Porter Airline and so Air Transat couldn't include the options. However, when I tried to book the flights through the Porter site, my credit card was rejected. It turned out that the site did not use a security method that mbna liked, so they wouldn't pay. Consequently I booked the flight through the Air Transat site (which used pounds), but with only carry-on luggage. It seems that we can pay for checked luggage at the airport.</p>
        <p>My credit card did, however, work for the bus between Calgary and Banff. I will buy insurance and one long-haul flight after the credit card direct debit has been paid.</p>
        <p>Later I ordered a new pan for the bread maker. Ours has started leaking and the paddle spindle was very stiff.</p>
