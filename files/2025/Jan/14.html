        <h1>Tuesday 14th January</h1>
        <p>It was a bright, dry, calm and sunny day. Angela went off to the High Street quite early and I created the medium and small size images of the grandchildren. I also started investigating the possibility of going on the Rocky Mountain Pioneer as part of a trip to Canada in the summer.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Field Place to the RCEA talk on the formation of the universe as revealed by the various space telescopes. Then after dinner I joined the Anglian Coast IET Local Network for their committee meeting.</p>
