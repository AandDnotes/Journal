        <h1>Friday 10th January</h1>
        <p>Another very cold day, but dry and calm. While Angela spent the morning doing housework, I completed the IET Sussex 'programme of events' for 2024/25 and uploaded it to the Sussex home page.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I completed my revised 'grandchildren' web page, using grids rather than absolute positioning. Now I can add photos for the past 12 years! Angela went to the Steyning Centre to play table tennis.</p>
