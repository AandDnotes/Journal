        <h1>Thursday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>Firstly I submitted my Adestra email and then we set off, still relatively early, in the rain, to go into Worthing to search for a new mattress. That only took us half an hour, so we went back to Morrisons (where we had parked) and did most of our weekly groceries shop. Then we went to Waitrose to have coffee and buy the things we had forgotten to buy in Morrisons.</p>
        <p>From there, we walked into the centre. Angela bought some shoes/boots and then I bought some walking shoes. I had to get size 12! It was still raining and I got quite wet when we stopped to buy petrol at Lyons Farm. We were home late for lunch.</p>
        <p>I spent some time investigating what our costs would be if we had to cancel or trip to Canada. Then I searched for travel insurance that gave greater cover for cancellation, without being too much more expensive.</p>
        <p>Yesterday I had emailed Mike and Dave about the lack of a speaker for our first talk in February. Mike asked if I could give my talk on fusion. So I modified my Adestra email (it hadn't yet been approved) and added the title and synopsis to Dave's spreadsheet.</p>
