        <h1>Sunday 26th January</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day. Angela went to church and got very wet on the way home. Then it rained on and off for the rest of the afternoon and evening. I spent the morning trying to fix my two beard trimmers. The battery trimmer just needed the battery contacts cleaned. Having taken the other trimmer apart (eventually) and cleaned it out, it worked! However, putting it back together proved difficult, with some bits of plastic braking off. But, finally getting it together, it works; although it does not line up properly and adjustments are stiff.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul et al.</p>
