        <h1>Thursday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>The weather was a little different to yesterday's; sunshine from dawn to dusk! However, it was quite cold. In fact there was frost on the roofs.</p>
        <p>After putting out some washing to dry, we walked to the library and then to the butchers, before having coffee in Victoria's Sponge. We then bought two cards, one to welcome Victoria et al to their new house (rented) and one for their wedding anniversary.</p>
        <p>I spent the afternoon doing the monthly accounts, the first of the year. However, one of Angela's savings accounts would not recognise her to log in. So I (Angela) sent the an email.</p>
        <p>We did also do a little more to the jigsaw.</p>
