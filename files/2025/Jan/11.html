        <h1>Saturday 11th January</h1>
        <p>The outside thermometer was indicating -3 degrees C this morning. However, it was calm and sunny. Later, it did reach the heady heights of zero.</p>
        <p>We walked to the High Street to get things for the lunch club and a few things for us, including a newspaper.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts and reconciling the bank statement against my spreadsheet. It all balanced!</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. We were very busy. I looked at an electric blanket, some dinosaur lights, a toaster and a satellite TV receiver, the latter of which I brought home.</p>
        <p>A message earlier from Victoria said that they were expecting their furniture to arrive today, so we may need to talk with them tomorrow.</p>
