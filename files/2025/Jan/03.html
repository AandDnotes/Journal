        <h1>Friday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>Another sunny, but very cold day. So we didn't go out until the evening.</p>
        <p>We spent some time working on the jigsaw and I started experimenting with reproducing my 'grandchildren' web page, using the html 'grid' facility.</p>
        <p>We were invited to Felicity and John's for 'drinks'. There were some people who we didn't know, including a couple who own a vineyard in West Chiltington. They brought along a bottle of their sparkling wine, which was very good.</p>
