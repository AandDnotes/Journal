        <h1>Day/date</h1>
        <p>We finished the jigsaw today. But first, Angela went to the High Street, while I looked up information about the Swindon LN in preparation for the evening's committee meeting.</p>
        <p>I paid the deposit for the WSMGOC Annual Dinner and started preparing information for an Adestra email, both details about parking at Falmer and details of the talks. But I now need to generate the email.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the Swindon LN committee meeting. They had an agenda, didn't follow it and no one was running the meeting. They are having trouble with using the Coreprint tool for generating a poster, although have modified what has been downloaded in Word. It also seems that their funding for their major event has been withdrawn, but the treasurer was not at the meeting, so no one really knew any details. They will arrange another specific meeting (with the treasurer) and invite me.</p>
