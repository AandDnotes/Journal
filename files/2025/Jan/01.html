        <h1>Wednesday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day; and it rained from dawn to dusk. So we didn't go out. After both getting up to use the loo at 6:30, I didn't manage to get back to sleep. So I felt tired all day, in spite of a short nap after lunch.</p>
        <p>We didn't do a lot apart from some of the jigsaw puzzle. We did, however, watch and listen to some of the New Year concert from Vienna.</p>
