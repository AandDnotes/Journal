        <h1>Sunday 19th January</h1>
        <p>Being Sunday, Angela started by going to church. I prepared a speaker certificate for Tuesday's talk and got out some gifts. We only have 21 people registered.</p>
        <p>Angela came home slightly earlier than usual to bake a cake to take back later in the day. I spent time looking at day-tours from Vancouver to see if the 'Rocky Mountaineer' optional extra price was reasonable. The half-day tour is cheaper from the people who actually run it.</p>
        <p>Paul et al had been into Goude, to the library (and to have coffee), so our chat with them was not until after our tea (we had our main meal at lunchtime).</p>
