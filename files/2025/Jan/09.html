        <h1>Thursday 9th January</h1>
        <p>Today's main task was to shop for Monday's lunch club and for our weekly groceries. We started by going to Morrisons to get condensed soup and frozen chicken. Then we went to Waitrose to have coffee and to buy a few things that we knew we couldn't get in Lidl. We finished at Lyons Farm for the main shop for both accounts.</p>
        <p>Since it was very cold, although calm, we decided to go there and back on the main roads rather than over the Bostal.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took the lunch club food down to the church kitchen. It was quite heavy. Then I read the CC-UK document (PowerPoint file) that Joanne had sent for comment. Later I sent my thoughts to the rest of the committee.</p>
