        <h1>Saturday 4th January</h1>
        <p>Another sunny, but cold day. We started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. Then I did the weekly accounts before we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. We again had problems with the iPad. It would not call! So we used the MacBook and I later updated the iPad OS, then deleted and reinstalled FaceTime. We will see how it performs tomorrow.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, in Canada. They are camping-out in their rented house in Beamsville. They have only done a temporary import for all their things, including the cars, and then make it permanent later. They also need to get Canadian driving licences before they can get car insurance. The necessary documents are in the post, which has been on strike and so now has a backlog!</p>
        <p>During the day we only managed to do a little to the jigsaw.</p>
