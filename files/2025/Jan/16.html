        <h1>Thursday 16th January</h1>
        <p>We set off a little later than usual to do the weekly supermarket shop. Since we had a Sainsbury's voucher we went there at Lyons Farm, easily spending more than the amount needed. We then went on to Findon Vale Garden Centre for a late(ish) cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the butchers (where she bought me a venison burger) and the library (where she borrowed a book on Vancouver and a more general one of Canada). I spent time working on my RCEA talk notes. Later I emailed the Rocky Mountaineer to ask if the stay in Vancouver can be extended.</p>
