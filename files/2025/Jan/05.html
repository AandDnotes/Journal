        <h1>Sunday 5th January</h1>
        <p>It started raining yesterday evening and didn't stop until this evening. Angela went out twice and so got wet twice! In the morning she went to church and in the afternoon she went to help take down the Christmas decorations in the church hall.</p>
        <p>I, however, didn't go out. I spent most of the day just doing three things, reading the newspaper, doing the jigsaw and working on my 'grandchildren' web page. I made some progress on all three.</p>
        <p>I did, however, have a telephone call from Alan just before lunch and we did have a chat with Paul in the afternoon when Angela got home (the iPad worked).</p>
