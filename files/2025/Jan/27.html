        <h1>Monday 27th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday Club, I added Mike W's comments to the newsletter write-up of the 'Dark Ages' talk. It was wet early, but sunny later in the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I joined two people from the Anglian Coast Network and worked through how to use Adestra. Angela went to give blood, but found that the session had been cancelled due to traffic holdups.</p>
