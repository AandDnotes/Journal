        <h1>Thursday 30th January</h1>
        <p>We started the day by measuring our blood pressure. We are both just slightly high.</p>
        <p>Then, after Angela hung out the washing, we went off in the sunshine to do the weekly groceries shop. We found that, for some reason, the Bostal Road was closed, so we had to go down to the Shoreham flyover and then along to Lyons Farm. We started by calling into Curry's to drop off a collection of old devices. Then we went to Argos (within Sainsbury's) to buy a new electric blanket, before doing our other shopping. The blanket, it seems, allows you to have a different temperature for your feet!</p>
        <p>Although we were a little later than usual, we went on to Findon Vale Garden Centre for a cup of coffee, getting home just in time to unpack the shopping and then get lunch. After that, since it was still sunny and quite calm, we went for a walk for over an hour, staying on pavements.</p>
        <p>When we got home I replied to David F-B and emailed the foot-lady to ask about availability and cost. I also tried to backup the iMovie library, but it is too big.</p>
