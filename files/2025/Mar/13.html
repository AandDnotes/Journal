        <h1>Thursday 13th March</h1>
        <p>Today we decided to go to Shoreham to do our weekly shop, so we went to Lidl and then on to Dunelm for coffee and to buy a couple of towels.</p>
        <p>After lunch I reassembled the nearside front wheel drum on the TC and started stripping down the nearside rear drum. I found that the cylinder was also leaking, but failed to get the handbrake linkages off the cable!</p>
        <p>After dinner I ran the PEI Group meeting.</p>
