        <h1>Saturday 8th March</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. We walked to the High Street to buy some rolls and a newspaper and I did the weekly accounts before lunch. I also cleaned my leather shoes, the black and brown pairs having mould on them! After lunch I went to Beeding to the Repair Cafe. It was fairly quiet, considering the fine weather. I did, however, bring home an old Dyson vacuum cleaner that won't start.</p>
        <p>A little later we went to Toddington Manor for the WSMGOC Annual Dinner. The only chance during the year that I get to wear my DJ. It was a good evening, although some on the table had finished their 'lamb' main course before those having fish got theirs. Then they forgot to serve our table with coffee. We were home a little after 10:30.</p>
