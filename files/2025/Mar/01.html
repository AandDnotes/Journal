        <h1>Saturday 1st March</h1>
        <p>The first day of meteorological Spring. And another fine, sunny, but chilly day.</p>
        <p>We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then I did the weekly and monthly accounts. Shortly after lunch Angela went to the Methodist church to help prepare for a St Barnabas 'beetle drive', along with a cream tea. I went down for the start and we got home just after five.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Victoria before we had a late dinner.</p>
