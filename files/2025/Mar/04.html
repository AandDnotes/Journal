        <h1>Tuesday 4th March</h1>
        <p>For me, today was about preparing for this evening's talk. So I finished charging the camera battery and downloaded/printed the attendance list. I also generated the next Adestra email, including my talk on SMRs. However, I need the link to the registration page before I can submit it.</p>
        <p>I also managed to spend an hour on my talk slide-set, although a lot of that was choosing a 'style' to use.</p>
        <p>Later I drove to Crawley for the talk. We had a surprising number of attendees (as many as had registered). Luckily it had been a fine day and it wasn't too cold when I cam out, even though it was a little later than usual. I got home at about 9:30.</p>
