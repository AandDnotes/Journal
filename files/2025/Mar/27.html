        <h1>Thursday 27th March</h1>
        <p>Another fine day. We started by going to Lyons Farm (both Lidl and Sainsbury's) and then went on to Findon Vale Garden Centre for coffee and to look at plants. I also completed my draft of the last RCEA talk (mainly written by Mike W) and sent it to him.</p>
        <p>Later I did some more measurements on the TC, this time the resistance of wires and of the coil in the petrol pump. I did some calculations and thought I now understood the measurements, but more thought made me unsure.</p>
        <p>Before dinner I joined the CC-UK meeting. Then we had an interesting hard-boiled egg and fish finger caesar salad for dinner.</p>
