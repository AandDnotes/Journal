        <h1>Sunday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of today working on the Dyson vacuum cleaner that I brought home from the last Repair Cafe. Either that of doing things related to it. I started by driving to Shoreham to buy some torx screwdrivers from Screwfix. I decided that there was little point in trying to make a tool. So I managed to get the whole thing apart and remove the motor. The carbon brushes had completely worn out and the motor was full of carbon dust. I also removed the cable reel so that I could get to the power switch, which is working fine. At the moment I can only find new brush assemblies, rather than just the carbon brushes and springs, which I could solder in.</p>
        <p>It was misty, with a little drizzle in the morning and heavier rain later. Angela went to church and worked around the house. Then we talked with Paul later in the day.</p>
