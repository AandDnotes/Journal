        <h1>Sunday 9th March</h1>
        <p>Another warm(ish), sunny and calm day. While Angela went to church I went into the garage. I initially tried some metric spanners (as suggested by someone at the Repair Cafe), but to no avail. A half inch AF seems to be the nearest fit. However, leaving the joint between the copper brake pipe and the flexible hose didn't seem to help. I decided that I would enquire at Simms to see if they would replace the slave cylinders and flexible hoses and change the fluid. So I cleaned the off-side brake drum and backplate and reassembled it. Then I stripped down the front near-side drum and cleaned it. Later I touched up the paint on the backplate and drum.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. It seems that they have moved on to 'summer' time, but the temperature is still near zero, even if most of the snow has melted. After dinner we spoke to Paul. Since the weather was fine they had been to the beach!</p>
