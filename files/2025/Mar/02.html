        <h1>Sunday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>The weather looks set to be fine for the rest of the week, although I didn't go out at all today. Angela went to church and I spent a lot of the morning researching SMRs. I had emailed Mike U and Dave P. Mike doesn't have a talk he is able to give, so I offered to produce a talk on SMRs. Dave cancelled the existing talk via the Events Database and Plus4Events.</p>
        <p>Later I printed the speaker certificate for Tuesday's IET talk and put one of the video camera's batteries on charge. Then we spoke with Paul and Rowan (briefly).</p>
