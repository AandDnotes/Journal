        <h1>Sunday 30th March</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day, although with a bit of a breeze. Angela went to church and did some more work on my article about ballast resistors. Then I went into the garage and started the TC. While it was running I checked the tyre pressures of the TC and the Panda.</p>
        <p>I transferred 'birthday money' for both Paul and Krista and then emailed Paul to with him a happy birthday in case our card hadn't arrive. Later we spoke to Paul and briefly with Rowan, who had enjoyed her school trip to London.</p>
