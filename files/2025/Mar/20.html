        <h1>Thursday 20th March</h1>
        <p>Another fine and even warmer day. We went off to Lyons Farm to do our weekly grocery shop. After a quick look at plants in B&amp;Q, we went on to Findon Vale Garden Centre for coffee and to look at plants.</p>
        <p>After lunch I disconnected the battery charger on the TC and looked at the petrol weeping from the carburettors. I tightened the hold-up bolts a little.</p>
        <p>The IET Adestra system will not be available for a time during April and May, so I reviewed the remaining IET events (I need to update the programme of event document) and emailed Dave P about adding two to Plus4Events. I also emailed Deshi about parking and Surrey's use of a QR code to get free parking.</p>
        <p>I also messaged Paul B about the note on our work on the CC-UK 'metrics' project, searched for a description of how to dismantle the Dyson vacuum cleaner I brought back from the Repair Cafe and investigated the use of ballast resistors for an ignition coil. Peter Cole suggested that I should fit one.</p>
