        <h1>Monday 31st March</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day, although the breeze was chilly. While Angela went to her Monday Club I started by working on my ballast resistor article. Then I went into the garage to clean the plugs on the TC and check the contact points. I initially mis-read the numbers on the feeler gauge and set the spark plug gaps too small. The engine took a lot of starting and then ran very unevenly. At first I thought it was running on three cylinders, but all four plugs were warm. So I checked the gaps again, reset them and the engine ran beautifully. I then topped up the battery.</p>
        <p>I had an email from Dave P about the event data. Later, Sam got things sorted out and will bee sending out a regional email with our events in it. So she will send out our email a little later.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I completed the ballast resistor article and uploaded it to my web site. I now need to copy it to my MG web site and prepare it for publication in Main Gear.</p>
