        <h1>Monday 17th March</h1>
        <p>Another cold day. While Angela went to her Monday club I started by working through my slide deck on SMRs. This time I only made a few alterations. Then I went into the garage, put the TC's battery on charge, emptied the tonneau area and removed the tonneau floor. This provides easy access to the rear brake flexible hose.</p>
        <p>I set the maturity option for one of Angela's bonds and made a start on writing notes on last Thursday's PEI group meeting.</p>
