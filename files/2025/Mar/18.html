        <h1>Tuesday 18th March</h1>
        <p>It was a clear blue sky all day, but with a cold breeze. I started by testing my SMR slides on the TV via an HDMI link.</p>
        <p>Ian M sent the risk assessments for STEM in the Park, so I sent them on to Lisa at the STEM Network.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I picked up Mike W and we went to Falmer for the talk on SMRs. It went well.</p>
