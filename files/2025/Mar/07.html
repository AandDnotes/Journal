        <h1>Friday 7th March</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Holmebush to do the weekly shop, but also to buy the items for Monday's lunch club. The difficulty is always to get condensed soup, which we could get from Tesco. We then had coffee in M&amp;S and were home by just after 11:30.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went off with Felicity and Barbara to St Andrews and I went into the garage to start trying to replace the brake slave cylinders and flexible hoses. Before I really got started David and Fran arrived to pick up their radio/CD player. I'd forgotten! Then when we tried it the CD would not play, although it did work after a few attempts. It had worked perfectly when I tried it a few days ago.</p>
        <p>Then I got back to the TC, but couldn't free the copper brake pipe from the flexible hose. So I left it with some WD40 on it.</p>
