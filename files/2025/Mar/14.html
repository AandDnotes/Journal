        <h1>Friday 14th March</h1>
        <p>I had three main things to do today, sort out my repeat prescription, get on with the slide set for my SMR talk and get more done on the TC. I managed to progress all three.</p>
        <p>It was a fine, sunny, although cold morning. We walked to the pharmacy and I was surprised that they had my prescription. The note with it still had the last issue at a date in the future! So I still don't know how the system works. We also asked in the health centre if they had an appointment for an RSV jab, but they were all taken and they don't know when they will get the next batch.</p>
        <p>Angela then did some cleaning and pottering while I worked on my slides. I put together those about the four contenders in the UK competition. There is then just the section on AMRs to do. However, I still have the animation to add and the talk is on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage. Angela did some gardening, but it was too cold. I reassembled the front near-side brake drum, then dismantled the near-side rear drum. It was pretty messy, I hope with brake fluid rather than differential oil and it took me a while to get the handbrake linkage out. After cleaning it up I reassembled it, again having trouble replacing the spring.</p>
