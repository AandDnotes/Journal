        <h1>Monday 10th March</h1>
        <p>A day of ups and downs, luckily more ups than downs. Angela went out early to the Lunch Club. I walked down to the health centre to try to sort out my repeat prescription, which might have worked, and then to Simms to book the TC in for the brake cylinders and hoses to be fitted.</p>
        <p>I went to Phylis's to help her take her deserts to the church and then stayed for lunch and to help clear up. When we got home I tried to export the video of the last IET talk from iMovie, but it failed. iMovie seemed to have problems displaying some parts of the video and was slow to respond. So I ran the camera files through Handbrake, reducing them to 1080p (a quarter the size of the originals). I will rebuild the recording.</p>
        <p>I also did a small amount to my SMR talk. Then, later, I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. However, when I tried to drive home I found that the road was closed. I went up to Ashington, but found that the road to Wiston was also closed. So I had to go down the A24, along the A27 and back over the Bostal.</p>
