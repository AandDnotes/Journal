        <h1>Tuesday 25th March</h1>
        <p>A busy and quite productive day. It was bright, but mostly cloudy and cool, although we did sit outside in the sun to drink our coffee this morning. We are hoping that Rowan's coach trip to England has gone well after their early start.</p>
        <p>I spent a while entering events into Plus4Events. Luckily Sam B got them working for me. Later I added the links to my Adestra email and submitted it. Sam agreed to enter the talks into the Events Database.</p>
        <p>After lunch I reassembled the Dyson vacuum cleaner, having decided that my resistance measurements indicated that one of the armature windings had broken. Later I messaged Carole P to give her the bad news.</p>
