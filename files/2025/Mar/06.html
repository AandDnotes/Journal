        <h1>Thursday 6th March</h1>
        <p>A relatively early start to a busy day. Mike W picked me up at nine o'clock to go to the RCEA committee meeting at Rustington. He dropped me home at about 12:15, arriving just as Angela was returning from having her hair cut.</p>
        <p>After lunch I asked Colin C for a link to a Zoom meeting for next week's PEI meeting. Later I sent the reminder to the PEI group.</p>
        <p>It was another fine day and so I went into the garage and put the TC up on axle stands. I can now tackle the brake cylinders.</p>
        <p>Later I joined the IET Education Volunteer 'listening session'. There were only seven EVs plus two staff members. There was general agreement that, while the items on the Marketing Toolkit were good, the rest was just a repeat of the STEM Network, which we were all using.</p>
