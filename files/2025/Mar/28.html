        <h1>Friday 28th March</h1>
        <p>Mike W could not open the Word file that I'd sent him. So I uploaded it to my IET Office 365, only to find that it only produced a blank. After battling with 365 I managed to open the file, but the images and tables were out of place, distorted and with the wrong spacing and fonts. So I put just the text into a document (which exported well) and sent it and the pdf file (which shows the layout) to the speaker for review.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took the jewellery that we'd sorted out before lunch to the jeweller in the High Street. He took it all, including the costume jewellery and the pearls, offering us Â£450. We had taken the more expensive items to a jeweller in Worthing some time ago.</p>
        <p>A little later I went into the garage and measured the voltage from the + terminal on the coil to the earth terminal on the control box, both just with the ignition turned on and with the engine cranking. The figures were as I had originally expected. So I had wasted quite a bit of time.</p>
