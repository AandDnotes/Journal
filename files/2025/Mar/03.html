        <h1>Monday 3rd March</h1>
        <p>Today was a relatively early start to firstly pick up Peter W and then driving to Shoreham station to catch the train to London. The 'London walkers' (ten of us including Alan and Louis who I had not met before) then walked to Chelsea, walked along the King's Road, down to the Thames embankment, back up to the King's Road and then back to Victoria.</p>
        <p>We couldn't walk through the Chelsea Hospital, except to go in to the cafe, where we had lunch, sat outside. At the end of our walk we had a meal in Wetherspoons in Victoria station before we caught the train home. I dropped Peter home and was home just before nine.</p>
