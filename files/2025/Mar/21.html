        <h1>Friday 21st March</h1>
        <p>A slightly disappointing day. For a start, the sun wasn't shining, although it was still mild. I went off before breakfast in the TC, driving it carefully and using the handbrake rather than the footbrake, to Simms. However, they were overloaded with work and two people were on holiday, so they asked if I could change my booking to April 1st. They put MoT work first and didn't know when the TC would be finished. So I drove the car home!</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street to buy a few things and I started putting together the next Adestra email, which has to include details of three talks, since the system will not be available for a while. I also started looking at Peter Cole's comments on my electronic indicator unit.</p>
        <p>After lunch I removed the ignition coil from the TC and measured its resistance. When in situ it measured 1.7 Ohms, but when disconnected it was 2.8 Ohms. So I will leave it as it is.</p>
