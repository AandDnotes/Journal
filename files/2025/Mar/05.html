        <h1>Wednesday 5th March</h1>
        <p>It was very misty this morning. Angela went off with her walking group, but the mist didn't lift until she was just arriving home. Meanwhile I moved the video files from the SD card to the iMac and loaded them into an iMovie project and did a little editing. I also updated the Adestra email (less the registration link). I had emailed Dave P, who, it turns out, was in Canada! Later I received the link, updated the email and submitted it, for it to be rejected since I'd forgotten to update a date.</p>
        <p>Later I went into the garage with the intention of putting the TC on axle stands. I started the engine (after a lot of turning) and moved it over a few inches. Then I discovered that I was sharing the car with a large, brown mouse! So I cleared out the tonneau area, where the mouse seemed to have been living, and removed the seat back so as to vacuum. So I got out the stands and the jack, but didn't lift the car.</p>
