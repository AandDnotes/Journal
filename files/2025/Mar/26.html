        <h1>Wednesday 26th March</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking (around the Lower Horseshoe) with her walking group. I split my day between doing more measurements on the TC and putting together the report on the RCEA's last talk. Although it started quite cloudy, later it was clear blue sky and a starry night. Rowan should have had a 'good weather' day in London.</p>
        <p>I measured the voltage across the battery, between the coil and earth and across the two supply terminals on the control box. I don't understand why the battery provides 12.7 V, the control box provides 11.7 V and the coil receives 8.5 V, when there only seems to be wires between them.</p>
        <p>However, I did nearly finish putting the RCEA talk report together. Some of the images took some effort to transfer across.</p>
        <p>After dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to hear a talk on 'beavers in Sussex', including what has been happening at Knepp. It was a good talk.</p>
