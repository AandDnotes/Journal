        <h1>Wednesday 19th March</h1>
        <p>A bright, calm day, starting with a clear blue sky, which became hazy during the day. However, it was considerably warmer. While Angela went walking along the river with her walking group I sorted out the items from yesterday evening's talk, including sending the numbers of attendees to the IET. I also sent a title slide to Ramon.</p>
        <p>Before coffee I continued making notes from last Thursday's PEI meeting. Then I went into the garage, took the battery off charge, removed the side screens and started the engine. It took a lot of turning before it fired and eventually started, but I ran it until it was up to running temperature and would tick over with the slow-running wound in. I also measured the resistance of the coil, since I had an email from Peter Cole asking if I had a negative spark (since the TC has been converted to a negative earth). An article written by Peter and Eric Worpe about ignition systems. I measured the resistance as 1.7 Ohms, whereas Peter and Eric say that it should be between 3 to 4 Ohms. This may be why it takes a lot of turning to start the engine when it is cold and I may need to fit a ballast resistor.</p>
        <p>After lunch I completed my notes and after dinner attended the Anglian Coast Network committee meeting, really just to see how they are getting on with using Adestra.</p>
