        <h1>Wednesday 12th March</h1>
        <p>Definitely a day of two halves. Angela went off walking with her group, up Mouse Lane and around that area. I took the Panda to Adversane to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers and with David F-B, who was driving in his MGF. We set off after coffee and followed a fairly easy route, ending up back at Adversane. Luckily, it stayed dry and reasonably bright, so we could have the hood down. I got home at about 2:45, when it was just starting to spit with rain.</p>
        <p>For me, the second half was working on my presentation. There is still a lot to do. When I have the content down I will add the annotation. And we did have a shower later, before it got dark.</p>
