        <h1>Saturday 15th March</h1>
        <p>I was pleased with what I achieved today. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper, rolls and courgette. The we went to the library and on to the Steyning Centre to see the exhibition about the proposed Glebe Farm development. It was dry and bright, but with a cold wind.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and completing my slides for Tuesday's talk.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Then I went into the garage and removed the offside rear brake drum. Luckily it was quite dry. However, I dismantled it and gave it a clean. Then I got it back together in time for a slightly latish afternoon tea. I now just need to get the car back on the ground, charge the battery so as to start the engine and remove the tonneau area floor so as to give easy access to the rear flexible brake hose.</p>
