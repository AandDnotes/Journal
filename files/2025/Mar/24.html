        <h1>Monday 24th March</h1>
        <p>Another day in which I spent most of my time 'playing' with the Dyson vacuum cleaner. I cleaned the motor and, in particular, the commutator and tested it. There are three test you can do, check that each strip on the commutator is isolated from the shaft, check that each pair of opposite strips have about the same resistance (180 degree test) and check that the resistance between each adjacent pair of strips again have about the same resistance. The first two test were fine, but the third had two strips with a higher resistance.</p>
        <p>Mike W said that he has a 'ball' Dyson in his shed, Which he offered me. But he thinks that it works, so there is not much point in cannibalising it.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her Monday club (for a short while) and then attended the Lunch Club AGM, where she gave the treasurer's report.</p>
