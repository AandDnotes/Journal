        <h1>Tuesday 11th March</h1>
        <p>A cooler, cloudier day, but a busy one. In fact, the morning was quite productive. I rebuilt the video recording of the last IET talk, starting by running the files from the camera through Handbrake to reduce them by a quarter. I also uploaded it to the IET Sussex YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>I phoned a person offering an air filter for a TC and left a message. He phone back later to say that it had been sold to the person who had bought his TC. I was also able to complete a draft of a note on the CC-UK 'metrics' work and sent it to Paul B for review.</p>
        <p>After lunch Peter W picked me up in his new Honda Jazz and took me to Field Place for the RCEA talk. It was interesting, but not technical. Later I did some more to my SMR talk slide-set.</p>
