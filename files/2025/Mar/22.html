        <h1>Saturday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>The warm, sunny and calm weather brought on by an area of high pressure is over. There was a little rain overnight and it is still mild, but the sun didn't really show itself. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper, some new potatoes and apples. Then I did the weekly accounts and reconciled the bank statement agains my spreadsheet. Before lunch I also completed the next Adestra email, which is now just waiting for the links to the registration pages. Angela did some more work in the garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They seem to be having problems with both Austin and Juniper. He doesn't want to do anything other than play computer games and watch videos. Victoria took him to a scout meeting, but he went into one of his bouts of not speaking. Juniper seems to argue with Victoria if she can't get her own way.</p>
        <p>I started taking the Repair Cafe's Dyson vacuum apart, but soon came to some torx screws that are deep down small openings. So I started trying to make a tool. If that doesn't work I will need to buy another set of screwdrivers.</p>
