        <h1>Saturday 29th March</h1>
        <p>Being Saturday we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a couple of other items. It was warm enough to sit out int he sun to drink our coffee. Then I again did the usual weekly accounts. I also started outlining an article on ballast resistors.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria. She is trying hard, but still seems to be struggling to get Austin and Juniper to do things other than play games on screens. And Brandon is still concerned about his new job.</p>
