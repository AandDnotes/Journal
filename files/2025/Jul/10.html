        <h1>Thursday 10th July</h1>
        <p>Rather than our usual morning trip to do the weekly grocery shopping, Angela went off to a funeral, so I enlarged the holes in my strip-board so that the legs on the larger components will fit and wired a power jack to the leads from the battery case. I also sorted out a few Lego pieces to take with us.</p>
        <p>After lunch (Angela had eaten scones at Squires with those she had gone to the funeral) We went off to do our weekly shop. We started by buying Angela a 'pack away' cagoule, then shopped in Waitrose and finally went to Lyons Farm. We bought mainly drinks in Sainsbury, then filled the Panda with fuel and then I bought some electrical solder in B&amp;Q. To my surprise they didn't have any Terry spring clips, which I think might help hold a heat shield on to the fuel line that runs above the exhaust manifold on the TC. In the heat it was quite a tiring outing.</p>
