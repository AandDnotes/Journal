        <h1>Sunday 20th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I deleted some files on my Google Drive and packed my case and backpack ready for tomorrow. Luckily everything fits. I'd said that I would pick up Angela from the church at 11:30. For some reason I thought I still had an hour before I needed to leave, but I was an hour out. So Angela walked home and we left for the WSMGOC BBQ later than intended. People were already eating when we got there, although we were not the last to arrive. It had rained in the morning, but it was dry apart from a brief shower, and was sunny at times.</p>
        <p>When we got home we spoke with Paul. They are going to Ibiza for their week's holiday at the start of August. Then Angela packed her case.</p>
