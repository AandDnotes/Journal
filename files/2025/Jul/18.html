        <h1>Friday 18th July</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day. I started by checking both our current account and our credit card account to see that payments had been made. All was well. Then, while Angela did some housework, I compiled notes on what we did during 2023 for my 'Year Notes' web page. Later I added the page to my web site.</p>
        <p>In connection with our planned trip to Canada I printed maps of downtown Toronto and Vancouver. Angela went to a table tennis session during the afternoon.</p>
