        <h1>Tuesday 15th July</h1>
        <p>Rain at last. But at least it stopped before we went out. Angela took her Lunch Club account books back to the church and then we went off to Worthing. After coffee in M&amp;S we shopped there and then searched for a new backpack for Angela. WE had to go to Goring for Angela to bank some Lunch Club cash, since the branch in Worthing does not have a counter!</p>
        <p>So we had a very late lunch, after which I added Angela's hearing aids as 'high risk' items on our house insurance. It cost quite a lot (as much as the Hidden Hearing insurance) and the extra cost went on the credit card. Unfortunately that pushed me over the credit limit (I'd forgotten that the direct debit does not get paid until the 17th)! So I had to pay Â£200 from our current account to the credit card.</p>
        <p>Later I created an account with ArriveCAN and entered details of our passports. Hopefully this will help when I enter our advanced information.</p>
