        <h1>Saturday 26th July</h1>
        <p>Another early start. We checked out of the hotel and took the subway to Union Station and the UP Express to Toronto Pearson airport. We found the Delta counter and a helpful person checked us in to both our flights and put labels on to our cases. There was no charge because they were only carry-on size. You can volunteer to check your bag at the gate for free.</p>
        <p>Then it was a two-hour flight to Atlanta, followed by a one and a half hour flight to Kansas City. The latter was delayed by about 50 minutes.</p>
        <p>We had a short wait after picking up our cases before Victoria appeared. It seems that they were not allowed to stop, so Brandon drove around the block and then pulled in to pick us up. He then drove us to Lee's Summit, where we met Gene and Claudia at their house. They went to bed early and we had a bite to eat.</p>
