        <h1>Saturday 12th July</h1>
        <p>An even hotter day. After our usual Saturday morning walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper I finished off the weekly accounts and then started checking my strip-board against the circuit diagram. I discovered that I'd forgotten to include a connector to take power and ground to the Arduino! So I cut and added a two-pin connector. Later in the day I modified my strip-board layout spreadsheet and printed it.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) lunch I took my tool bag (and the pressure washer) to the Repair Cafe. I spent some time getting the safety catch on Robin's circular saw to move (it just needed lubricating), found that the battery in a muscle massager was flat and increased the screen brightness on someone's iPhone. All in all it was pretty quiet.</p>
        <p>Just after dinner we had quite a long chat with Victoria. Later, Brandon uploaded quite a few photos and video clips.</p>
