        <h1>Monday 7th July</h1>
        <p>Much to my surprise, it is 20 years since the 7/7 London bombings. I remember a project manager coming back to the office having been in London that day.</p>
        <p>On a Monday morning Angela usually goes to her Monday Club, but this morning she went to Shirley's funeral service. I sent Adestra email text to Sam B, even though no one had replied to the draft. Then I set up the next PEI coordination meeting, getting a Zoom link from Colin C.</p>
        <p>Then I started tackling my strip-board for the RC car, cutting it to size. The holes that I'd drilled for some larger pins on components may need to be enlarged slightly, but I started soldering the hook-up wires between tracks. The short wires are very fiddly. I've done all the power and ground wires bar two.</p>
        <p>There was quite a lot of post (although the fibre washers for the TC's carburettors have only just beed dispatched), which meant quite a lot of filing of papers.</p>
