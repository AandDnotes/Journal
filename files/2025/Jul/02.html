        <h1>Wednesday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>I had an early start. I went off to a school in Hurtpierpoint to join Mike and Andrew for a fan-boat session. They had been there yesterday for morning and afternoon sessions. Luckily today was just the morning. I started by giving a talk on process automation and then on submarines. We finished the morning with the 'grand final' across the swimming pool. We had a little light rain while running the form races. I was home at about 1:15 after we cleared up and put the equipment (including the pond) in Mike's new van. It was quite a tiring session, mainly because I had to stand up most of the time.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela had been out with her walking group, going around the lower horseshoe. After lunch she had her hair cut. Meanwhile I cleared my actions from the IET events planning meeting. Then I modified my strip-board design, yet again.</p>
