        <h1>Thursday 24th July</h1>
        <p>Another early start and another busy day, although we spent most of it sitting down. We were first into breakfast this morning at 6:30 and then got to the bus pick-up point by the aquarium (via subway and walking) by about 7:30. There was some confusion over which bus we were on, since none of them said "Chariots of Fire", the company through which we had booked the tour to Niagra Falls. However, the driver of the first bus had us on his list. The two drivers seemed confused as well over who was where, but they sorted it out and we were away by then past eight. We had paid the driver for the boat trip.</p>
        <p>It's a long drive to Niagra Falls from Toronto, particularly with the heavy traffic. The drive gave an almost continuous commentary, it seemed sometimes at the expense of driving! When we arrived we had a quick stop at the floral clock and then at an 'outlet' to sample maple syrup, before stopping at the Skylon Tower. This wasn't on our original itinerary, but we bought tickets from the driver and went up it. The view from the top was quite good.</p>
        <p>Then it to the boat! Following a long queue (which actually moved quite quickly) we got on the boat and moved to the front, on the lower deck. It was very windy and in our red plastic macs it was difficult to do anything. However, all was well as we passed the American falls, but as we approached the Horseshoe falls the spray was to violent that we couldn't see anything and got very wet. We moved further back under some shelter, but it was really a waste of time.</p>
        <p>With very wet arms we went up to the town to find something to eat. This was not easy since there were long queues everywhere. Eventually we found an Appelby's and had two starters, which was too much for us. Then it was the long trek back to Toronto.</p>
        <p>Was it worth it? Really only to say that you had seen the falls.</p>
