        <h1>Thursday 31st July</h1>
        <p>Another day travelling. We managed to get everything packed into the car by ten o'clock, said goodbye and thank you to Gene and Claudia, and set off for Fayetteville.</p>
        <p>Victoria drove south to Harrisonville where we joined Interstate 49. In theory this takes us all the way to Fayetteville, but we stopped in Navada for coffee and then took state road 43 to Joplin, detouring to a state park in the hope that we would see some bison. We didn't, so continued to Joplin for lunch. Route 43 was actually much more interesting than travelling on the highway.</p>
        <p>From Joplin we rejoined I49 and continued to Fayetteville, arriving at their rented house at about 4:30. It was the first time that Austin and Juniper had been to Fayetteville and seen their new house. We will use Juniper's bedroom. She will use the lower bunk in Austin's room.</p>
