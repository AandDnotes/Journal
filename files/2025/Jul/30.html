        <h1>Wednesday 30th July</h1>
        <p>Another outing to Kansas City, this time to a museum about a paddle steamer that sunk in the Missouri river in 1838 (or thereabouts) and was found, buried 30 feet down in a farmers field. The boat had sunk in the mud and over the years the river had meandered and left the boat under dry land. It was an interesting story and the artefacts recovered were fascinating.</p>
        <p>We were back in Lee's Summit for a slightly late lunch and then spent the rest of the afternoon completing the 'marbles' jigsaw puzzle that they had started before we arrived. It was a very difficult one.</p>
        <p>After dinner we played a card game and then packed our bags.</p>
