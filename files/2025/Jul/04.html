        <h1>Friday 4th July</h1>
        <p>Since we were both out yesterday morning and then again in the afternoon we had to do our weekly grocery shop today, although I managed to finish the monthly accounts before we went out. Our list was fairly short and Angela wanted to look in some shops in Worthing, so we went to Waitrose. Indulgently, we started with coffee, then walked to the bank and shops and then returned to do our grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>Angela found some summer trousers in M&S and we found some cagoules that roll up and fit inside a small bag. These would be ideal to take away with us. However, it looks as though I will need to take one or two short-sleeved shirts away, with some sun cream, since there are few, light-weight, long-sleeved shirts around.</p>
        <p>I spent a little while working on the code for the RC car. I made progress, but it looks as though the MicroBlue library uses interrupts when a message arrives. So I can't control it with by timing the loop. However, I did make a little progress and made the joystick control the motor (at least going forward).</p>
