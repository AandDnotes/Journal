        <h1>Friday 4th July</h1>
        <p>Since we were both out yesterday morning and then again in the afternoon we had to do our weekly grocery shop today. Our list was fairly short and Angela wanted to look in some shops in Worthing, so we went to Waitrose. Indulgently, we started woth coffee, then walked into the bank and shops and then did our grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>Angela found some summer trousers in M&S and we found some cagouls </p>
