        <h1>Sunday 13th July</h1>
        <p>Another hot, sunny day. Angela went to church and I tested my strip-board. It ran the motors, but they ran, forward and backwards, at what appeared to be full speed and would not change speed. I put my oscilloscope on the output and could see the voltage pulse widths changing, but when I added the motor, it was just constant! It took me a while to set up a test system. I had to use the new Uno (which meant unplugging the wires), since the IDE failed to download the test sketch to an old Arduino, but at least I could change the speed.</p>
        <p>As usual, we spoke with Paul during the afternoon. Apart from a couple of trips to school, Rowan has no more lessons. She's had her test results, but didn't volunteer to tell us. They haven't yet decided where they want to go for a holiday.</p>
        <p>We spent some time watching the men's final at Wimbledon.</p>
