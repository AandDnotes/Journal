        <h1>Sunday 27th July</h1>
        <p>By the time we got up Gene and Claudia had gone to church. Brandon then took us to a restaurant for breakfast! When we got back we did some jigsaw puzzle until we stopped for some mango for lunch.</p>
        <p>G & C had been (over) cooking some beef, which we had for an early dinner along with home-grown, courgettes, round beans and potatoes. They had bread rolls as well. Then we had cherry pie and played a card game until they went to bed (before eight).</p>
