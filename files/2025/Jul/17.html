        <h1>Thursday 17th July</h1>
        <p>We didn't achieve a great deal today. We started by going to see the Hidden Hearing man at the Health Centre. He added the 'loop' programme and showed Angela how to change the filters that go between the tube and the 'dome' (the bit that fits in your ear). He will call at our house in January for another check-up. We also bought some food on the way home.</p>
        <p>I had suggested that we get some slipper socks that wouldn't take much space in our cases and could be worn in Claudia's and V&B's rented house. We'd seen them in the Findon Vale garden centre, so after lunch we drove there. Unfortunately they had sold out! We also looked in Squires, but they didn't have any either.</p>
        <p>I started making notes for my 'Year Notes' for 2023 and 2024 and then after dinner I called Alan. They are well, although Richard has broken his collar bone by going over the handle bars of an electric scooter.</p>
