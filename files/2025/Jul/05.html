        <h1>Saturday 5th July</h1>
        <p>Our usual walk to the High Street on a Saturday morning was followed by a drive to the Old Barn garden centre at Dial Post. We knew that they sold outdoor clothing and so thought that they might have cagoules that roll up into an small bag. They did, but only mens, although in a sale. The bright yellow ones were the cheapest (presumably because it was not a popular colour), so I bough one.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we had a short chat with Victoria. Brandon travels to Arkansas a week tomorrow (to start work on the 14th) then Victoria will go there on the 17th just before their furniture arrives.</p>
        <p>I spent some time investigating the example code for controlling a car via the MicroBlue app. It uses a motor on each wheel, adjusting the speed so as to steer the car. I discovered that R4 of the Arduino Uno separates the USB interface from the RX/TX pins, so I don't have to use the software serial library and another pair of pins. I modified the pins for the motors and downloaded the code to the Arduino. It seems to work. So I updated my circuit schematic. I can now concentrate on making the strip-board version.</p>
