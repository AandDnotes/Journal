        <h1>Monday 28th July</h1>
        <p>Gene and Claudia took us for a tour of Kansas City, pointing out the landmarks as they drove. We then went to a Kansas barbecue restaurant for lunch. As usual, a lot of food.</p>
        <p>We then went to Union Station to see it and a collection of model railway layouts. They were very good.</p>
