        <h1>Wednesday 9th July</h1>
        <p>My Sussex Wanderers day started with a phone call from David F-B to say that he was unwell. So I would be going on the run without a navigator. Angela went off to join her walking group at about the same time as I left for Denmans Gardens at Fontwell. After coffee I followed someone in an MGB around the route, with some very bumpy roads towards the end. By the time that I got home, at about 2:30, I had done a total of 68 miles.</p>
        <p>It was very hot and shortly before getting home the engine started to stutter. I think this is due to fuel vaporisation. Certainly the fuel pipe to the front Carburettor is directly above the exhaust manifold. Although my fibre washers arrived today (along with the nylon nuts &amp; bolts) I think that the fuel leaks are actually coming from the jet assemblies.</p>
        <p>Angela' walking group took the long route to The Hub, so didn't walk all that far.</p>
        <p>After a cup of tea I made up and soldered the remaining wires on my strip-board. I'm more or less out of solder, so I hope I can get some tomorrow.</p>
