        <h1>Tuesday 8th July</h1>
        <p>Angela walked to the library to return a Canada guide. I started by taking the TC to the petrol station, to ensure that I had enough for tomorrow's Wanderers run. I also printed the route instructions. Then, after putting some bread on to cook I spent the rest of the morning preparing and soldering wires onto the strip-board.</p>
        <p>After lunch I firstly managed to get the U&amp; TV channels on the freesat box. It seems that the U channels recently changed from encoding them as MPEG-2 to MPEG-4. So I had to delete the channels and then re-scan them all. Then I checked the TC's carburettors and tightened the hold-up bolts slightly. I'm not sure they needed tightening and I think the leakage is more likely to be from the jet assemblies than from the hold-up bolts. The fibre washers that I ordered have not arrived. I then did some more soldering. It is a slow process, at least for me.</p>
