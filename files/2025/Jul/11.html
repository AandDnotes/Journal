        <h1>Friday 11th July</h1>
        <p>A hotter day than yesterday. While Angela went to the High Street I did the weekly accounts (so far), checked that there was enough money in our account to pay the credit card bill and added Canadian dollars and  US dollars to our Post Office Money Card. The first payment was accepted, but the second was refused and my debit card frozen. I had to call Barclays to get the card released and the payment made.</p>
        <p>Then, after lunch, I turned my attention to the strip-board. While soldering components to the board I discovered that I had put the power and ground connections on the wrong side of the power converter. So I had to remove them and make and fit new ones. Then I fitted the rest of the components.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela went to the table tennis group garden party.</p>
        <p>After dinner (at least I had eaten, but Angela had something later) we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick for an hour and a half.</p>
