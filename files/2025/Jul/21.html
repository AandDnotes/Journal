        <h1>Monday 21st July</h1>
        <p>During the morning Angela packed her case and I checked in to our flights. However, the web page allowing download of the boarding passes closed and I couldn't get back to it of get at the document download. I also completed the Canadian customs details, so as to make our entry easier. Then, after an early dinner we set off, with carry-on size cases in tow, to the bus stop. Then the number 2 bus took us to Shoreham station. Since there is only one bus each hour we arrived just before an earlier train to Gatwick, so our specific train tickets wouldn't open the barrier until that train had departed. Luckily the station guard let us in.</p>
        <p>So we arrived at the South Terminal, took the shuttle to the North Terminal and checked into the Hilton hotel. We then went into the terminal and back to South terminal for a bite to eat before returning to the hotel. I didn't get much sleep!</p>
