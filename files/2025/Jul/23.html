        <h1>Wednesday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>After quite a good night's sleep we were up reasonably early, showered and had breakfast before setting off for Union Station. It was already hot, but we walked, if only to see how long it took. Too long in that heat, even though we walked mainly in the shade.</p>
        <p>We started by going in to the Tourist Information centre, where we got a map and details of the city bus tours and the ferry timetable. We then walked through to where we will pick up the bus tomorrow to Niagra Falls. We also bought tickets for the Toronto city bus tour. The first bus that came along was full, so we decided to take a walk and get on the bus at another stop, which we did. Since the tour took two hours, we had thought of getting off somewhere and catching the next (or another) bus, but it was too early to stop for lunch when we came to the most promising area. So we stayed on for the whole tour, plus another couple of stops. We then took a walk around Queens Harbour before walking back to Union Station and getting the subway back to the station near the hotel.</p>
        <p>After a while I went for a short swim. There's' not much in the way of changing facilities, but the swim was good, even if it was short. Then we walked to the supermarket on the corner and bought some salad and cheese for our meal.</p>
