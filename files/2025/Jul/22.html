        <h1>Tuesday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>The real start of our holiday. We were up early to check our cases and print our boarding cards. Then we went back to the hotel to have breakfast, before returning to the North Terminal to go through security. Before long we boarded the plane and, after an eight hour flight landed in Toronto.</p>
        <p>Getting through passport control and customs was very easy and quick. However, our attempt to take the UP Express to Downtown Toronto got off to a false start since I'd not realised that the monorail was just a local 'back and forth' shuttle and we needed to get off at Terminal 1 (we had arrived at Terminal 3) and get on the UP (Union to Pearson Express). Having finally reached Union station we bought tickets for the subway (metro) and travelled to the station nearest our hotel.</p>
        <p>We found that we had been given a small suit! However, when we tried to use the coffee machine it spurted grounds all over the counter top and me. We were shown how to use the machine without that happening (we had followed what it said on the capsule).</p>
        <p>We had WhatsApp'd the family to say that we had arrived. Then we went for a short walk and bought a few items for a light meal. A very long and tiring day!</p>
