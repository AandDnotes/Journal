        <h1>Tuesday 1st July</h1>
        <p>The hottest day of the year so far. Angela walked to the High Street, but I stayed inside. I spent quite some time revising my strip-board layout, mainly so as to reduce the number of columns to fit the board that I have.</p>
        <p>I spent a little while revising my estimate of the cash that we need to take on holiday. I also revised my credit card spreadsheet to show when the direct debit gets paid.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the IET Sussex events sub-committee meeting. We didn't get very far with our programme of talks.</p>
