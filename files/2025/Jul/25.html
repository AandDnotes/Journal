        <h1>Friday 25th July</h1>
        <p>Today we had a later start and walked down Yonge Street to the harbour where we caught the ferry to Toronto Island. We had to wait half an hour before taking the 15 minute sail to Wards Island and then walked along to the Centre Island, stopping for coffee en route. We also had a slight diversion on to one of the other islands, which was mainly residential.</p>
        <p>We stopped for lunch (fish and chips) before catching the ferry back to the harbour. After a sit down with an ice cream cone we went in search of the Toronto PATH. It took a while, but then we found lots of underground tunnels, shopping areas and food courts. We walked all the way to Dundas (after asking a couple of times) and emerged on to the street. It was a pity that we then turned the wrong way! Eventually we got back to the hotel.</p>
