        <h1>Saturday 19th July</h1>
        <p>We woke to heavy rain and an overflowing gutter. So we dressed in wellies, waterproof trousers and cagoules and walked to the High Street under umbrellas. We stayed dry, but sweated a lot. I then did the weekly accounts and wasted time looking at a means of creating an app on the iPad to interface via Bluetooth to the Arduino, only to find that I can't install an app on an iOS device without having an Apple Development licence (at a cost of $99).</p>
        <p>Luckily the rain had stopped by lunchtime and there were sunny periods. I cleaned out the gutters and trimmed the top of the bay tree, while Angela pottered in the gardens.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Victoria and Brandon. They are in Fayetteville, expecting their furniture to arrive tomorrow. Brandon's first week in his new job seems to have gone well.</p>
