        <h1>Monday 14th July</h1>
        <p>It was 'lunch club' day, so Angela went off early to the church. I spent the morning working on the RC car project. My test system worked after I linked the ground of the Arduino and the motor controller. Then I found that the Arduino code had a minimum speed set to 40%. After changing it to 10% the change of speed was more obvious. It then took quite some time to bolt together the Arduino and the strip-board. I also added a cut-down piece of connector to help support the Bluetooth module, rather than just rely on the pins.</p>
        <p>I walked down to the church for lunch. We got home by about 3:30. I then tried to reconcile a bank statement that arrived today with my spreadsheet. I failed to do that, so, for the moment, I've just noted it.</p>
        <p>Later I joined a Zoom meeting about PEI event coordination. The link failed, so I had to open Zoom and enter the ID and passcode. Guy B had the same problem, but, in spite of sending an email to the others, no one else joined.</p>
