        <h1>Sunday 6th July</h1>
        <p>Today we received the final information document for our Rocky Mountaineer trip. It doesn't help a lot, but I printed it and put it in the file.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did a little work on my strip-board, checked the tyres on both cars and put wax on the TC. Later I drilled holes in the strip-board.</p>
        <p>A little earlier than usual we had a chat with Paul. There were several heavy showers during the day, with a good sprinkling of remote thunder.</p>
