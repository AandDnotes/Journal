        <h1>Thursday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>An unusual day. I had agreed to go with Angela to a hearing appointment at the health Centre, but with a company. However, for some reason I thought it was in the afternoon, but both her appointment and my RCEA committee meeting were at 10am!</p>
        <p>So Mike W picked me up just after nine (in his 'new' van) and drove me to Rustington. On the way home I got a call from the audiologist to talk about new (very expensive) hearing aids for Angela. She said that she was not going to buy 'private' hearing aids, but when she found out that she had lost 60% of her hearing, particularly at both high and low frequencies, she decided to buy them, at £4,800! We agreed that we would go back down this afternoon.</p>
        <p>So when I got home I transferred money into our current account and we went down at 3:30. I had checked that the retail price of the hearing aids is about £3,800, so the rest covers the 'unlimited' services. We went down and came back with the hearing aids. We had to install the app on my phone, since the version of iOS on Angela's is too old. At home we managed to pair them with the TV box.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon and early evening I did the monthly accounts, apart from updating the shares spreadsheet.</p>
