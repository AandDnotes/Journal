        <h1>Wednesday 16th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went out with her walking group I walked down to the library to return a book. I met the girls next door and Russel on the way.</p>
        <p>Angela went out again, this time down to the High Street, and I finally got around to adding the last two MG trips to my 'outings' page.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the Anglian Coastal LN committee meeting. They are a very active group and had lots of ideas for events, but it went on for a long time.</p>
