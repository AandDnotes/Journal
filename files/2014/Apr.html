        Tuesday</p>
        <p>I ran an experiment with a wire dipole antenna, gradually reducing its length and noting the RSSI values. The adjustments in length were fairly coarse (2-5mm) and so the one observed high point around the half-wavelength might have been a resonant spike.<br />
        Finally I tackled the nose wheel on my aircraft. I made a pin a panel pin, drilled a hole through the nylon horn and into the brass collet and inserted the pin. This should prevent the collet from rotating in the horn.<br />
        This evening I drove to Crawley, to the Hawth, to an IET talk on airborne early warning radar.</p>
        <p>2 April 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>My morning started with a walk to the top of the Downs, up to the flying site. Today was a site maintenance day. While Barry drove the road roller and Chris drove his ride-on mower, I re-marked the lines with creosote. Others worked on the box and some filled small holes in the strip.<br />
        After lunch I modified my RC code, changing the interface to the RF module, and built a balanced dipole.</p>
        <p>3 April 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We were quite early getting to Dad's this morning to compile his shopping list. That meant that we were back by 11:45 with his shopping. In addition to putting away his food (and writing instructions on his ready meals) and filling his pill box, I called Scottish Power and arranged for them to take over the supply of his electricity, in addition to his gas. This was a very long telephone conversation and the process could take up to five weeks to complete!<br />
        So we had a rather late lunch. But then, while Angela took Bay's food to her, I did a range test of my balanced dipole antenna. This turned out to be slightly worse than a simple dipole! I also backed up various RC-related files on to the Mac.<br />
        We finally received the quotation from the flooring man. I left. Message for him to contact me. I also had an e-mail from Tony Kennard, confirming the dates to start work on our kitchen, so I replied to him.</p>
        <p>4 April 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A good day. It started with a trip to the flying site. I was the first there, and then only two other people arrived. I had four flights, but the nose wheel on my plane still twisted on landing, in spite of my work on it. Then my attempts to land with the nose wheel high resulted in a stall and even more bending of the nose wheel. On the final flight the landing also broke the side of the engine bay.<br />
        Meanwhile, Angela took the bus to Worthing. On her return we had a late lunch and then took the sofa cushion covers to the upholstery shop in Worthing and I called into the model shop to buy a new nose wheel assembly and some glue. Whilst there I discovered that my kit had arrived!<br />
        This evening I went to the flying club auction night.</p>
        <p>5 April 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A quieter day. We got up late, walked to Beeding to get a paper and then on to Steyning to go to the library and buy meet and bread. I then opened my kit and started looking at the instructions. After lunch I checked the kit contents. I also did the weekly and monthly accounts and sent John's talk synopsis to Hamish. Before dinner we spoke to Paul et al, because he is going to New York tomorrow afternoon.</p>
        <p>6 April 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>We were up a little earlier than usual and were back from our walk to Beeding newsagents by 9:40. So I had time to catch up on most of yesterday's newspaper! After that I scanned through the rest of the instruction booklet for my kit and, as part of my tidy-up in the study and transfer of things electronic to my desk, I completed my power supply by adding the remaining sockets and labelling them all. I also did a short test of the coax dipole antenna after I had shortened the braid section.<br />
        After lunch, since the weather was dry and tomorrow's forecast was wet, we went to Dad's. We cut his grass, pruned a shrub or two and helped him trim his privet hedge. When we got back we spoke with Victoria and Austen. Brandon had gone away for a course for a couple of days.</p>
        <p>7 April 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>It rained for most of the day. So I spent time on various RC projects. I started by setting up the Cub plan in preparation for the build. I then turned my attention to the Super Star nose wheel. The fixing holes of the new wheel assembly are in a different position, so it was necessary to fill the old holes and then fuel proof the lower area of the engine bay. Tomorrow I will try cutting and bending the leg and fitting the wheel. Finally I made a start on modifying the code of my ground station and plane so as to make use of the full ten bits of resolution on the stickes.<br />
        During the early evening I went to the IET events sub-committee meeting.</p>
        <p>8 April 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>For part of the morning, before lunch, I worked some more on replacing the nose wheel on my plane. The wheel mount is now fixed to the firewall and I have cut down that end of the wire leg.<br />
        Alan phoned, saying that he had invited Dad to stay with them over Easter!<br />
        After lunch we collected Bay and took her into Worthing. While she and Angela went shopping, I went to the model shop to buy tools and materials to start building my kit. We then met up in Waitrose to have a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>9 April 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Today I managed to complete the installation of the new nose wheel on my plane. I bent the 5/32&quot; diameter wire through 90 degrees by heating it with a blow lamp first. So now it should be ready to fly. I also completed the implementation of using two bytes for the value of each stick so that the full 10 bit resolution is used.<br />
        When Angela returned from table tennis I cut the back grass and then started investigating the use of a blog site to record my Piper Cub build and my RC equipment design.</p>
        <p>10 April 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>This morning I started building my Piper Cub. Although I only managed to build the fin and rudder. Meanwhile, Angela went to do the weekly shopping, since I had a hygienist appointment. After lunch, while Angela went to her WI meeting, I went over to Dad's. There I filled his pill box, took him to the bank in Lancing and went on to Worthing to pick up our sofa cushions from the Upholstery Warehouse. After a cup of tea with Dad I came home and glued together the rudder of the Cub before starting to cook dinner.</p>
        <p>11 April 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I spent the morning at the flying site. I managed three flights and my new nose wheel survived some bumpy landings. After lunch I went to Beeding for a haircut. Then I started building the tailplane for the Cub. Since some of the laser-cut pieces did not match the plan very well, this took longer than expected. I also did some work on my RC blog.</p>
        <p>12 April 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The day started with our usual walk to the Beeding newsagents, followed by a look at some of the parts of Saturday's paper. Then I sanded the tailplane of the Cub, including the rounded leading edge, and, after lunch, built the two parts of the elevator. Again the pieces did not match the plan very well. I also checked over the car and did the weekly accounts, reconciling entries with the bank statement. During the afternoon Angela went to the church hall to help with Daphne and Peter's 'drop-in' leaving party.<br />
        We heard from Brandon that they have booked their flights to Sarasota. They leave the UK on Thursday 5th June!</p>
        <p>13 April 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After more walking to Beeding and reading of the paper, I did a little sanding of the elevators on huge Cub. Then, when Angela returned from church we started making trifles! I made eight jellies while Angela jammed sponge for four trifles and covered them with fruit cocktail. This afternoon, after returning from Dad's, Angela made ten pints of custard while I cooked dinner. Then, when the custard had cooled a bit, I covered the trifles.<br />
        Earlier we went to Dad's, changed his bed, vacuumed around and put on his washing so that he will have enough cloths to take away with him.<br />
        We also spoke to both Paul and Rowan and, later, Victoria and Austin.</p>
        <p>14 April 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Angela got off to a relatively early start with her four trifles for the lunch club. She also had to take her WI bag with her so that she could go to their meeting after lunch.<br />
        Meanwhile I spent the day working on my model Cub. I finished sanding the elevators, added the joining wire and cut the slots for the hinges. Then, while cutting the chamfers on the control surfaces, where they join the tailplane and fin, I made a mistake. I cut the chamfers on the fin rather than on the rudder. So I replaced the trailing edge of the fin.<br />
        After speaking to Dad I phoned Alan. Chris and Laura will call into Dad's at about 2pm on Wednesday, after taking the boys to the beach.</p>
        <p>15 April 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning I completed the tailplane of the Cub, including the replaced trailing edge to the fin. After lunch I went up to the flying site. It was quite cold, in spite of the sun.. I only had two flights, both with bumpy landings. In fact the second landing broke off the side panel of the engine bay and damaged the underside of the fuselage just behind the firewall. Some more significant repairs are needed!<br />
        During the evening I made some additions to my RC blog, mainly about the electronics.</p>
        <p>16 April 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning I removed the engine, mount and nose wheel from my plane and cut out the damaged wood. After an early lunch I went to Dad's to help him pack before he was collected by Laura and Chris. While waiting for them I tried to fix his dripping tap, but the screw holding the handle sheared! So I cut his grass. Afterwards I went to the model shop to buy some balsa sheets and some covering material to repair my plane. I also bought a length of brass tube to try making yet another type of dipole antenna. When I got home I cut one (the engine bay side wall) of the two pieces of balsa sheet that I need.</p>
        <p>17 April 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We had a fairly early start to the weekly shop and we did not need to do much for Dad, so we stopped for a cup of coffee.<br />
        After lunch I fitted the two pieces of balsa to my plane and mailed Gary Williams about available dates for his talk. I also cleared the weeds from the gutters in the road and cut back the box hedge in front of the compost bins.</p>
        <p>18 April 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Today I painted the inside face of the new engine compartment side, glued on the weights, covered the balsa with solarfilm and put fuel proofer on the engine compartment. I also made another dipole antenna using a piece of brass tube. The range test were not spectacular.<br />
        As I was cutting the front grass, so Paul et al arrived. We walked up to the farm before dinner and played a game after dinner.</p>
        <p>19 April 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We were woken at about the usual time by Rowan. I walked to Steyning to get a paper and some gin! When I got home, Paul and Krista had gone out to look at a house in Angmerring, but Rowan was at home with Angela. We played with Rowan and went out in the garden, coming in to give her some lunch. She collected feathers and dandelion flowers in her bucket. Shortly afterwards, Victoria et al arrived. Austin had been sick on the journey and they had stopped at Cobham services. Paul and Krista arrived back shortly afterwards.<br />
        After lunch, and a play, they all went for a walk while we started preparing dinner. It was not a very restful birthday for Angela!</p>
        <p>20 April 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Easter Sunday started with a relay of breakfasts and then, after a shower, straight into preparing for lunch. I collected Bay a little after twelve, while Paul, Krista and Rowen went to see Glen at their new house in Lancing. We had a good shoulder of lamb. After lunch, and a bit of a sit down, we all went into the garden, including Bay. It was wet all morning, but the sun came out at about three o'clock and the children had a good time running around the garden in their wellington boots.<br />
        After a buffet tea P, K, V and B walked down to Steyning to meet up with some of Paul's school friends and I took Bay home. Rowan had been put to bed, but Austin was still up. We started watching TV, but Rowan woke and Austin just wanted to play. So while Angela comforted Rowan I put Austin in his bed and he soon went to sleep. Rowan also settled.</p>
        <p>21 April 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Easter Monday started with breakfast for everyone in the dining room. I then went off to meet Alan at the Cobham services and bring Dad back for lunch. We were back in time for me to go to collect Bay. Victoria et al left at about 3pm, with Paul et al leaving an hour later. After some tea, I took Bay and Dad home. At least we now have a day to recover!</p>
        <p>22 April 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today was a catching up day. I uploaded photos and video clips, but have not yet edited them. I also did the weekly accounts after Angela paid in Bay's cheque. After lunch I pumped up the tyres on the bicycles and we went for a short ride. We only went down to Annington and back along the Downs Link, then up deBrose Way and along Goring Road.<br />
        I started reassembling my plane. I put back the undercarriage and engine mount. I discovered that the cut-out is in the wrong place, since if did not allow for the depth of the engine mount bolt heads. So I had to make it larger and then coat it with epoxy as a fuel proofer. So I started laying out the first wing of the cub. It seems that the die-cut parts are also not very accurate. The slots in the trailing edge are too wide and the slots in the ribs are too small!</p>
        <p>23 April 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Today was hospital day for Dad. We went for the first appointment at Southlands hospital at 10:30. Then, after lunch, we went back for his 1:30 appointment. Cream went on his head the first time and he sat under the red light on the second. He was back home by 2 o'clock. I had taken my lunch and eat it while he had his dinner.<br />
        When I got home I made an appointment for us to talk to someone at Santander on Monday and booked cinema tickets. Then I cut the back grass. I also mailed Mike and Hamish about the prospective visit to L3-Link.</p>
        <p>24 April 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Angela made an early visit to the audiology clinic to get new batteries before we went to do the weekly shop. I had written Dad's list yesterday, so we went straight off to Sainsbury's at Hove, where we had coffee before going to M&amp;S.<br />
        This afternoon, while Angela took Bay's shopping to her, I refitted the engine to my plane. I had hoped that I could try it tomorrow, but the weather forecast does not look good. I started aligning the wing parts, but discovered that the undersides of the ribs are not flat, as shown on the plan, but slightly curved forward of the main spar. This causes the leading edge to be slightly raised off the plan, so I mailed a question to the manufacturer's support team.</p>
        <p>25 April 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>What a dismal day! It did not stop raining until late in the afternoon. Angela went to Steyning and to Bay's this morning, but I spent most of the day either updating mr RC blog or searching for brushless motors. However, I did e-mail Simon to see if he wanted to meet for a beer.</p>
        <p>26 April 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Saturday, so we start with a walk to the newsagents in Beeding. Angela also took Bay's parcel to the Post Office. The rest of the morning was then spent updating the weekly accounts, cropping photos taken at Easter and combining video clips. I loaded the photos and video on to the iPad so that I can show them to Dad and Bay.<br />
        Apart from reading today's paper, I added a little more to my RC blog. Then I cut the edges of Angela's vegetable patch. I also tried out the cordless trimmer. But the battery ran out after only a couple of minutes!</p>
        <p>27 April 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to the newsagents, I spent a lot of the morning researching the monitoring of a battery using the Arduino.<br />
        After lunch we went over to Dad's to change his bed and tidy up. Later, I e-mailed people to tell them that Simon and would be meeting for a beer.</p>
        <p>28 April 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by driving to Shoreham and catching the Coastliner bus into Worthing. After stopping for a coffee in Debenhams we went to the Conought Studio to see the 11:30 screening of 'Love Punch'. It was quite entertaining, if a little implausible at times. I think this was the first time that I have been to the cinema in the morning since I went to the children's Saturday morning screenings in Potters Bar!<br />
        We then had a quick sandwich in the St Pauls cafe before going to an appointment we had at Santander. I opened my own 1-2-3 account and then we both opened two-year ISAs, transferring our Santander and Leeds ISAs and adding this year's allowance. Actually I needed to go to Barclays to make the payment. An assistant took me to one of the account management machines to do it, but it would only allow up to &#163;1,500 per transfer! The guy at Santander was very efficient. I now need to set up a standing order to pay &#163;500/m into the 1-2-3 account and move two of our direct debits from Angela's account into mine. In July we can top up these ISAs when the allowance changes. We can take money from Angela's Santander Everyday account, which is now only paying 0.5%.<br />
        We then did a little shopping in Worthing ( Boots and Millets) before catching the bus (initially the wrong bus) back to Shoreham. We were home at about 5pm.<br />
        In the evening I watched last Friday's episode of 'Agents of Shield', only to find that I had not watched the previous episode which seemed to have some significant events in the plot!</p>
        <p>29 April 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>In spite of the forecast of heavy showers, today was a fine day. I spent the morning filing! Mainly due to a need to deal with the paperwork from yesterday. Needless to say, I did not empty the in tray.<br />
        After lunch the weather improved and so I took my plane up to the flying site. In spite of signs saying that the Bostal was closed, the site was accessible. However, the gate had been replaced, due to being pulled out of the ground by someone. I had several flights, including some where I landed the plane, taxied back across the strip and taking off again. I had some bouncy landings, but found that I was approaching too fast. It was nearly six o'clock before I got home.</p>
        <p>30 April 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>More filing! Plus the things that go with it, such as updating files and sorting out older papers.<br />
        This afternoon I drained down the central heating and refilled it, including some corrosion inhibitor. Opening each radiator and then filling each took quite a long time. There is still some bleeding of radiators to be done.<br />
        After dinner I met up with Simon and Terry for a beer. It seems that not only has the Velocity project been cancelled, but Mike Callil has left, along with a number of other people, including the MD of Eurotherm and Steve Elliot.</p>
