        <p>1 September 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>The morning seemed to be spent doing nothing in particular. Although I guess we spent a lot of time playing with Rowan. However, after lunch P et al walked round to Bay's, so we had a quiet afternoon. Angela went in the garden and I worked on my model. I balanced the plane laterally, being surprised how much plywood I had to add to one wingtip. I also fitted the wing servo. I had to make the hole smaller by gluing pieces of ply to the underside and into the hole. So it is ready now for final sanding and then covering.</p>

        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning Paul took Angela (and Krista and Rowan) to Dad's and took him to Worthing Hospital for his appointment. They seem to want to take another biopsy! I went to Horley to meet up with mar, Dhiraj, Ian and Malek, since Dhiraj is leaving. He is going to Baines as a 'management consultant'. I got home at about 2:45 and we spent the rest of the afternoon doing little except reading the paper and playing with Rowan.</p>
        <p>3 September 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning Paul and I took Rowan down to the playground at Fletchers Croft, getting back in time for a late lunch. Although I had thought of going flying after lunch while Angela went to table tennis, I started cutting the grass instead. However, I did manage to do a little to the arm on the aileron servo before starting in the garden.</p>

        Thursday</p>
        <p>This morning Angela drove to Dad's, where I filled his tablets and she compiled his shopping list before going off to Holmbush. I waited for P et al to collect me go on to the new Splashpoint swimming pool. We had a long swim/splash/play before getting home for a late lunch. Meanwhile, Angela did all the shopping. After lunch I cut the remaining part of the lawn while Angela went to Bay's.</p>
        <p>5 September 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Paul and Krista decided to go to Brighton today, on their own! So we looked after Rowan. We took her to Beeding, to the cafe, where she played with some toys and ate cake. We then went on to the playground. We were home at about one and had lunch, after which we tried to get her to have a nap. However, by about 3 o'clock we decided to take a short walk to deliver Angela's WI newsletters. Rowan was asleep in her buggy after about five minutes. P &amp; K were back when we returned.<br />
        Later they went off to see Glen and his family in Lancing and after dinner I went to the first SRFC meeting of the Autumn. It was a talk by a volunteer from the Kent, Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance charity.</p>
        <p>6 September 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Today was planned to be a quiet day. Paul et al left for Bristol at about 9:30 and we went down to Steyning to buy meat, a few groceries and a newspaper. I then did the weekly accounts. That seemed to take the rest of the morning! <br />
        After lunch I looked at options for the two accounts that need reinvesting while Angela worked in the garden. Then I made a start on pruning the top of a yew bush.</p>
        <p>7 September 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>This morning, after a walk to the newsagents, I built a test structure for covering and then watched a couple of videos on covering and read the notes with the Solartex roll.<br />
        After lunch we searched the Forces War Records database for Angela's grandfather and then went over to Dad's. I cut his grass while Angela trimmed his hydrangea bush so that he could get through his side gate. She also turned his bed clothes over. When we got home we had a short chat with Victoria and Austin.</p>
        <p>8 September 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Angela was helping at the lunch club today, so the rest of us went to Steyning and on to the playground at Fletchers Croft for a picnic lunch. When we got home I started covering my test structure and then went round to Bay's to look at her tax return figures.</p>
        <p>9 September 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>We spent the day looking after Rowan while Paul and Krista went to Colliers Wood and Twickenham. We walked her down to Steyning this morning, had our main meal at lunchtime and went to Worthing this afternoon. We bought sausages for lunch and followed them with apple crumble and custard. We then dropped Angela at Worthing Hospital to go to her appointment at the ENT department, parked near the Aquarina and went to the playground near Splashpoint. We also went on to the beach, where Rowan collected two pockets full of stones and shells!<br />
        We just got home in time for me to leave for my IET committee meeting. However, Rowan did not want to get out of her car seat and I left with her lying on the floor screaming!</p>
        <p>10 September 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>I really did think about going to the flying site, but things got in the way. Angela, Paul, Rowan and I went blackberry picking. So we had a blackberry and apple crumble in the evening. Rowan slept for over two hours after lunch, so I was able to update my RC blog and send an e-mail to Jane at L3-Link. I also made a foam case for the receiver.</p>
        <p>11 September 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We all had a lie-in this morning and so were late setting off to do the weekly shop. Being late after calling into Dad's, we started with a cup of coffee in M&amp;S. After a late lunch we went to Bay's and I checked her tax form. Later, Rowan helped me pick raspberries and a few runner beans. No progress on my model today.</p>
        <p>12 September 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I had intended going to the flying site this afternoon and even charged the batteries this morning. However, when the time came it just seemed like too much effort. I went to the dentist this morning and found that a tooth that had broken needed a cap. He prepared it there and then a put a temporary cap in place! Although I managed to complete the dis-assembly of my model (in preparation for its final fill/sand and covering) the rest of the day was really only spent entertaining Rowan. But Paul et al have sorted out their rented flat in the Netherlands and booked their ferry.</p>
        <p>13 September 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>When we walked to the newsagents this morning, Paul et al went off to Brighton to meet up with some friends. So we had the rest of the day to ourselves, at least until 5 o'clock when they returned. However, most of the day seemed to be spent on financial elated activities; doing the weekly accounts, including checking a bank statement; reinvesting a maturing bond and moving some money from one current account to another.<br />
        After tea we took Bay to the Music Society concert. The Schumann and Schubert pieces were good, but the modern piece was a collection of snatches of tune and miscellaneous noises! </p>
        <p>14 September 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>This morning P et al went to Glen's and picked up Dad on the way back. Meanwhile, following our usual walk to the newsagents, I cooked lunch and then picked up Bay. The rest of the day was then spent eating and being entertained by Rowan before I took them home after tea.</p>
        <p>15 September 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today P et al went to Winchester to meet (half way) their friends from Devon. So we had most of the day to ourselves. Well, Angela had a WI meeting this afternoon and I went to Dad's to change his bed and put on his washing! Anyway, we eat alone, then Angela did her WI accounts and I watched the second instalment of 'Our Zoo'. Earlier I had thought of going to the flying site, but, although the weather was perfect, it was quite late and I was tired. But at least I was home to help cook dinner.</p>
        <p>16 September 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>After a gentle start, we took Rowan down to Steyning. Angela went to the bank while we went to the cricket ground playground. We then went on to the Star to meet Paul and Krista for lunch. We sat out in huge garden and had a good meal, finally getting home in time for a cup of tea.<br />
        I did manage to remove some 'dings' on my model and painted the inside of the cockpit black, even though the real planes are painted yellow.<br />
        Then I spent some time creating a new partition on my laptop and copying my Document folders into it. I set up the mounting of the partition, but now just need to delete the original files and bind the folders to my Home equivalents.</p>
        <p>17 September 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Today was the day that we got our house back! This morning Paul packed his car at 12:30, after a light lunch, they set off for Dover. We then had our lunch and Angela went to table tennis. I decided that it was too windy to go flying and so I downloaded photos, finished setting up the data partition on my laptop and completed filling/sanding my model. I also started fixing the covering fillets at the base of the fin. Krista sent us a text to say that they were about to board the ferry.</p>
        <p>18 September 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>I did a little work on covering my plane before we set off to collect Bay and Dad and take them to Chichester, where we saw Guys &amp; Dolls. We all enjoyed it and were home quite late.</p>
        <p>19 September 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>The weekly shop was moved to today due to our trip yesterday to Chichester. We were home at about one o'clock to get our lunch, after which Angela took Bay's shopping to her while I covered the bottom of the fuselage of my model. I tried updating the OS on the iPad, but there was a communications problem and it failed. When Angela got back (at about 4:30) I packed up my things and went to the flying site. I had one good landing, one bumpy landing and one landing just short of the strip. However, I did my first loops! They are actually easier than landing. I was late home, since everyone (about six people) all left together just before seven.</p>
        <p>20 September 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Angela made her yearly journey to Guildford to meet up with Carol and June. She set off at about eleven, after we had walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper (and deliver a cake to Jenny). So I did the weekly accounts, covered some of the fuselage of my model and rubbed down the door surrounds in the hall (in addition to reading some of the paper). Also update the OS on the iPad.</p>
        <p>21 September 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following our usual walk to Beeding newsagents this morning, Angela went to church and I worked on covering the fuselage of my model. I no just need to cover the fin, shink it all and then cut the covering from the windows. I also downloaded the latest ISO image for Mint, but the installation options are not straightforward.<br />
        After a longish lunch Angela cut the back grass while I cut down some more of the yew bush. We then spoke to Victoria and Austin and then I cut the front grass while Angela prepared dinner.</p>
        <p>22 September 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I finished covering the tailplane and fin of my model and then went over the whole fuselage with the iron at a higher temperature to shrink the covering. It worked quite well. Then I cut the covering from the windows and started covering the elevator. In between I went to the dentist to have a cap fitted.<br />
        After lunch we went to Bay's to replace a battery in a smoke detector, only to find that Mick the gardener had done it for her! Then we went to Tesco to get some petrol before going on to Dad's to change is bed and clean around a bit.</p>
        <p>23 September 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning I went to the flying field. Two people were there already and three or four arrived later, including Alan. I had a few flights and did some more loops, but did not manage a good landing. Steve crashed a new model on its first flight!<br />
        After lunch, while Angela took Baytown the chiropodist, I covered the elevators and started on the rudder. Then I went to Crawley for an IET meeting on detecting particles in space.</p>
        <p>24 September 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>While Angela worked in the garden and went to Steyning, I covered the rudder and the battery hatch on my model. Unfortunately, I don't have enough Solartex to cover the wings, so will need to buy another 2m roll!<br />
        After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I walked down to Beeding and had my hair cut. I then finished rubbing down the woodwork and radiator in the hall.</p>
        <p>25 September 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again! But we managed to get back to Dad's fairly early. After lunch Angela went to Bay's as usual and I worked on my model. I fitted the elevator and rudder (as well as the undercarriage legs and tail wheel leg). I'm not convinced that the hinges are stuck over their full depth.</p>
        <p>26 September 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning was Angela's McMillan coffee morning. I helped put out the tables and put up the bunting. And then put it all away again at the end. Otherwise I spent most of the time hearing Ron's life story' but Angela managed to make nearly &#163;200.<br />
        After lunch I painted the hall ceiling.</p>
        <p>27 September 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Following the usual walk to the newsagents in Beeding, I spent most of the day undercoating woodwork in the hall.</p>
        <p>28 September 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A repeat of yesterday! However, I did finish undercoating the woodwork.</p>
        <p>29 September 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I put back the doors in the hall, including trimming some wood off the top of the airing cupboard door. We then went into Worthing, calling at banks and having some lunch in Debenhams. Then we went to Dad's via the model shop and Currys. There we changed his bed and put his washing on.<br />
        Whilst trying to sort out the use of the SD dare in my phone, Paul called via Hangouts, since their internet connection had been installed.</p>
        <p>30 September 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today was all about covering the walls with a coat of Basecoat. As usual, it took longer than I thought, but it was done by dinner time. Angela had her pre-check at Southlands, prior to having her new ear grommets fitted.</p>
