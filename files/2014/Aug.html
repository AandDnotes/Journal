        <p>1 August 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A day of two parts. After a shower, I spent most of the morning ordering the parts for my model. For some reason, HobbyKing, via PayPal, refused my credit card and then charged more than they had quoted as I added items to my basket! Both GiantShark and GreatBest accepted the card, the latter via PayPal. Angela was out most of the morning.<br />
        After lunch we went in the garden and I trimmed the top of the laurel and the bush behind it.</p>
        <p>2 August 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After the usual walk to the Beeding newsagents I spent most of the morning doing the weekly and monthly accounts. After lunch, actually quite late, we walked up to the flying site, since it is the fun weekend today and tomorrow. It was mostly over, but after watching a couple of flights and having a cup of tea we walked home via the South Downs Way, past the pig farm.</p>
        <p>3 August 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After the usual Sunday morning walk to Barmber and while Angela went to church, I sorted out photos from my phone, editing them where necessary. Then an early lunch and a trip to Paul's. We took Connie home, heard about their trip to Norway (and saw their photos) and then went out for dinner. The only point that disrupted our journey was Oxshot being closed and needing to take a long diversion. We came back via Kingston and got a little lost, but ended up on the right road in Surbiton, more by luck. It was 10:35 before we were home.</p>
        <p>4 August 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We were not particularly early this morning and I have not felt quite right all day. Later in the morning we went over to Dad's to change his bed and do his washing. We also did a little pruning in the garden. After lunch I found a guide to covering a model with film.</p>
        <p>5 August 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today revolved around going out for lunch. We were the only people who remembered our wedding anniversary; 42 years. We went to the Chardonnay restaurant at Washington and had a good meal that lasted from one o'clock until three. The rest of the day was mainly spent reading the paper or researching model covering techniques.</p>
        <p>6 August 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Angela went walking this morning, while I started on my redesign of the strip board version of the plane module. Then my parts arrived from HobbyKing. After lunch we went to B&amp;Q to get some golf ball light bulbs. Then on the model shop to get some minor bits to help putting the power and RC bits together. Then I started looking at how I can mount the motor in the right position.</p>
        <p>7 August 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day (with a slight difference). Dad wanted to buy some new trousers, having split his favourite pair. So he came with us to M&amp;S, but they had nothing of the type he wanted. So we did the food shopping and tried to take Dad home. However, the traffic was bad, so we came back to Steyning for lunch, then took his food to his house before taking him into Worthing to Jolliemans, where he found some trousers. We then had a walk along the sea-front, past the new swimming pool, having an ice cream on the way. I think this was the first time that Dad told us that his dad was in the Household Cavalry in the First World War, riding horses to pull guns. Dad said that Granddad's brother was with him and was shot while they were riding side by side. Granddad had to push him off the horse so as to prevent them crashing.<br />
        While Angela went round to Bay's, I started making a test rig for my motor before cooking dinner.</p>
        <p>8 August 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>An overcast, but warm and calm start to the day. So I went up to the flying site and used up the remains of my glo-fuel. Some good, but mainly bouncy landings. Two people had already been to the site (I arrived just after ten) and three arrived before I left, so I did not need to either take down the electric fence or put it back.<br />
        After lunch I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's, to buy her lunch club food, while I went to the model shop to pick the two propellers that I had ordered, plus some bolts to fix the motor to a test rig. We then took the food to the church kitchen.<br />
        I mounted the motor on my test rig, but need some larger diameter heat-shrink tube before I can solder the connectors to the power cables.</p>
        <p>9 August 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We walked down to the roundabout twice this morning, once to go to the newsagents and then again to catch the number 3 bus to Horsham. We arrived just after midday, had lunch in front of the bandstand, where a brass band was playing. We were home by 3:30. Then Angela cut the grass while I did the weekly accounts (and reconciled it against the bank statement).</p>
        <p>10 August 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After a walk to Beeding newsagents, I spent most of the day working on tax again. I found all Angela's sources of interest and then produced an estimate of my 2013/14 tax liability. Registering for self assessment proved to be more difficult!</p>
        <p>11 August 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>I had a fairly early appointment with the Doctor this morning, to review my arrhythmia medication. She only took my blood pressure and asked if the medication was controlling the spasms. So it did not take long. After walking home, I went to Dad's to change his bed and cut his grass. But it rained whilst there! However, since he still had no appointment to go back to the maxilo-facial unit about his biopsy, I made an appointment for him with the nurse to remove his stitches.<br />
        I called by the model shop on the way home to get some heat-shrink tubing and a connector. I should have bought the small tubing since I need to part shrink it before I use it so that is goes into the recess in the connector. Before doing any soldering I drew up the power connections.<br />
        Meanwhile, Angela was cooking at the lunch club. When she got home we walked down to Steyning to get some bread for tea. Then I removed the crocodile clips from the charger lead and soldered on an XT60 connector.</p>
        <p>12 August 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today was a major step forward for my model. I completed soldering connectors to the parts, including cutting off the bullet connectors on the ESC and soldering on ones that fit those on the motor. Then I charged one of the LiPo batteries and connected it all together. And it all worked! However, the power and signal wires from the receiver to the BEC output on the ESC go through a switch. When I turn this off, the motor starts and runs for a few seconds. Tomorrow I need to look at the ESC settings or try switching only the power wires and not the signal wire.<br />
        This morning Angela went to a WI meeting and this afternoon she went to a WI quiz event.</p>
        <p>13 August 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A relatively early start to take Dad to the Eye Clinic at Worthing hospital for a nine o'clock appointment. He has some inflammation at the back of his eye which could be due to the cataract operation or could be wet macular degeneration. He has two sets of eye drops to take for the next four weeks, but will need to go back in two weeks. They will then decide whether or not he needs injections in his eye to try to convert the wet MD to the dry form. When we got back to his house I compiled his shopping list and filled his pill box. Meanwhile, Angela was walking with her WI group.<br />
        After lunch we went off to do the weekly shop; a day early since Angela is out tomorrow. We got back to Dad's while he was at the surgery to have his biopsy stitches removed!<br />
        I used the programming box for my ESC to reset it to the factory settings. It then seemed to work as expected. I also researched the storage of LiPo batteries and put the charged battery through the charger's 'storage' program to reduce the voltage to about half charge. It seemed to want to reduce the voltage to 11.1V, although the recommendation seems to be 11.55V for a 3S battery. It took a long time, so I stopped it at 11.4V.</p>
        <p>14 August 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Angela left mid-morning to go to Borde Hill Garden. But heavy rain stopped them from going in the garden, so they just had lunch! Meanwhile I updated my blog.and started adapting the engine mount on my plane. Just before dinner I walked to Mark Sylvester's house to buy some fuel.</p>
        <p>15 August 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>In spite of it being a bit breezy, I went up to the flying field this morning. I got there at ten and left at 12:30. Luckily Derek arrived just as I was packing up. He had a 50 year old model and the RC gear that went with it. He had refurbished the equipment and bought a vintage engine on eBay. I only made one good landing during all the time that I was trying!<br />
        After lunch I completed the modified motor mount for my model.</p>
        <p>16 August 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Being Saturday, we started with a walk to the Beeding newsagents. Angela then went to a church coffee morning while I had a piano practice and did the weekly accounts. Then I started installing the motor, ESC and receiver switch. After lunch we both went into the garden and pruned. Angela pruned back the rose on the trellis and I attacked the lilac.</p>
        <p>17 August 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Walk to the newsagent in Beeding. Then a relaxing day reading the paper and modifying the motor mount on my model so that the cowl would fit.<br />
        We had a guided tour of Victoria's new home.</p>
        <p>18 August 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>In the morning we collected Bay's old microwave, loaded our old Dyson and pieces of wood from the garden into the car and went to the tip in Shoreham. We then called into Dunelm Mill before going to Dad's. There we changed his bed, put on his washing and cut his grass. We also trimmed his prickly bush near his shed.<br />
        After lunch I trimmed the cowl, cut holes in it and fitted it to the fuselage.</p>
        <p>19 August 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Late this morning Angela caught the bus to Worthing. So I had a quiet day working on my model and researching prop balancing. I spent a lot of my time making one of the wing struts, although I did start making the other one. However, I did spend quite a lot of time trying to get the thin CA nozzle out of the cap!</p>
        <p>20 August 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning I went to the flying field. Someone (Paul) was already there, although I was flying first. Then Andrew and then Steve came along. I made a couple of good landings and a few bouncy ones! Meanwhile, Angela went walking.<br />
        After an early lunch, Mark Perry called to look at the 'green goo'. He looked at quite a few power points and found no residue. Then only three light switches and one light rose showed signs of green. The study, for some reason seems to be the worse. Mark's recommendation is to simply check the switches periodically, to clean the wires/switches/roses (or replace the switches and roses) when we decorate a room.<br />
        Then I completed the second wing strut and started looking at the installation of the servos and linkages to control surfaces.<br />
        Just before Angela put our dinner in the oven, Bay phoned to say that she had defrosted her freezer, but did not now have the strength to put the food back. So we walked round there, put the food back in her freezer and walked home before we cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>21 August 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again. We started with a quick visit to Dad to get his list and then we went off to Holmebush. Following coffee in M&amp;S we did the shopping and returned to Dad. After lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her while I worked on my model. I worked out the servo movement (and found that one of the three servos that I have bought does not have symmetrical movement) and modified the mount so as to take the smaller servos.</p>
        <p>22 August 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>The only work on my model today was to re-do the calculations of torque requirements for the servos. I was concerned that the servos that I bought were too small. However, in spite of their small size, they seem to have ten time the necessary torque.<br />
        After that, I started stripping wallpaper from the hall. Angela helped when she returned from Steyning, where she had her hair cut. I had to drain the radiator so as to take it off the wall. I had papered behind it.</p>
        <p>23 August 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After our usual Saturday morning walk to Beeding to buy a paper we finished stripping the paper from the hall walls. Then we made some lunch and caught the bus to Shoreham. There was a beer festival on the spot where we thought we could sit and eat our lunch, so we walked across the footbridge and onto the beach, where we sat on a seat and had lunch. We then walked along to Shoreham Fort before heading back on the other side of Shoreham Beach. It was quite a long way and we got back to the High Street five minutes before the bus home. So we missed out on a cup of tea!<br />
        After our cup of et at home, Angela went in the Garden and I fixed the control horns in place and started work on the pushrods for the elevator and rudder.</p>
        <p>24 August 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After our Sunday morning walk to the newsagent Angela went to church and I worked on my model. I completed the elevator pushrod and then made the rudder pushrod. However, I think that by raising the servos (so as to fit the smaller servos) I do not now have enough space for the pushrods to pass down the fuselage.<br />
        After lunch we went over to Dad's to change his bed and cut down some bushes in the garden. When we got back, we spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>25 August 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today was a bank holiday, so we had a relaxing day! That was helped by the fact that it rained all day. Angela made some plum jam and I took down the light and smoke detector in the hall and washed the ceiling. I also caught up with a number of e-mail, volunteering for some STEM events and sending a summary to the ISA 106 committee. We also heard that Paul and Krista are having their furniture packed on Thursday!</p>
        <p>26 August 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>My intent was to cut the two slots for pushrods in the fuselage of my model and then start filling cracks in huge walls of the hall. However, I spent all morning working on my plane! The servos were too high (after modifying the plate to hold the smaller servos), so I firstly had to modify the plate. Then I found that the pushrod rubs against the side of the hole through the formers. I had to bend the wire so as to create clearance. However, every modification requires taking off the Clovis and withdrawing the pushrod, then putting it all back again.<br />
        After lunch (we had dinner at lunch time) we went over to Dad's to take him to the Eye Clinic. While we spent an hour and a quarter in the hospital, Angela went into Worthing to do the M&amp;S shopping.</p>
        <p>27 August 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent filling and sanding the walls in the hall. Otherwise I looked at tax codings and put chairs and kitchen appliances in the car ready to take to Paul's tomorrow. Angela went walking this morning and had coffee with Val and Mel this afternoon.</p>
        <p>28 August 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We had an early start, getting up at 5:30 and driving to Twickenham. However, it took two hours! We spent most of the day looking after Rowan while Krista supervised the removal men packing their belongings. We left at four and got home at 6:15! Rowan was very good all day and eat most of her meal and went to bed quietly.</p>
        <p>29 August 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Angela did not have a good night, so Krista and I did the weekly shop, with assistance from Rowan. We got home a little after one o'clock and made some lunch. After spending some time in the garden with Rowan, Angela took Bay her shopping (and did a few errands). Meanwhile I checked the savings account with Shawbrook, Rowan had a nap and I fitted the second pushrod to my model.</p>
        <p>30 August 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We set off a little before 10:30 to take Krista and Rowan back to Twickenham, arriving at about 12:15. Paul had bought some lunch, which we ate in the park, then Angela and I took Rowan to the playground while Paul and Krista did some cleaning. We spent a long time in the playground, but still could not get Rowan to leave. In the end I had to carry her screaming across the park! After a bit of a tantrum she settled down and Paul and I went off to the tip, to buy some picnic food and to a charity shop. When we got back, their friends were already gathering in the park. By the time that we left (about 5:15) there was quite a collection of parents and children. We got home just after seven.</p>
        <p>31 August 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Angela and I walked to the newsagents this morning while P et al had breakfast. I then did the weekly and monthly accounts. After a picnic lunch in the garden we walked up to the pig farm to show Rowan the pigs. After dinner we made the mistake of leaving the kitchen door open. Connie helped herself to the remains of a roast chicken that we planned to have for dinner tomorrow!</p>
