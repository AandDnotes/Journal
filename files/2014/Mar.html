        <p>1 March 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Our usual walk to the newsagents at Beeding was followed by reading the paper!<br />
        I then started coding my revised design for the RC ground station.<br />
        After lunch we went to Bay's to assemble her new bird table. This took more effort than I thought it would. Angela also spent more time unblocking Bay's paper shredder than she expected. Having assembled the bird table I put it in place and hammered in the wire hoops that we had bought. Surprisingly they did not hit chalk or flints. We also changed a light bulb and disposed of the old bird table.</p>
        <p>2 March 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After another walk to Beeding (and reading of the paper), I set out to do some practice flying. However, there was a new version of the simulation software, which took a long time to install. It does seem better, even though the planes respond differently. They now seem to be more like the real thing!<br />
        I then did the weekly and monthly accounts.<br />
        After lunch I completed the coding of the revised ground station software, but have yet to try compiling it.</p>
        <p>3 March 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I compiled my revised ground station code and got it working with the state model based plane software. But the string of receive timeouts remains. However, I found that the number of timeouts is equal to the maximum errors on the plane unit and it seems that a receive timeout on the plane is causing repeated timeouts until the ground station re-initialises.<br />
        After an early lunch I went to Dad's to help him change his bed. I then went on to George Turnbull's to meet with him and Hamish to discuss the planned IET industry meeting in Crawley.<br />
        This evening I started redesigning the plane software in the same style as the revised ground station.</p>
        <p>4 March 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Where did today go? I started by downloading '12 Years a Slave' in the form of a Kindle book, from Amazon, using a Daily Mail voucher. As part of this I had to download the Kindle app.<br />
        I had worked out a possible scenario that would result in the problem that I was seeing with my RC software. And I found the problem. I was aborting receive mode when I should not have been! So I had the new design on the ground and the old design on the plane, but still with quite a lot of single receive timeouts on the ground. So I completed the design and coding for the plane with the new design that does not use interrupts. However, I am now getting some transmit errors on the plane that result in a receive timeout and a cycle time of up to 37ms. There also seems to be an occasional glitch of the servos.<br />
        Angela went to her table tennis club lunch today and had a good time.<br />
        After lunch I started reading the papers for Friday's DAG meeting.</p>
        <p>5 March 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>I spent a good part of the morning looking at the DAG accounts to see if there are any important trends. But consistent and complete data is scant. However, I have a graph of annual values and later finished reading the documents.<br />
        After lunch I took Bay to the Health Centre to have more skin removed from her nose. I had to leave her there and then go back for her. Angela walked up there after her table tennis.<br />
        I had a call from Lee at Bohen, who hopes to have the information I requested to us some time tomorrow.<br />
        I also fixed the remaining problem with the plane software, but the diagnostics are not doing what I intended.</p>
        <p>6 March 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We started, as usual on a Thursday, by going to Dad's and then on to Tesco and Marks.<br />
        After lunch I looked some more at the DAG documents and then Angela took Bay's food to her while I worked on my RC software. But Angela had forgotten to take Bay's flowers to her, so I took them on around on foot.<br />
        After that I modified some code and thought that I had reduced the number of receive timeouts. But there are still too many on the ground station.</p>
        <p>7 March 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A relatively busy day. It started with a DAG meeting at Brighton. Even though it didn't start until ten, it meant leaving at 9:15. I was back just after 12:30, so lunch was at about the usual time.<br />
        During the afternoon I raised the power on my RC units and tried moving them apart. With the ground unit in the study I took the plane further away and recorded the two received signal strengths. Going to the far side of the front bedroom caused the signal to be lost! I put the ground unit on the study window sill and took the plane down the garden. It reached the bottom (about 45m), but dropped when I went behind the tree. With line of sight it is supposed to manage a kilometre.<br />
        After dinner I went to the flying club meeting at Lancing Leisure Centre. There were a lot of people there, including Les andDerek, and some good displays. I made a number of notes.</p>
        <p>8 March 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We had an early start this morning. By 8:40 we were heading for Paul's. After a good journey, a cup of coffee and a look at details of the house they had seen in the New Forest, we set out to walk to Richmond along the river. There we went into an Italian restaurant and had quite a good meal; for Krista's birthday. Then we walked back, taking a shorter route, but still avoiding the main road. Rowan went to sleep about half way back. We then sat, drank tea, looked at details of the house that they had seen in Holland and played with Rowan once she woke. After some tea we left at about 7:20 and got home by 8:45. </p>
        <p>9 March 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A usual Sunday morning: a walk to the newsagents; the weekly accounts that I forgot to do yesterday; some piano practice (it is a step change when you start to move out of the middle two octaves); and a little work on my RC software. However, after lunch I took my plane up to the flying site. It was crowded. I only managed two flights, since the nose wheel is still turning!</p>
        <p>10 March 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning we loaded the car with items for the tip (although I forgot to put in the old electric blanket) and headed to Dad's to pick up his old microwave. He phoned before we left to say that John and Laura were planning to call this morning and they were there when we arrived. Once they had left we turned his bed cloths around and set off to the tip.<br />
        After lunch Angela went into the garden and I cut the back grass. It was very long in places and so it was quite hard work. Then we had a call from Bay about her burglar alarm, so we walked round there and tried to disable it. But it doesn't let you! I disconnected the battery as suggested by the technician that Bay had spoken to when the alarm went off during a power cut. But now, if there is another power cut, there will be no way to enter the code to silence it!<br />
        Had a call from the Brighton donations telephone team. Arranged for the two existing donations (&#163;15 per quarter and &#163;10 per month) to be cancelled and a new donation of &#163;20 per month to be set up from April 1st. This is to the unrestricted alumni and friends fund.</p>
        <p>11 March 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning just seemed to disappear. We ate at lunch time since I went to Crawley this evening for an IET programme sub-committee meeting. So some time was spent trying to work out where to go. During the afternoon I modified the main program on both the ground station and the plane so as to try to get them to recover from communication loss.<br />
        The IET meeting was interesting and I picked up a couple of actions to pursue possible talks.</p>
        <p>12 March 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Dad's appointment at Southlands was postponed, so we just spent the morning doing the weekly shop. We had to bring forward our weekly shop since we need to take Bay to Haywards Heath tomorrow to have the stitches removed from her nose. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I did some more work on my RC software. I currently have two problems; the power of the transmission is low, so the range is short. I made some changes and took both units into the garden, but only managed 20 meters. At the weekend I took the plane unit to the bottom of the garden (with the ground station on the study window sill) before the communications failed.<br />
        We then took Bay's shopping to her and I replaced the connections to her burglar alarm battery.</p>
        <p>13 March 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We had a good day out today. We needed to take Bay to Haywards Heath to get her stitches removed. We were early (her appointment was at midday) but they called her in ten minutes early and she was out by ten past. So we went off to Wakehurst Place, had lunch outside and then walked around the grounds. Actually I pushed her in the wheelchair. We stopped for a cup of tea and a piece of cake before returning home.</p>
        <p>14 March 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela went to a funeral while I experimented with varying the length of a monopole antenna. But I think that the two units must have been too close, since there was really no difference as I shortened the antenna. After that, Angela cut the front grass while I checked Bay's tax. I now need to see if she put the right figures on her tax return. This morning, after a late start, I did the accounts and checked the latest bank statement.<br />
        Earlier this morning I talked to Sam Davis about the interviews to take place in a couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>15 March 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We made a relatively early start (08:45) to Victoria's this morning, arriving at about 10:30. They were still at the supermarket when we arrived! So we sat in the car reading the paper. When they came home we played with Austin, indoors and in the garden, until lunch. We had planned to take them out, but Brandon had eaten out all wee so cooked steak on his barbecue. They were very good. Then we went for a walk, ending up at the garden centre for a cup of tea. We walked back via the park and then played some more before cheese and biscuits and a drive home. We left at five past seven and arrived home at about 9:45.<br />
        Austin was on very good form. Luckily they had decided to accept the offer on their house from the couple who are renting and have a mortgage arranged, even though someone else had offered more.</p>
        <p>16 March 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the newsagent in Beeding. Then I downloaded photos and video from yesterday. It took a while to put the video clips together, including rotating clips where I had turned the camera to get a better shot!<br />
        After lunch we went to the garden centre at Findon and then on to Dad's. Whilst there I cut the grass and Angela helped change his bed and vacuumed.<br />
        As we arrived home so Paul called for our weekly chat.</p>
        <p>17 March 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>I got a fast response from Gary Williams following my request for him to give a talk to the IET on cyber security.<br />
        This afternoon, while Angela went to her WI meeting, I went to have a word with John and Sandy. John agreed to give a talk to the IET and we talked about their kitchen. Then I spent a long time with Bay, going through her tax numbers.</p>

        Thursday</p>
        <p>Travelled to Northamptonshire to visit Dick and Kate.<br />
        After lunch we went into Northampton to visit the museum.</p>
        <p>21 March 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>After a late breakfast we went to the Cotswolds. We started by looking at a stone circle and then moved on to Castletown House. We had a glass or two of wine, toured the house and then had a picnic! In spite of the chilly wind.</p>
        <p>22 March 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After a late breakfast we travelled home from Badby via Claydon House in Buckinghamshire. We arrived home just before five o'clock.</p>
        <p>23 March 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The usual walk to Beeding newsagent was followed by catching up with weekend jobs such as accounts. I also drafted letters to the Inland Revenue for Bay. However, we did spend rather longer than usual watching the TV after lunch!</p>
        <p>24 March 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning we went into Worthing to try to get a replacement SIM for my phone and get a few other things. The operator Three (suggested by John ?) could not get their SIM to work in my phone, but Carphone Warehouse got a Talkmobile pay-as-you-go SIM to work. Angela bought some waterproof over-trousers and I bought some walking socks.<br />
        After some lunch in Waitrose I called into the model shop. They said that my kit has been shipped and so should be here shortly.<br />
        We then went to Howdens to finalise the details of the new kitchen before going on to Dad's.</p>
        <p>25 March 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A day off. I spent most of the day working on my RC equipment. I re-read a lot of posts from Dunk and my own notes. Then I made the code consistent between the two units. This seemed to result in good reception throughout the house (it was raining outside). However, the receive timeouts are still occurring, even at one meter apart, although at a rate that is below what I have read is obtainable.<br />
        I made a start on building a folded dipole antenna.<br />
        In the evening I read the applications for the Insight manager's job at Brighton and watched the second instalment of the Johnny Worriker trilogy.</p>
        <p>26 March 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>My first attempt at soldering the coax cables for the folded dipole was unsuccessful. The heat from the soldering iron probably melted the insulation. The second attempt was more successful and I built the antenna, but I needed a connector. So after lunch I went to Maplins to get some SMA connectors. I also went to B&amp;Q and bought a 13A double socket for Dad.<br />
        Then I went to Dad's to fit the socket, fill his pill box and compile his shopping list. When I returned, Angela had not returned from Bay's (after table tennis Angela picked up her plate from the dentist), so I went round there to help her get away!</p>
        <p>27 March 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again, and back on Thursday. We were able to go straight to Tesco since I collected Dad's list yesterday. After lunch Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and did not get back until after 6:30! She spent a long time trying to find Bay's new blue badge, but failed.<br />
        I tested the RSSI for the two antennae types that I had built. I put the 'plane' on the patio bench and walked the laptop and ground station down the garden, recording the values as I went. The wire dipoles would easily go anywhere in the garden, but the coax dipoles would not go beyond the birch trees! I also started fixing an SMA plug on the folded dipole.<br />
        I spent part of the afternoon reading the papers for the interviews tomorrow.</p>
        <p>28 March 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning I was collected by Sam Davis at 8:15! She drove me to the Edward Street building prior to going to Grand Parade to do the interviews for their Insight Manager.<br />
        We discovered that our telephone land line had stopped working. I did the basic tests and then reported the fault.</p>
        <p>29 March 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning, after walking to the Beeding newsagents, completing the folded dipole. However, it's performance was worse than the other two antennae types that I have built. After lunch I cut the grass in the back garden. During this, the BT man came, diagnosed the problem and found a broken wire between here and the first green box.</p>
        <p>30 March 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After another walk to the newsagents I spent a lot of the morning doing the weekly accounts, researching more about tax and updating Bay's tax estimate.<br />
        This afternoon I discovered that my folded dipole has a short between the active element (loop) and the shield, did some research on folded dipole antenna design and started building another version.<br />
        As usual, we spoke to both Paul (who had Krista's parents and brother with them) and Victoria (who had been playing at a concert this afternoon).</p>
        <p>31 March 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>It was about 10:30 by the time that got to Dad's this morning. We went armed with loppers and secateurs so as to cut down some of the growth in his garden. So after changing his bed and putting on his washing we went into the garden. He came out to help, but it was a bit too much for him.<br />
        After a late lunch Angela went to the library and to church to cut down more shrubs. Meanwhile, I made another folded dipole antenna (without a short this time) and ran some range tests. It did not perform quite as well as my wire dipole, so I built another wire dipole that I can gradually trim to see what is the optimum length. In the process I discovered that the short in my original folded dipole was at the plug. Unfortunately I had already cut off the loop and balun by this time!<br />
        I also tried flying a quad copter and a helicopter on the simulator. The quad copter was easy, but the heli was impossible!</p>
