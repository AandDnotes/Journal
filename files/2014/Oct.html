        <p>1 October 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A very early start this morning; the alarm was set for 6 o'clock! This meant, of course, that I could not sleep last night. The early start was due to a STEM event at St Paul's primary school. Angela dropped me at Shoreham station and I caught the train into Brighton. It was then only a five minute walk to the school. Overall the day was good, but very tiring.</p>
        <p>2 October 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again! However, we were quite early, so had time for a coffee in M&amp;S and we're still home in time for lunch. After lunch, while Angela went to Bay's, I replaced the hall radiator, scanned a bank statement and sent it to Krista, moved some money between Dad's Santander accounts and researched travel to Krimpen aan de Lek. Train all the way is slightly faster, but costs twice as much as flying!</p>

        Friday</p>
        <p>We were a quarter of an hour late leaving home this morning, so we were just a little later than planned arriving at Dick and Kate's in Badby. However, we had a fairly late lunch and then walked around their village in the sunshine, while Kate delivered her WI newsletters.</p>
        <p>4 October 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After a relatively late breakfast we set off in the rain from Badby to Hidcote Manor gardens over in Gloucestershire. Luckily the rain had stopped by the time that we arrived. We had lunch there and then moved on to a Roman villa excavation closer to Cirencester. All together we had a good day, with Dick doing quite a lot of driving. We got back to Badby quite late and then prepared dinner.</p>
        <p>5 October 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>We had expected to leave for home after breakfast. However, Kate suggested that we all went into Daventry for a walk around the lake and then have ham, egg and chips on our return before we departed. So it was 2:15 before we left Badby and just after five before we got home. We only stopped to pick up a paper from a service station on the M40. Just as we came through the door so the iPad made a noise. Both Paul and Victoria had been trying to contact us. After some abortive attempts we spoke to both.</p>
        <p>6 October 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A good part of the day was spent researching and booking our travel to Rotterdam. I booked the flights and the trains to/from London. I now just need to establish if we can use the Oyster cards that Victoria and Brandon left behind. Prior to making travel arrangements I did the weekly and monthly accounts, including updating our dividend record, and then finished reading the documents for tomorrow's DAG meeting.<br />
        There was heavy rain from quite early, so I did not go to Dad's, but phoned him instead.<br />
        I also fitted the second pushrod and then the motor/ESC and receiver in the fuselage, prior to checking the lateral balance again. Then I can try covering the wings.</p>
        <p>7 October 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Another busy day. This morning I finished putting the parts back in the fuselage of my model. Then I went to Brighton to the DAG meeting. I gave June Crown a lift to the station on my way home. I got home at about 2:30 and then applied for our ESTAs before going to Crawley for the IET AGM and a talk on MRI scanners. Only four members of the committee turned up (late) and so we held the AGM standing up in the Spotlight room (with a couple of members lurking in the background). The new committee member, S, volunteered to take on the secretary job. The talk on MRI scanners was excellent. We had over 50 attendees, including a group from a school in Surrey.<br />
        Today I had two sets of sandwiches, one at the DAG and one at the IET meeting!</p>
        <p>8 October 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>After checking the lateral balance of my model, I took Dad to Southlands to see Dr Ali in the dermatology department. More treatment! However, we were finished quite early. After lunch I walked round to Bay's to talk about her tax return. Meanwhile, Angela went to table tennis.</p>
        <p>9 October 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>I had made both Dad's and Bay's shopping lists yesterday, so we were able to go off a little earlier to do the weekly shop.<br />
        After lunch, while Angela took Bay's shopping to her, I made a start on trying to fit the windshield to my plane using transparent book covering. I didn't get very far, since I was also progressing my laptop update, which took most of my time. I eventually wrote the image to DVD and booted it, only to find that it did not connect to the wi-fi or a cable. However, after cleaning out the gutters, some of which were full of sycamore seeds, I installed Mint 17 from the DVD.</p>
        <p>10 October 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Today Angela started by going to Steyning and then going shopping for Monday's lunch club. That net that we had to dice some quite nice looking pork. While Angela was out, I went to the hygienist and then added the automatic mounting of my data partition to the Linux Mint installation. I also installed Inkscape and downloaded the latest versions of Fritzing and the Arduino IDE. After lunch we took some of the food (and other things) to the church and then took Bay to Curry's to buy a new vacuum cleaner.</p>
        <p>11 October 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>It seemed like we spent the day taking Bay places. Although we only took her for her flu jab in the morning and to the Music Society fundraising event in the evening. We also had our flu jabs. The evening was a chorus and some soloists singing the songs from the Pirates of Penzance. It was an entertaining evening.<br />
        I also installed the Arduino IDE and Fritzing.</p>
        <p>12 October 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following our usual walk to the newsagents I started looking at UEFI interfaces for booting a selected OS. I also put the wheels on my model and started preparing the wing for covering. After lunch we then went to Dad's so that I could put the second application of gel on the spots on his head and we could change his bed and do his washing. Later we spoke firstly to Victoria and then to Paul. After dinner I also spoke to Alan, who hopes to visit Dad next Saturday.</p>
        <p>13 October 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>It rained almost all day. So Angela got wet coming home from helping to run the lunch club. Meanwhile I investigated boot loaders and rEFInd in particular. Nevertheless, I did not manage to get it to perform as I want. I also worked on the hall walls, filling and sanding to try to make them smoother. Then I did as much preparation as I can to the wing of my model, prior to covering.</p>
        <p>14 October 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today I gave the hall ceiling another coat of white paint and added a little Basecoat over my filling and sanding of the walls. Just before dinner I went to B&amp;Q to get some more sample pots of paint and put a little of each on the wall.<br />
        Angela went to the village this morning, to a WI committee meeting this afternoon and to a church meeting this evening! Unfortunately, while she was at her WI meeting the hospital postponed her ear operation!<br />
        I also took the ailerons off the wings of my model and widened the hinge slots.</p>
        <p>15 October 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning we picked the cooking apples and then I went to B&amp;Q and bought some white emulsion for the hall walls. We did not like any of the sample pots! After lunch I painted gloss on the porch frame and door. I also bought two smoke detectors and fitted them.</p>
        <p>16 October 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day! We were quite early, but it seemed to take a long time and we had quite a late lunch. Afterward, Angela went to Bay's and I started painting the skirtings/door frames.</p>
        <p>17 October 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>An early start to spend the day at Hangleton Junior School. The day worked well.<br />
        In the evening we went to a 'quiz night' at the church. Our team of four came second (out of five) by one point! But the fish and chips were good.</p>
        <p>18 October 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After our walk to the newsagents, the rest of the day was spent gloss painting the door frames and skirting boards.</p>
        <p>19 October 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>This morning I finally finished painting the door frames and skirting boards. Now just the walls to paint.<br />
        After lunch we went to Dad's. Luckily (or unluckily, depending on how you look at it) it was dry enough to cut his grass.</p>
        <p>20 October 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>After doing the accounts and sending a couple of e-mail I started painting the walls of the hall. It took the rest of the day! Meanwhile, after lunch, Angela went to a WI meeting.</p>
        <p>21 October 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A less tiring day today. I put back the cupboard doors in the hall,screwed back the sockets/switches, re-fitted the light, filled the radiator, put back the shelf and hung the mirror and paintings. This afternoon we took Bay to the opticians in Steyning. We had our main meal at lunch-time, since I went to an IET talk at Falmer in the evening. Although it was advertised as being about lighting, it was more like the life story of the about 90 year old presenter. I also heard that Gary Williams has been moved to Singapore!</p>
        <p>22 October 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Following an early start, we took Dad's shopping list, along with that for Bay and us, and went to M&amp;S and Tesco. We were back at Dad's by 10:30! Then we were home by 11:45. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I checked in for our flights to Rotterdam tomorrow and took Bay her shopping. When I got there the plumber was replacing the ball valve in a tank in her loft. Then I started packing for our trip to Rotterdam. When Angela returned from table tennis we took Sam to the cattery.</p>
        <p>23 October 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>I had planned our journey to Rotterdam quite carefully. However, I had not allowed for the Jubilee line being suspended while we were on a train at Southwark station! We were given poor advice by a member of staff, to walk to the next station and continue with tube and DLR. However, we hailed a taxi and got to the gate as it was closing, having rushed through the airport carrying our coats and belts from security. The starting bus journey to Shoreham and the train to Victoria went well, but the tube journey was our downfall. On the plus side, we had views of the Shard, of the Tower of London, of Tower Bridge and the cable car across the Thames.<br />
        The journey from Rotterdam airport to the centre was easier and less hurried. We bought our OVChip cards and caught the bus. Inside the Central Station we met Krista and Rowan and then used the Metro and bus to get to Krimpen ann de Lek. Having left home at ten past nine in the morning, we were in their flat by five o'clock (Dutch time). A journey time of less than seven hours.</p>
        <p>24 October 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>We woke up as Paul closed the front door. Then, after a breakfast of porridge and toast, we went off to view a house with Krista and Rowan. We met Greet there also. The house was in the same village as the 'project' house, but was a relatively new house, with a wooden house on the front and a 'studio' apartment made out of a concrete silo! The inside of the main house was quite spectacular and there were many outbuildings, including a stable and a large workshop. Many of the buildings contained birds and other animals, and four horses were in the field.<br />
        Afterwards we drove past the 'project' house and then on to Greet and Wim's for coffee. Since it was raining and very misty we stayed there for lunch and afternoon tea before returning to Krista's flat.</p>
        <p>25 October 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A latish start this morning. In fact we only just got to the Waterbus jetty in time to catch the 11:30 boat. However, it took us to the centre of Rotterdam in 15 minutes. We then walked past some interesting building to the old ha our, where we had lunch. Then we walked around the old market and in the new market hall before walking down the main shopping street and then back to the Waterbus jetty. We stopped near the jetty for coffee before catching the Waterbus.<br />
        After dinner (we stopped at the local supermarket on the way back), Greet and Wim called with a selection of cream cakes to have with coffee.</p>
        <p>26 October 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>We had a relatively late start, in spite of the clocks going back. So after a late breakfast we walked down the Hooftstrase in Krimpen aan de Lek to the ferry that crosses the Lek to Kinderdijk. We stopped for a coffee before walking down the dijk and looking at the windmills. On our return, we had lunch at a restaurant before walking home.later in the afternoon Paul (with Krista and Rowen) drove us to the airport.<br />
        The flight was a little early leaving and we topped up our Oyster cards and caught the DLR and tube to Victoria station. We were early and so had 90 minutes to wait before our train left. It then seemed to do little more than 30 mph all the way to Shoreham. A taxi then got us home at eleven o'clock.</p>
        <p>27 October 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Sam Davis picked me up at 8 o'clock this morning and drove me to Brighton for the interviews for a 'head of insight'. Two of the six applicants had pulled out, so we were able to complete the interviews before lunch. Then we discussed the candidates and made a decision. The feedback from the presentations matched our views. After a while in the PAO, Sam brought me home. Then, heavy with cold, I slept in the chair for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
        <p>28 October 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today was a day spent trying to catch up. Angela did some washing and spent a lot of time in the garden. Meanwhile I looked my e-mail and downloaded the photos that I took over the weekend. The 'smart photo' option that I inadvertently used actually took five photos each time I pressed the shutter. So I had to go through them all and delete the unwanted ones. I then put some (most) of them into an album and loaded it on to the iPad. Then I installed an upgrade to OS X ('Yosemite), which took quite some time. I also checked my mbna card PIN and tested the time clocks, which now seem to work.<br />
        If anything, my cold seems worse today.</p>
        <p>29 October 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A day not doing very much except feeling sorry for myself! If anything, in spite of taking some Lemsip, my cold has been worse today. All I really achieved was to do last week's accounts.</p>
        <p>30 October 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Another day not doing very much&quot; having said that, we did start by doing the weekly shop for us, Dad and Bay. During the afternoon, while Angela took Bay's shopping to her, I practiced the piano using the metronome - very difficult. Then I added another chapter to the adventures of Sam cat. Most of the time was spent finding photos to use.</p>
        <p>31 October 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Angela has been out for most of the day. She went down to Steyning and then caught the bus to Worthing. Unfortunately, the last bus home did not turn up. So she had to get the bus to Shoreham and then wait for an hour for the bus to Steyning. So she did not get home until after 5:30. By this time I had called the bus company, but they were closed! And I was talking to the local police! Angela had tried to phone using her mobile, but she was pressing the wrong button!<br />
        Meanwhile, I had a quiet day. I tried playing the piano using the metronome again (and again found it very difficult), I had a practice on the flight simulator and I created the structure of a presentation on Technology in RC aircraft.</p>
