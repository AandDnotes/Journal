        <p>1 July 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A very bad night's sleep was followed by a 5 am rise. I was at the South of England Showground just after seven and so was one of the first to register and the second judge to arrive in the 'judges chamber'. The Big Bang South East event was very good and I got home at about 4:30 after stopping for some petrol.</p>
        <p>2 July 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Another early start, although not quite as early as yesterday. I went to Worthing College to help during their 'Gifted &amp; Talented' year 10 day. Students from three of the feeder schools were given a look at some STEM topics and spoke to six STEM Ambassadors about their jobs. When I got home I did a little more on the fitting of the wing on my model.</p>

        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again. So trips to Dad's and Auntie Bay's. We tested her microwave (broken) and so took her to Bunces in Steyning to get one she had seen. But they had just sold the only one they had and so needed to order one for her.<br />
        Afterwards I cut the grass at the front and rear.</p>
        <p>4 July 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>We spent the morning preparing for our visitors, who arrived at about one o'clock. After some PIMS in the garden we had lunch and, quite late, drove to Highdown gardens. We started by walking to the top of Highdown Hill and then walked around the garden. We then found our way to the coast road at Goring and had a cup of tea sat outside the Sea Lane cafe. Then home for an indoor pic nic.</p>
        <p>5 July 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A good day out to Standen House near East Grinsted.</p>
        <p>6 July 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A lazy morning having a late breakfast and then reading the paper. Dick and Kate left after lunch. We then washed up and walked down to Steyning to buy a paper. But they had sold out, so we walked across the river to Hyde Square. They had one, but the whole walk took well over an hour. We then spoke firstly to Paul and later to Victoria.</p>
        <p>7 July 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I finally got around to drilling and tapping the bolt holes for attaching the wing of my model to the fuselage. I clamped some scrap ply under the wing bolt mount so as to prevent the bottom layer breaking away as the drill bit came through. Angela needed to wait for someone to bring a cheque, so we did not go to Dad's until after lunch. After changing his bed and putting his washing on, I trimmed his box hedge. He again insisted that he had found his hedge trimmer hanging in the shed at the bottom of the garden. We looked again, but no sign of it! We told him that we were planning to visit Victoria in November and that he would need to go to Alan's. He was not very happy about that. We then went to Lyons Farm to go to a curtain shop. However, it had closed and so we went into B&amp;Q to see what they had in the way of roller blinds. They have one that should be ok, so I will go back on Wednesday. After dinner I did some research on flights to San Francisco, local transport and hotels.</p>
        <p>8 July 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The morning started with some work on my model. I cut the cockpit window to shape and taped it in place, shaping the structure to help it fit. I could then add trim to the wing. I also started preparing the tailplane for fitting on the saddle.<br />
        After lunch we sorted out an old savings account, adding money to our ISAs and putting the rest in my 1-2-3 account. We could do all that online.<br />
        We worked out a provisional schedule for our trip to California.<br />
        I also found a bulb that fitted the outside light fitting and cleared out the gutters. It had rained hard and the gutters overflowed.</p>
        <p>9 July 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning I glued the tailplane and the fin to my model. I also investigated flights and hotels so that after lunch we booked our flights to San Francisco. Then I went to the Dorothy Stringer school in Brighton to meet Andy Latham, the head of science, and to find out what they were trying to achieve at the two sessions next week. On the way home I bought a roller blind for the kitchen. I tried B&amp;Q in Shoreham, but they did not have one in the right size. So I had to travel to Lyons Farm.</p>
        <p>10 July 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day! At least we managed to get a coffee part way through. After a latish lunch Angela went to Bay's and I worked on my model. I made reasonable progress, fitting the rudder and the stringers along the back. I also examined the roller blind,the material of which is narrower than we expected. It is only as wide as the window opening, so would look odd if fitted on the outside of the window reveal. And it would not be possible to drill holes inside the reveal since the brackets need to be too close to the sides or top.</p>
        <p>11 July 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I started by fixing the fallen mirror back on the wardrobe door in huge front bedroom. It took quite a while to remove the old sticky pads. I then spent most of the rest of the day working on my model. You can't see much progress, since all the work is on fiddly bits of infill and shaped pieces.<br />
        After lunch we looked at several hotels in San Francisco and booked one for the first few days of our visit.</p>
        <p>12 July 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A busy, but enjoyable day. After our usual walk to the newsagents at Beeding, Robert and Heather visited for a couple of hours. The weather was such that we could sit in the garden to talk and drink coffee. After lunch we read some of the paper and I did a little to my model before we had an early dinner and then went to a Music Society concert. We took Bay and so walked to her house with the wheel chair and then pushed her to the Steyning Centre. We saw/heard Piano 4 Hands, who were very good, even though I dislike one piece they played (The Rite of Spring by Stravinsky). However, their two encore pieces saved the day.</p>
        <p>13 July 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A less eventful day. I went alone to the newsagents since we were up late and Angela did not have time before going to church. I then spent most of what remained of the morning working on my model, adding the undercarriage wire and the tail-wheel wire. This took longer than expected, since the main undercarriage wire was not bent to plan. After lunch I tried to take Angela's secateurs apart so as to sharpen them but I had to leave them soaking in WD40! So I investigated the trimmer and found that the fuel line exit bung had been distorted. Putting it in properly seems to have stopped the fuel leak. I also checked the spark plug and put a little more grease in the head- end gear.</p>
        <p>14 July 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today started with a visit to Dad to cut his grass and change his bed. Angela was helping at the lunch club. After lunch I sorted out travel insurance and booked Sam into the cattery. Then is strimmed under the front trees and the front flagstones and cleared the weeds from the gutters. During the evening, before talking with Paul, I modified my slide set for the careers talk on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>15 July 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning I took Dad to Worthing Hospital, firstly to the eye clinic and then to the maxilo-facial unit for check-ups. We were back at his house by about 11:00 and I was home just after twelve. Meanwhile, Angela took Sam to the vet for her jab. Apparently she was very good.<br />
        This afternoon I dismantled Angela's secateurs, cleaned and sharpened them. Then I removed the engine, mount and nose wheel from my plane and cut away the base sheeting behind the firewall. I decided that I could repair the firewall, rather than replace it, and made a ply brace that I will glue to the back of the firewall.</p>
        <p>16 July 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Quite a busy day. While Angela cooked things for her table tennis group lunch, I glued a strengthening piece to the firewall of my plane, hopefully straightening the firewall in the process. After a very early lunch I went off to the Dorothy Stringer school in Brighton for the first day of their STEM activities. That seemed to go well. I got home by four, we had an early dinner and then collected Bay and took her to Worthing to see the Mousetrap. It was very hot in the theatre and neither Bay nor Angela could hear what the actors were saying very well. Also, their was no programme, only a souvenir diamond jubilee brochure that cost eight pounds!</p>
        <p>17 July 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>On our way to Dad's today, to compile his shopping list, we called by the shoe shop in Findon, since they had a sale. Angela bought a pair of sandals, identical to the ones she was wearing!<br />
        We then did the shopping, starting with coffee in M&amp;S. So by the time that we had been back to Dad's to unpack his shopping and fill his pill box it was quite late before we got home for lunch. Angela then took Bay her shopping while I completed the repair of my plane. I just now need to apply the covering. I also started researching electric motors for my model.<br />
        We had a long chat with Victoria in the evening. She was upset that Austin does not want her to leave him at nursery.</p>
        <p>18 July 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Before an early lunch I covered the new piece of my plane with film. Then a trip to Dorothy Stringer High School in Brighton. I thought thAt I was going to be late when the A27 was jammed and lots of people were trying to go down the A23 into Brighton, but I got there in time. They had fewer, larger groups this time and so it was more difficult to do the exercise and they seemed more reluctant to speak. When I got home, about four, I did the accounts and started researching ESCs.</p>
        <p>19 July 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We got to the newsagents and back in time for the arrival of Paul, Krista and Rowan (and Connie). Later, Paul went off to collect Dad and I collected Bay (after await). We did not let Bay sit down, taking her straight into the dinging room. We all simply sat in the garden after lunch, since it was a hot, sunny day. I took them both home after tea and we watched a film.</p>
        <p>20 July 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Paul, Krista and Rowan joined us for our walk to the newsagent. We were heading for the park, but Rowan went to sleep in her buggy before we crossed the river. So we walked home and sat in the garden until lunch. They left after lunch and we had a breakfast-time chat with Victoria and Austin, who was more interested in playing with some coins and a cardboard box.</p>
        <p>21 July 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent at Dad's, changing his bed and doing his washing. Then I spent all afternoon putting up the blind in the kitchen while Angela went to her WI meeting. After dinner I spent a little time researching LiPo batteries.</p>
        <p>22 July 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela entertained Mel and Val, I re-installed the nose wheel and engine in my plane. I also continued. my research into electrical and R/C bits for my model. Bay phoned to say that her hand was hurting and so she could not drive to the surgery. So Angela took her. After that, we went to Lyons Farm to look at vacuum cleaners, since our old Dyson was getting hot and not picking up. We bought a small Samsung 'canister' cleaner rather than an upright.</p>
        <p>23 July 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went walking with her WI club while I sent photos of the kitchen to Tony the builder and continued researching equipment for my model. I also put the new vacuum cleaner together to check that it was all there and worked and activated my new credit card.<br />
        After lunch I walked to Beeding to get my hair cut and continued researching.</p>
        <p>24 July 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day. We were quite early and so got back in time for lunch as usual. I then spent most of the afternoon doing more research, including pricing, for the motor/RC components for my model. However, I am still uncertain about the size of the motor needed.</p>
        <p>25 July 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning I finally got to the flying site. I arrived at ten to ten and I was the only person there until 11:30! I did a number of reasonable landings (plus some bouncy touch-and-goes), in spite of the gusty wind. After lunch I cut the sides of a yew bush and did some more RC research. However I'm even more confused about motor and prop sizing. So I e-mailed Alan Murry for advice.</p>
        <p>26 July 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning seemed to be spent buying a newspaper. Actually we got up late, had a shower and then walked down to Steyning to buy a paper and a cake for Bay. So we then had to go round to her to deliver the cake. As it happened, she had expected visitors, but had got the wrong week! When we got home we then read the paper and I did the weekly accounts until we went out into the garden. I cut down some of the lilac and shredded it.</p>
        <p>27 July 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following our usual walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper I did some more RC motor/prop. We had intended to visit Dad after lunch, since Angela is going out tomorrow, to change his bed and cut his grass. However, he phoned just before lunch to say that he had locked himself out. When I got there I found that he had gone out through his conservatory, but then tried to get back in through the patio door, which was locked! Whilst there I changed his bed and decided that his grass did not need cutting. He had no washing, saying that he had done it as it was dirtied.<br />
        After a late lunch I did some more research, having had replies from Alan Murry and Paul Gladstone.</p>
        <p>28 July 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We had some heavy rain and thunder this morning. There was flooding in Worthing. Angela went to Petworth House to meet Carole and was a little concerned about flooding on route. So I had a nice quiet day, mainly refining my list of 'bits' for my model. I finally have a list, having decided to at least start with a motor and prop of the size recommended with the kit.</p>
        <p>29 July 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>I started the day by finding out what the delivery costs would be from HobbyKing. US (International warehouse) prices are lower than those from the UK warehouse! But the delivery, on goods to the value of &#163;120, were &#163;23. Also, if anything needs to be returned, it will be expensive. However, the UK warehouse does not stock all items. So I will need to buy things from different suppliers, all in the UK.<br />
        After lunch we took Bay into Worthing to buy a frame to help put on her compression stockings. We also went to M&amp;S and had a cup of tea in Waitrose. Tiring!</p>
        <p>30 July 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Angela not only went walking this morning, but also stayed out for lunch with her walking friends. Meanwhile I went up to the flying site. As usual at ten o'clock I was the only one there. Two others arrived just as I was finishing. I had problems towards the end with the engine. It became difficult to start and did not seem to have its usual power. I had to abort a takeoff. But then it flew ok. However, I opened the needle valve a little, so as to make the mixture richer, and the revs went up. Also, when I got home, I adjusted the servo so that the carburettor opens fully. After a latish lunch I spent more time looking at servos and battery charger suppliers. It seems that the one I have chosen has a lot of 'fake' versions on the market! I can't find a genuine version available in the UK. HK's European warehouse want &#163;8 delivery!</p>
        <p>31 July 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>The day started with a trip to Sompting and then on to Worthing hospital for Dad to have a biopsy taken from a lump behind one ear. Traffic problems along the coast road caused us to turn around and take the long route, but we arrived ten minutes early and Dad went straight into be seen. In fact we were out before the time of his appointment. So we were able to have an early lunch and get the weekly shop done in reasonable time.</p>
