        <p>1 December 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We decided last night that Victoria's cold was too heavy to attempt to go on the train to Sacramento. So we got up late and drove to Woodland for lunch. In so doing we drove past the Syngenta site. We also saw where they had lived before moving to Davis.<br />
        I booked a B&amp;B in Placerville for the next two nights, even though it is going to be very wet.</p>
        <p>2 December 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning, after Victoria had taken Austin to nursery school, she took us downtown to pick up our hire car. A red Ford Fiesta. We then set off along Interstate 80 towards Sacramento. Then on to US50 for a short while before turning off on to California 16 and joining 49, which would take us to Placeville. We stopped for a coffee at Plymouth before going on to Placeville, where we arrived at around one o'clock. The Sacramento valley is very flat, but the drive from Plymouth to Placeville was more interesting, since there were real hills and winding roads. We had lunch in Placeville and then walked the length of Main Street, in the rain! Out feet got quite wet. The B&amp;B seemed quite adamant that check in was not until four o'clock, so we sat in the car until then! After a glass of wine and a look at the menus of various restaurants, we walked across the footbridge to Main Street and went to a Mexican restaurant.</p>

        Wednesday</p>
        <p>We had a leisurely start, with breakfast at nine o'clock (the Shafsky version of eggs benedict - English muffin, scrambled egg, saut&#233;ed vegetables, sprinkle of chilli powder, two spears of asparagus, cherry tomatoes marinaded in lemon juice and olive oil). We then walked down to the town. We went into the hardware store; quite an amazing shop; and bought a small wooden rolling pin and a Christmas-tree decoration. We then went on to look around the small museum. After that, we returned to the B&amp;B and drove to an apple farm and to a winery. The first apple farm was very disappointing, being little more than a large shed with some apple-based products for sale. The second was a little better in that they had some picnic tables under cover. So we stopped for a coffee and a cake. We then went on to the Madrona winery, where we tasted several red and white wines and bought three bottles to take back to Victoria's. From there, we returned to Placerville and went up 49 to Coloma, where the Californian gold rush started. Quite a nice bendy road. But it started raining heavily when we got there, so we drove around a scenic route in the hills. Steph at the B&amp;B said we were 'brave' to drive that route. By the time that we got back to Coloma the rain had eased and so we stopped for a coffee before heading back to Placerville. Later, after a glass of wine, we walked down to the town for a meal (in the Buttercup Pantry where they served 'lighter', but uninspiring dishes.</p>
        <p>4 December 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We had an exciting day today. It started as planned. We had breakfast, packed and set off on back roads towards a place called Folsom (I forgot to take a photo on my phone, so couldn't upload any). Folsom has a huge reservoir and an old town. The journey took less time than we thought and so we were back in Davis for lunch, arriving back at Victoria's at about 2:30. We decided to take the hire car back and then pick up Austin. Then the fun started.<br />
        When we got to Downtown Davis, the police had closed it off! It seems that there was a demonstration taking place. So we could not get to the car hire place! We got a little lost on the University campus and then phoned the hire company. But their suggested route was also blocked off. Eventually we persuaded the police to let us into a garage forecourt and out the other side into the road we wanted. We then had to walk to the railway station (about 20 minutes) to meet Victoria (and Austin). The whole episode took about two hours.<br />
        However, we had a good meal when we got back and now Austin is in the bath.ï»¿</p>

        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning we drove into Davis and caught the Amtrack train into Sacramento. It only takes 15 minutes, but we went on the upper deck and Austin was really engrossed. We looked at Sacramento Old Town and the State Capitol building. We were back in Davis by four o'clock.</p>
        <p>6 December 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Victoria received an e-mail from Brandon (in Thailand) saying that Woodland were holding their 'Holiday Parade' today. So after breakfast we drove to Woodland and spent two and a half hours watching the parade. Entertaining, but a little long. We went home for a late lunch and then went to Trader Joe's to buy some food and a cool bag.<br />
        In the evening I was able to watch the two episodes of Shield that I will miss due to being away.</p>
        <p>7 December 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A quieter day today. We got up late and spoke with Paul et al while Victoria cooked pancakes for breakfast. Paul has agreed to buy the 'project house'. We played with Austin and went for a walk during the morning and then swept up leaves after lunch, including removing some leaves from the front gutters.<br />
        We also checked-in to our flights for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>8 December 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We said goodbye to Austin this morning as he went off to nursery school. Then Victoria took us to the station. We caught the 10:25 Capital Corridor train to Richmond, where we changed to the BART. We changed trains at Powell so as to go SFO. We had some confusion over the terminal, but we had plenty of time and then found that the flight was delayed by an hour! The rest of the (short) day was spent on the plane.</p>
        <p>9 December 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning we landed at about 10:30. However, the plane was parked some way from the terminal and it took a while to be bussed to it. Eventually we met our taxi driver and arrived home just after one o'clock. Just after four we collected Sam from the cattery.</p>
        <p>10 December 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>After quite a reasonable night's sleep I went off this morning to the Cobham services on the M25 to meet Alan and collect Dad. They t held up in a traffic jam and so it was two o'clock before I got home. After a late lunch I checked the P.O. card and did the accounts, both weekly and monthly.</p>
        <p>11 December 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>On our way to the supermarket we went to the PO office in Small Dole to collect a package for Krista. In spite of a relatively early start, we were still quite late finishing. After lunch, Angela took Bay's shopping to her. Meanwhile I downloaded our holiday photos.</p>
        <p>12 December 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning we went into Worthing to do some Christmas shopping. We had lunch at Roger's Farm garden centre. While Angela went for a dental check-up, I had a call from Bay to say that she had an appointment at the doctors. So I took her. Later I went back into Worthing, to Maplins, to get some remote control electric plugs for Bay's Christmas present.</p>
        <p>13 December 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A walk to the paper shop. Reading the paper. Writing some of my Christmas cards.</p>
        <p>14 December 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>While Angela was at church, I sorted our California photos into albums and loaded them to the iPad so that we can show them to Bay and Dad. Later we spoke with Victoria and Paul. I also ordered a 'compatible' Arduino Uno R3 and a table stylus from GearBest.</p>
        <p>15 December 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We had a relatively early start this morning. Firstly we went to Worthing hospital so that Angela could give a swab for testing for MRSA. This only took a few minutes. We then went on to Sainsbury's to get some ingredients for another Christmas cake and some other items for Christmas. Then we enter on to Dad's. Angela changed his bed while I got his Christmas decorations down from his loft and fitted the new letterbox draught excluder. We also put his washing on and showed him our California photos.<br />
        After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I got our Christmas decorations from the loft. I also did the weekly accounts for last week. Later I experimented with the latest version of iMovie.</p>
        <p>16 December 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning we drove to Littlehampton, to the Kent Reliance building society branch to open two regular savings accounts. We stopped off at Roundstone garden centre and then at Roger's Farm garden centre for lunch. When we got home we took the high-chair back to Val and John. In the evening I went to the IET talk at Falmer.</p>
        <p>17 December 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to Bay's to show her our holiday photos and get her shopping list. As usual, this made us quite late for dinner.</p>
        <p>18 December 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We started our weekly shopping trip early, going from Dad's to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm. I set up the standing orders to pay money into our KRBS regular savings accounts while Angela took Bay's shopping to her. However, Angela came back for me so that we could remove the mattress from Bay's bed and collect details of a plant order. We ordered the bowls of hyacinths, putting in the delivery address for each, only to find that the order included that same address (Bay's) for all of them! We phoned, but we're told that we needed to phone again in the morning.</p>
        <p>19 December 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Bay's back was still hurting this morning, so she phoned us. Then Dad phoned to say that his heating had stopped working! So after lunch Angela went to Bay's and I went to Dad's. I not needed to reset his boiler. Also, Angela started putting up the Christmas decorations and I started wrapping presents. I spray-pained the cowl of my model. Unfortunately, the Cub Yellow of the paint is different to the Cub Yellow of the Solartex! I also glued the top and bottom edges of the windshield, taping it in place.</p>
        <p>20 December 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>It was bright, but breezy for our walk to the newsagents in Beeding this morning. That was followed by reading the paper and then bringing the Christmas tree into the sitting room. After lunch I put the lights on it, plus some lengths of tinsel and left the rest for Angela. While Angela went to Bay's, I wrapped the remaining presents and put up the other battery lights. I also did the second stage of gluing the canopy on my model.</p>
        <p>21 December 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to church, I went over to Dad's. After lunch we tidied the decorations in the dining room and while Angela went to a carol concert I worked on my model. I glued the side windows and made the wing strut fastening straps. When Angela got home we spoke to Paul and, a little later, to Victoria.</p>
        <p>22 December 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>I took Angela to Worthing hospital for midday so that she could spend the afternoon having permanent grommets fitted in her ear drums. It was six o'clock before she called to say that she was ready to come home. So it was seven o'clock before we were home. Paul et al arrived just before she called. They had managed to catch the earlier ferry.<br />
        Earlier I did a little on my model, while Angela did some cooking.</p>
        <p>23 December 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning, Paul et al left for Twickenham to meet up with friends and stay with Martin over night.<br />
        This afternoon we took Dad to Worthing hospital to get the results of the biopsies he had taken some time ago. He needs more surgery, at St Richards in Chichester!<br />
        I registered on the PlotBrowser site with the password David@PlotB.</p>
        <p>24 December 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Angela wasn't feeling too well this morning, so I went down to Steyning to collect the turkey and do the final bits of shopping. We had borrowed Bay's shopping bag on wheels. Before I went, Bay phoned to say that her back pain was back and so she had called the doctor. After lunch I took Angela to the pharmacy to pick up Bay's prescription and then dropped her at Bay's. I went home to wait for Paul et al, who arrived at about three o'clock. We then made paper chains and blew up balloons before getting dinner.</p>
        <p>25 December 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Christmas Day. The turkey went into the oven at 9:15 and Paul collected both Dad and Bay before lunch. It was three o'clock before we finished, just in time for the Queen's Christmas broadcast, even though Bay missed it! Rowan did a good job of handing out the presents from under the tree. I took Dad and Bay home, just in time to get home to watch Downton Abbey.</p>
        <p>26 December 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Boxing Day. Up late, collected Dad and Bay, Rowan was sick on the hall carpet and over Krista.</p>
        <p>27 December 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Paul and Krista took their car off this morning to have it cleaned. They had hoped to go on their own, but Rowan was getting upset at anything and everything, so they took her with them. They were back for a a late lunch, but Rowan was only interested in sleep. Even later, after a long sleep, she had little interest in food, unless it was chocolate! However, she perked up while having a bath, but she didn't want to get out. During the afternoon I took photos of Paul's car and we found a cottage in Cornwall and booked it for the week prior to the wedding to which they have been invited on July 4th.</p>
        <p>28 December 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went to church, Paul et al went to see Glenn and I did the accounts and cooked lunch! After lunch I drove them to Gatwick. It seems that their flight was delayed by about an hour. We then started the jigsaw that V&amp;B gave us.</p>
        <p>29 December 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>I started by creating a photo album for a selection of Christmas snaps. I also created a short movie from the one clip of Rowan handing out presents. After lunch we went over to Dad's to do his washing and get his shopping list. We then went to the bed shop and to Curries at Lyons Farm to look at beds for Bay and at freezers. Just as we finished dinner we spoke with Victoria.</p>
        <p>30 December 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Quite an eventful day. We started fairly early by going shopping for us, Dad and Bay. Then I sold Paul's car. Someone called this morning, having put an ad in Friday-ad yesterday, and I arranged for him to call at lunchtime. He came with his father (who new quite a bit about cars) and we eventually settled on &#163;650. Then we took Bay into Worthing to buy a new bed. It took considerably less time than we thought it would. So we then had a cup of tea and some cake before coming home.</p>
        <p>31 December 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A quieter day today. Angela walked to Steyning a couple of times and I updated the accounts. We also paid Rowan's Christmas cash into her account and paid Paul's car cash into his account.</p>
