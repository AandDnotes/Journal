        <p>1 May 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Ten months of retirement already!<br />
        To Dad's (to make out his shopping list) and then to Sainsbury's at Hove, followed by M&amp;S at Holmbush. We then decided to take Dad out for lunch and to look for a new pair of shoes. So we took him to the other Sainsbury's (at Lyons Farm) and then to the shoe warehouse, where he found a suitable pair of shoes. We got home at about three and Angela then took Bay's shopping to her while I played with the central heating. By closing the valves on the other radiators, I managed to get some hot water to flow through the bathroom radiator. We will have to see if it continues to work! I also managed to finish filing the contents of my in-tray. Now just the lower tray to tackle!<br />
        After tea we booked tickets for the Mousetrap in Worthing in July.</p>
        <p>2 May 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A good part of the day was spent sorting and filing the contents of the lower tray on my desk. This is mainly receipts, manuals, and maps. I then added a little more to my RC blog, uploading a photo of my DIY antennae. My Santander 1-2-3 account debit card also arrived.<br />
        I had another try to get the bathroom radiator working. I again closed off all the other radiators (apart from the hall rad, which I only partially closed) and left the pump running for a while. The bathroom radiator got hot, but cooled down when I opened the other rads.</p>
        <p>3 May 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Following a walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper, and being the first Saturday of the month, it was time to do the monthly accounts. After that, I took the wheelchair around to Bay's and wheeled her down to the Methodist church for a ploughman's lunch and to view the flower festival. Meanwhile, Angela had spent most of the morning there, helping to prepare the lunches. I then wheeled her home, replaced a bulb and looked at some letters re finance.for her. It was 4:30 by the time that I left! Angela was home by 5:30.</p>
        <p>4 May 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The morning started like most Sundays, with a walk to the newsagents in Beeding. Angela then walked on to the church and I walked home to wait for Paul et al. Whilst waiting I modified the underside of the ribs on the wing that I am building. It is now ready to glue the main ribs, leading and trailing edge and the bottom spar.<br />
        Paul arrived at about 12 o'clock and Angela was back by 12:30. We had lunch before Angela left for the flower festival. We then spent some time in the garden before having a cup of tea and them leaving for home; with the cat! Angela was home by 5:30, shortly after which we spoke to Victoria and Austin.</p>
        <p>5 May 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Another day helping at the flower festival. I took Angela down at about ten and then I went down at 10:30 to sell lunch tickets. I left a little after two, walked home, changed and went to Dad's to cut his grass.<br />
        Before I went down to the church I moved the kitchen table into the dining room, along with the microwave and toaster. On my return from Dad's I removed everything that was fixed to the walls.</p>
        <p>6 May 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>We spent most of the day moving the contents of the kitchen cupboards and the items on the work tops into the dining room and the spare bedroom. We also moved out the dishwasher and the washing machine (after Angela had done a final wash).<br />
        I also did some work on my model. I trimmed the bottom of the wing ribs and made them ready for gluing.</p>
        <p>7 May 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A busy day. Tony Kennard arrived before nine to start the kitchen. While he was taking out the old units and knocking tiles off the walls, I worked on the left wing of my plane.<br />
        After an early lunch I took Dad to his appointment at the eye clinic at Worthing hospital. He has dry macular degeneration in his right eye and bad cataracts in both. So he now awaits an appointment to have the cataracts removed from his right eye. We arrived at the hospital at 13:40 and left at 16:30. I got home just before six! But I did fill Dad's pill box and made out his shopping list. So I don't need to go over in huge morning.<br />
        Meanwhile, Angela pushed Bay down to the surgery for her nose to be checked, and then pushed her home! By the time that she got home, Tony had left. We now have a garage full of old kitchen, although Tony seems to have taken the cooker.</p>
        <p>8 May 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>The electrician arrived before 8am this morning! But we were just about ready. So I went through the requirements with him and then let him get on. By 4:30 he had installed all the new cable, including the lights, and will be back in the morning to finish off.<br />
        Angela went off to do the weekly shop, dropping stuff off at Dad's before getting home at 12:30. Meanwhile I completed the left wing of my model. After lunch I made a start on the right wing while Angela took Bay's shopping to her and then took her to the garden centre.<br />
        After dinner I experimented with laying out the ground station components on a stripboard in Fritzing.</p>
        <p>9 May 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>The electrician was back before eight! But the plasterers did not arrive until nine. The wiring was finished by about eleven and the plasterer finished by about five. The plasterer did not have anything to fill the holes in the ceiling and said there was more to do than he thought. Anyway, they went off to get some plasterboard and he finished an hour earlier than he thought. So he only charged &#163;25 more than his quote!<br />
        While all this was going on, Angela went to Worthing on the bus to pick up an umbrella that we had ordered from Mothercare for Rowan. When she got home I wrapped the umbrella, Austin's Lego and two books. While Angela was out I cut the back grass and built the right wing of my model. I just need to trim parts and sand it. Then I can try joining the two halves.</p>
        <p>10 May 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A long, tiring day, but a good one. We set of at nine o'clock to go to the stationers in Steyning to buy two helium filled balloons. We then went on to Paul's, arriving before Victoria et al, for Rowan and Austin's second birthday party. Well, we had some sandwiches and a cake with two candles. Then we went to the playground across the road before coming back for a cup of tea, managing to dodge the showers. Both children had a short nap (somewhat reluctantly), before Paul and Brandon went out to get a Chinese take-away and the children made quite a mess on the sitting room floor.<br />
        In spite of a crowded Twickenham, we were home by 9:30.</p>
        <p>11 May 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to the newsagents in Beeding, I spent most of the morning checking the bank statement and writing e-mail. But I should have been emptying the car of the things that we took off Victoria yesterday when we met at Paul's.<br />
        After a slightly late lunch we went over to Dad's with a basket of washing! We used his machine, changed his bed and did his washing. Angela also vacuumed around and I topped up his pill box.<br />
        When we got home I cleaned the kitchen floor of plaster spots. It took almost S long to empty the garage vacuum cleaner. Then we cooked sweet and sour chicken in the microwave.</p>
        <p>12 May 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>The flooring man arrived at eight o'clock and spent until 2:45 laying plywood and covering it with a fine screed. Meanwhile, Angela spent most of the day helping at the lunch club and I worked (slowly) on my model. I trimmed the right wing and then spent quite some time making the two wing halves fit together properly. Initially, the joining piece fitted snugly, but the wings did not line up. However, I managed to glue the two halves together and make and fit one wing tip.<br />
        I worked slowly since I seem to have picked up a sore throat and cold from the grandchildren!</p>
        <p>13 May 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today we got a fake wood floor in the kitchen. The floored arrived at eight o'clock and left at four. Angela went to her WI committee meeting this afternoon, while I worked on my model. Since I have a heavy cold and did not sleep very much last night, my progress was slow. However, I shaped the wing tip that I fitted yesterday, fitted the tip to the other wing and shaped that. Tomorrow the kitchen fitter should come back and I can work on the ailerons.</p>
        <p>14 May 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning I paid for the kitchen units and they were delivered (although I didn't see them arrive). Tony laid protector sheets over the floor and started fitting the carcasses while Angela went walking and I worked (slowly) on my model. I fitted the centre section with the aileron levers and fitted the aileron on one side. My cold is really quite heavy.</p>
        <p>15 May 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Angela did the weekly shop on her own today, with visits to both Dad and Bay. My cold is still heavy and Tony, the kitchen fitter was here. He installed the wall cupboard carcasses and the work tops, including the sink.<br />
        I installed the second aileron and started the final parts of the wing build. So I should complete the wings tomorrow.</p>
        <p>16 May 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Definitely signs of my cold improving toady, although it might just be moving to the chronic phase.<br />
        It was a very fine day, probably the warmest this year. This morning I completed the wing of my model and this afternoon I cut the front grass, trimmed the growth under the trees at the front and started trimming the laurel bush in hype back garden. The final part of the wing was to install the servo tray, which meant cutting out the lower sheeting and removing the servo space section of the centre ribs. Unfortunately, the ribs had been glued with epoxy and the die-cut part could not be pressed out. I took photos of the wing, made a sketch of the die-cut rib and updated my build blog.<br />
        Tony installed the rest of the carcasses, along with the oven, fridge, hob and extractor. He also seems to have installed some of the cupboard fittings and claims that he is on schedule. Gas will be connected to the hob on Monday, the appliances will be connected to the power and the electrical second fix on Tuesday, and it should all be finished on Wednesday!<br />
        We transferred &#163;1,000 from Angela's 1-2-3 account into our current account so that we have enough in there to pay the electrician and Tony next week.</p>
        <p>17 May 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Saturday started as usual with a walk to buy a newspaper. However, today we needed to get some bread for lunch and so we walked to Steyning. After coffee and a read of the paper, Angela went in the garden while I did the accounts and started collecting material that I could use for a short careers talk. I had previously volunteered, as a STEM Ambassador, to help Worthing College and a school in Brighton.<br />
        We had an early lunch, since Angela wanted to go to the wedding of a friend's daughter. Then I did a little more material collecting, mainly images associated with industrial processes, measurements and control systems, and then went into the garden with the hedge trimmer and started cutting the bushes at the bottom of the garden. Unfortunately I caught the rim of the incinerator basket and bent part of the hedge cutter blade. So I spent an hour taking it apart and straightening the blade, before finishing the trimming.<br />
        Since it was such a fine evening we decided to walk down to Steyning for a fish supper. We went into the relatively new fish and chip shop, come restaurant. A group in there left shortly after we arrived and then we had the place to ourselves, although there seemed to be a steady stream of take-away orders. We had our cod char-grilled rather than fried in batter. It was good, but then we had to walk home!</p>
        <p>18 May 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Sunday, so a walk to Beeding, followed by coffee and reading yesterday's paper! Then I completed trimming the Laura's bush (at least the sides).<br />
        This afternoon we went to Dad's via B&amp;Q to get some bags of compost. Whilst there we did one load of our washing and put on a small load of his. I also cut his grass while Angela trimmed some edges.<br />
        When we got home we talked to Austin and to Rowan and I straightened the main wheel legs on my plane.</p>
        <p>19 May 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today I spent a long time trying to get Dad's electricity meter readings registered with Scottish Power. Their web site just said there was something wrong; their automated telephone line said that a reading was not needed! Using their free-phone number resulted in a 35 minute wait (listening to music) before being able to talk to someone, who then transferred me to someone else, cutting me off! I gave up on my second attempt after waiting for 45 minutes! Luckily, during the afternoon, I only had a five minute wait and found someone who dealt with it straight away.<br />
        While this was going on I laid out the ground station of my RC design on strip board in Fritzing. I added the other sticks and a buzzer output to the breadboard design.<br />
        During the afternoon I also cut the rear grass.</p>
        <p>20 May 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Updated RC blog to include layout of strip board and start of RF module page.<br />
        Built both sides of fuselage.<br />
        Electrician completed work in kitchen.<br />
        Went to IET lecture at Falmer, going to pub afterwards with Dick Morris, Roger and Paul.</p>
        <p>21 May 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Quite a momentous day - the kitchen was finished. Tony the installer went home at 2:30, leaving us to think about making it usable. In practice we had lunch (late, because, when Angela got home from the weekly shop, Tony was putting back the washing machine and dishwasher) and then took Bay her shopping (and compost).<br />
        While Angela was shopping I worked on my model, finishing the fuselage sides and constructed the joining formers. The next step is to actually join the two sides. I also painted black tips on the hands of the kitchen clock, in the hope that we will be able to see them. When we got back from Bay's, after five, I cleaned the garage while Angela started cleaning the kitchen.. We then cooked dinner on the hob. We put the dishwasher on to rinse, but there seems to be a slight leak on the inlet pipe.</p>
        <p>22 May 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>A momentous day was followed by a tiring day. After a walk to Bramber to vote in the European elections and on to Steyning to buy a door stop, we spent the rest of the day putting the kitchen contents back. In spite of there seeming to be far more in the way of cupboard space, we had a bit of a job finding a place for everything. But we got everything back in time to cook a late dinner.</p>
        <p>23 May 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>By the time that we set off for Binfield it was five minutes to nine! Things were going well until we were coming out of Bisley where we met a long queue due to some traffic lights being repaired. We spent half an hour in the queue and so did not arrive until after eleven. We helped sort out the rubbish and took it to the tip. Then we loaded up the two cars, but could not get everything in. So a return visit is planned. V&amp;B will go back tomorrow, while I take Dad to his hospital appointment and Angela looks after Austin. They have arranged for the buyers to call so as to check that everything has been left as expected.<br />
        We set off first and stopped (for a little too long) at Sainsbury's in Woking for some lunch. When we got home, at about 3:35, V&amp;B had already arrived and unpacked!</p>
        <p>24 May 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>V&amp;B decided to return to their house this morning so as to finish cleaning, bring back the remaining items and let their buyer have a final look. They set off at about 8:30am and left Austin with us. Angela took him down to Steyning while I took Dad to his dermatology appointment at Worthing hospital. He has to return in October.<br />
        After lunch we struggled to get Austin's car seat fitted, but we finally took him to Saisbury's to do some food shopping. It seems that V&amp;B arrived back before us, but went down to Steyning for a cup of tea. The garage is now full of 'things'!</p>
        <p>25 May 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A quite morning as V&amp;B took Austin into Worthing to get some new shoes and Angela went to church.. However, after walking to Beeding to buy a newspaper, hanging out the washing and doing the accounts, I ran out of time.<br />
        After lunch Angela and I took Austin to the playground in Beeding. We were out longer than we had planned, but then cooked a roast dinner in the new cooker.</p>
        <p>26 May 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A day spent entertaining people, namely Dad and Bay. So lunch for 6+1, then tea for the same.</p>
        <p>27 May 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A day catching up on things. This morning I took rubbish to the tip in Shoreham. We can now get the car in the garage!<br />
        After lunch Angela and I took Austin down to Steyning to buy some salad stuff. He was asleep before we got there, so we walked on to the barbers in Beeding. I went in while Angela took Austin on to the playground.<br />
        I did find some time to glue together the two sides of the fuselage of my plane.</p>
        <p>28 May 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning we took Austin down to Steyning to buy some meat and then on to the 'Messy Morning' session at the Methodist church hall. He didn't like getting messy, so just played with cars! He went sleep on the way home, so we got lunch in peace and I managed to glue the tail posts of the two sides of the fuselage of my model together, hopefully all square. After his lunch we played cars and read books, since it started to drizzle.<br />
        I also had correspondence with Gary about his talk in November.</p>
        <p>29 May 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Another day where we didn't actually get anything done. We spent the morning printing V&amp;B's apartment tenancy agreement, so that they could sign/initial most of the pages, scan it in and send it back and then went off to do the weekly shop. Since we were a little late starting, we had lunch in M&amp;S. Afterwards we took Austin around to Bay's, to take her to the chiropodist and then on to the garden centre. We had tea and cake outside and Austin had a little play in the sand pit. It was quite late by the time that we had dropped off Bay and got home. Luckily, V&amp;B had started preparing dinner. After dinner we 'pushed along' Austin (and Victoria) so as to get him in bed at a more reasonable time, in spite of his complaints.</p>
        <p>30 May 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>We took Austin to Steyning to do some shopping and then on to the playground in Fletchers Croft. Austin saw the old red tractor in the greengrocer's and then noticed that one of the climbing frames in the park was also in the shape of a tractor. In the afternoon we simply entertained Austin. Paul and Krista arrived at about 9:30, after V&amp;B had gone to bed!</p>
        <p>31 May 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We had a pretty good day. We set off for Drusillas at ten to ten and arrived at about half past. It was already busy, but got much busier as the day went on. The children liked the animals. We had our pick nick and then let them play on the slides etc. before letting them ride on the Thomas train. But two o'clock they were getting very tired. We had an ice cream, which was quite fraught, and then set off for home. We had an early dinner of fish and chips.</p>
