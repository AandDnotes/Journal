        Saturday</p>
        <p>This morning I walked down to the Steyning Centre to the Neighbourhood Plan meeting and Angela went to the Christmas card sale. The meeting was quite interesting. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I started populating my RC technology slides. We failed to get the mower to start!</p>
        <p>2 November 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to the Beeding newsagents, I again practiced the piano using the metronome (still bad) and continued to populate slides on my RC technology presentation. After lunch we went to Dad's to turn around his bed clothes and show him the photos of Rotterdam. When got home we spoke to Victoria and then to Paul.</p>
        <p>3 November 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Another day spent mainly trying to populate slides for a talk on RC technology. Although more time was spent reading about the technology and finding suitable pictures.</p>
        <p>4 November 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A much more productive day, even though my cold seems no better. This morning I started covering the wings of my model. I put fillets into the corners and covered the underside of one wing. We then had an early lunch (having our main meal) before taking Dad to Worthing hospital to the Maxillo Facial unit. There he had a scarred area on the back of his ear removed and biopsies taken from his head behind his ear and from the side of his nose. The anaesthetic injections looked very painful. When we took him home, I eased the mortise lock on his front door.<br />
        When we got home I left almost immediately to go to Falmer to an IET lecture. Brighton were playing at home and so queues were expected. I arrived early! But it was a good talk on the Brighton Atlantic Project.</p>
        <p>5 November 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning I spoke to Gary Williams! Luckily he is still able to do the talk on the 18th. So I e-mailed questions to check that other things are in place. Then I booked a taxi to take us to Heathrow later this month and collect us on our return.<br />
        After lunch I walked to Beeding and had a haircut. Then I covered the other underside of the wing of my model</p>
        <p>6 November 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Before heading for the supermarket, I went with Dad to see the nurse for his annual check-up. His blood pressure is very good, his cholesterol levels are excellent and his weight is the same as it was in 2000! He also had his flu jab. We then went off to M&amp;S and Tesco. After lunch we took Bay's shopping to her while Angela went to the optician.<br />
        I had more correspondence with Hamish about the Adur &amp; Worthing Big Bang and with Gary about his talk to the IET later this month I also registered with the Barefoot Computing Project.. </p>
        <p>7 November 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning I covered the top of one wing of my model. Then we drove to Shoreham, parked the car and caught the bus into Worthing. We had lunch in M&amp;S, I bought some trousers in Debenhams and then we went to the Connought to see 'What we did on our holidays'. It was quite entertaining.<br />
        This evening I spoke with Alan about meeting to 'hand over' Dad.</p>
        <p>8 November 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Our walk to Beeding newsagents ended up lasting all morning. We walked on to Steyning to buy two prints of Church Street. The people in St Banabus couldn't find them, so we went to the craft fair and art exhibition at the Steyning Centre. We bought a robin nest box and some cards, before going back to buy the prints.<br />
        After lunch I covered the remaining quarter of the wing on my model. I n ow need to drink the covering and build in a warp!</p>
        <p>9 November 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>We started with a walk to Beeding to buy a paper. Then Angela went on to church and I cam home. After a shower I adjusted the garage door and then drained the petrol tank on the mower. Some fresh petrol from the Beeding garage worked and so I cut the front grass. It was really much too wet, so I just tried to clean the mower and put it away.</p>
        <p>10 November 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I went over to Dad's to help him change his bed and put on his washing. I got home after Angela had left to help with the lunch club. After lunch I shrank the covering on the wings of my model, building in the 'washout'. I also covered one of the ailerons.</p>
        <p>11 November 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A busy day. It started with Angela taking me to Shoreham Airport for the Worthing and Adur Big Bang event. Hamish, George and I spent the day helping school and college children make LED 'torches'. I got home at 3:15 and did a little on my RC presentation. Then I went to an IET committee meeting in Crawley.</p>
        <p>12 November 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A quieter day today. I spent the morning catching up on e-mail and the reading associated with them. This included rating the short-list for the UoB graduate of the year award. After lunch I covered the remaining aileron, glueing their hinges to the wing later in the evening. I also fitted the servo, but have yet to connect it to the ailerons.<br />
        I e-mailed Jane at L3-Link and also heard from the Barefoot Computing Project, but the next training is while we are away.</p>
        <p>13 November 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again. We started fairly early, arriving at Dad's as he was walking down to the corner shop. However, we went into Next to buy some slippers for Austin and so we were quite late back to Dad's and it was two o'clock before we had our lunch.<br />
        While Angela took Bay's shopping to her, I had a piano practice, using the accompaniments that cam with the book, and then fitted connecting rods from the servo to the ailerons. The CA on the hinges had made them set solid, which I don't remember happening on the elevator and rudder. However, once freed, the servo seemed to move the ailerons quite well. I just need to buy a servo lead extension.<br />
        I also watched the inaugural lecture from William Web, the new president of the IET. His 'theme' is Influence, Inform, Inspire. He made a good point about needing to inform parents about engineering.</p>
        <p>14 November 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>After a long gap I did a little update to my model building blog. Then I covered the wing struts. That was quite a fiddly job. After dinner it was the flying club's AGM at Lancing Leisure Centre.</p>
        <p>15 November 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After walking to the newsagents I drove Angela to the church with her food processor and cakes for the Christmas Bazaar. Then I walked back down to man the food ticket stand. After a late lunch I walked home while Angela finished helping to clear up. Then I did the weekly accounts before we had tea.</p>
        <p>16 November 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following our usual walk to Beeding newsagents, I read part of yesterday's paper, had a piano practice and covered the landing gear fairings on my model. Then cleared the back gutters of leaves before doing some more on my back-up presentation. I also e-mailed Derek Wright to check that all is well for Tuesday's IET meeting. We have 29 people registered. We later spoke with Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>17 November 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I went over to Dad's to help change his bed (at least turn things around). During the afternoon,, while Angela was at her WI meeting, I backed up photographs. Now I can delete photos from the camera prior to our trip.i also completed my 'technology in RC' presentation.<br />
        Paul sent a message to say that they had bought the 'project' house!</p>
        <p>18 November 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The day started by printing off maps and timetables for our trip to California. We need to get from the airport to the hotel on Sunday and then from the hotel to Davis on Wednesday. This involves both the BART and an Amtrak train. Then I ordered some dollars in the Sainsbury's 'sale' to collect on Wednesday. After that, I cut away some of the ivy on the wall by our bedroom side window and fitted the robin nest box to the wall.<br />
        After lunch, while Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and to a garden centre, I cut the wire landing gear to size on my model, in preparation for fitting the fairings. When Angela returned, with about ten minutes to spare, I drove to Crawley to pick up Gary Williams and Victor Gough and take them to the Hawth, where Gary was to give a talk to the IET. It went very well and I joined them for a meal at their hotel afterwards, getting home at 11:15.</p>
        <p>19 November 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Today was Dad's birthday. So we went over there this morning for coffee and then went to collect our dollars from Sainsbury's. Angela bought some ingredients for the Christmas cake. We then bought a digital picture frame for Dad from Argos and a potted Christmas tree from B&amp;Q. I then seemed to spend the whole afternoon dealing with e-mail. Before we went out, I sent the attendance sheets for the talk the previous evening to the IET. Then later I sent copies of the presentations to our communications man. Finally, I fitted the landing gear fairings to my model.</p>
        <p>20 November 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We were able to go straight off shopping, having collected Dad's list yesterday. We then were able to spend time with Dad to help him liable his Christmas presents and put out his things to pack. After a late lunch we took Bay's shopping to her and took her to her Doctor's appointment. By the time we got home there was little time for anything other than to cook dinner.</p>
        <p>21 November 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>We were late up this morning after the exertions of yesterday. I spent a lot of time getting photos on my little pink memory stick for Dad's digital photo frame. Having deleted the existing files and loaded on the ones for the display, the frame started displaying photos that were not even in the deleted set! So I tried reformatting the stick, only to find that it would not then mount on the Mac or on Mint. It took some time to sort it out. However, the frame now works well.<br />
        We also sorted through a batch of re-directed mail for Paul and Krista. I had to scan some documents and mail them to Paul.<br />
        I also cut out the side windows for my model, but have not worked out what to use to glue them in place.</p>
        <p>22 November 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A busy day prior to going on holiday. I was over at Dad's by nine o'clock to help him pack his case and we were on our way by 09:40. We arrived at the Cobham services at ten to eleven. By the time that we had bought a coffee, we only had five minutes to wait for Alan. I was then home just before one.<br />
        Before lunch I put out things to pack. Angela had gone to a Neighbourhood Watch meeting and so we had a late lunch. We then packed and called firstly Paul and then Victoria. We had a short chat with each before taking Sam to the cattery.<br />
        Also registered bicycles, computers, TV and camera with the National Property Register.</p>
        <p>23 November 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>What a long day! We got up at six and was picked up by taxi at 7:30 to take us to Heathrow. The flight to San Francisco was long, with a very turbulent patch. I thought that I would need to use the paper bag! At SFO we bought our 'green' BART tickets and caught the train into SF. Then a short walk to the hotel, the Kensington Park, the lower floors of which are covered in scaffolding. The lobby and exterior is of a Spanish style and our room has a large, Spanish-style ceiling fan, which helps to keep it cool. We went to bed at 7:30, but that was like 3:30 in the morning.</p>
        <p>24 November 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today was all about exploring SF. We started with breakfast in a small cafe a few doors from the hotel and then walked down to the start of the cable car route at the bottom of Powell Street. We took that all the way to the end, near Fisherman's Warf, and walked back, up the hill, to Lombard Street. We then walked down the crookedest road. We returned to the bay, walking firstly around past the maritime museum and then back past the piers. It is like Blacpool, but without the tower and the pleasure park! We walked back to a small bakery we had passed and had a good (small) lunch.<br />
        We then walked to Telegraph Hill and went up the Coit Tower. Splendid views all around. Finally we walked through China Town, back to the hotel, exhausted and wondering what to do tomorrow!</p>
        <p>25 November 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>After breakfast we set off along Market Street until we came to Haight Street. Parts of Market Street are run down and were quite scary. We then walked up Seiner until we came to Alamo Square and saw the 'pained ladies'. Then we went on to Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow, before walking up to the bay just west of Fort Mason. We walked over seven miles! So after some lunch we rode the cable-car back to Market Street. We had quite a long wait in the queue, but the ride was quite exiting since we were sat outside at the front.<br />
        We then walked round the shops (I bought a belt in Macy's), before going to an Italian restaurant. We only gave them a 10% tip since they served the coffee before the desert!</p>
        <p>26 November 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>We were up early this morning and at the cafe next to the hotel for breakfast before they had squeezed the oranges! So we caught an earlier BART train than we had planned. We arrived at Richmond a few minutes before the earlier train was due. Then it was a few minutes late and so we were able to catch it, in spite of having bought a ticket for the later train. Luckily the Amtrak trains have wi-fi and so I could send a message to Victoria. She then collected us from Davis station.<br />
        Austin and Brandon were waiting for us when we got to Catalina Drive. We had some lunch and thEn went for a walk around the local park areas. Then playing with Austin tired us out!</p>
        <p>27 November 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Our first Thanksgiving. We slept quite well and so did not get up very early for our pancake breakfast. The morning was spent not doing very much. But after lunch w went for a walk in the sunshine, visiting a couple of playgrounds. Meanwhile, the Turkey was cooking. We then had pomelo as a started, a turkey dinner and pumpkin pie. For most of the day the TV was showing the various football matches that were being played across the country.</p>
        <p>28 November 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Brandon left for Thailand early this morning, before we got up. So we had a late breakfast, followed by a walk into downtown Davis. There we had some lunch before spending longer than planned in a playground! We walked back via a supermarket, drank tea in the back porch and then swept up leaves in the back and the front, leaving them in piles in the road. I then watched a film before we went to bed.</p>
        <p>29 November 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>It rained for most of the day today, so we stayed in. We got up late and after breakfast spoke with Paul et al. Then we did some washing and played with Austin or read for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>30 November 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>It didn't rain as much today, although we still had a lazy day. We got up late and played with Austin this morning. Then we went firstly to Target and then to Nugget. The first to look for some wellie boots for Austin (but they didn't have any) and to buy two jumpers, a dressing gown and a hair dryer for Victoria. We also bought some paints for Austin. At Nugget we bought some groceries, including a jar of for a sauce to use with the left over turkey. We managed to prevent Austin from going to sleep. Although he did not eat much lunch, he did quite well for dinner, doing some painting beforehand. Then he had a relatively early bath before stories and bed. Victoria's cold, however, is quite heavy.</p>
