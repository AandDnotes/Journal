        <p>1 June 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After breakfast and a shower, my birthday started with a walk to Steyning. V&amp;B and P&amp;K went to the park, while I went to buy a newspaper and some milk. I met them in the park, before setting off for home, leaving them in the park, to put the chicken in the oven. After lunch we had a lazy afternoon, watching the children play. Before tea I took the children into the garden and did a lot of running around. P&amp;K left after tea.</p>
        <p>2 June 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Another busy day with Austin. We started by taking him to Tesco and M&amp;S and then on to Shoreham Airport. There we sat outside and saw planes taking off. After lunch we took Austin back to M&amp;S (to change something for Victoria) and then on to Dad's to cut his grass. We then brought Dad back for a cup of tea and to say goodbye to Victoria. Victoria collected Bay.</p>
        <p>3 June 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>We again spent a lot of time looking after Austin while V&amp;B worked and sorted out their currency transfer. Their house sale completed, the money was transferred into their current account and they moved it into their US account.<br />
        I spent some time producing an exercise for pupils at the school careers talk.<br />
        After dinner I went to the Methodist Church to a talk on the Rosetta mission to a comet. It was very well attended and very interesting.</p>
        <p>4 June 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Once again we spent most of he day looking after Austin while V&amp;B packed their belongings into their bags.</p>
        <p>5 June 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>So the big day arrived. At 8:15 the taxi arrived and Austin was loaded, along with a boot full of bags. Austin was very exited about going in a 'big black car'.<br />
        After they drove away we had breakfast and then went off to Dad's to compile his shopping list. We then went to Sainsbury's and M&amp;S to do the weekly shop. Then I cut the front grass while Angela went to Bay's. Later I did the weekly and monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>6 June 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Apart from finding places to put things away, I vacuumed out Victoria's car before lunch. After lunch I tried to stop the dishwasher connection from leaking, but failed. So I e-mailed Tony! Then I cut half the back grass. Prior to that we decided to let Sam out. After a little exploration of the garden she went out of the side gate, across the front and into Mel's front garden. I retrieved her and brought her back in through the front door. She went back out into the garden, but this time went over the fence into the wood. She disappear for some time, but eventually came back through the garage, since the door was open. Then, while partially up the tree, Lily arrived and they had a stand-off. Eventually Lily chased Sam into the house.<br />
        After dinner I walked up to the flying site, just as most people were leaving the barbecue and fun fly evening.</p>
        <p>7 June 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The day started mopping up water that hD leaked from the dishwasher connection. Angela then spent most of the day in the garden and Sam had a good explore. Meanwhile I tidied up the accounts and mailed Victoria a scan of the mail that had arrived for them. After lunch I managed to get the rest of the back grass cut and then completed the first chapter of 'The Adventures of Sam Cat'. However, I need to improve the front cover and the table of contents.<br />
        We organised to meet P&amp;K in Brighton tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>8 June 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Well, what a splendid day! We caught the 08:56 Coastliner bus from Shoreham this morning and arrived at Brighton Pier at 09:20, ten minutes before we had arranged to meet Paul et al. So we walked along Madeira Drive and arrived at the 'cheap' end just as they drove up. Paul went off to his meeting and the rest of us had coffee in a children's playground, complete with water spouts! Rowan got very wet, but thoroughly enjoyed herself. We then walked along Madeira Drive, up and down the pier and then over to an Italian restaurant near the Pavilion. After a long lunch we walked into the Pavilion gardens and Paul came up. He had eaten lunch with some friends in the cafe there. We then had a slow walk along the beach/promenade back to their car. We got home at about 6:30 and the sun shone all day.<br />
        After tea we spoke with Victoria in California for the first time in their rented apartment. It was excellent video and sound.</p>
        <p>9 June 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning we took the old fridge from the garage to the tip, along with a few other bits and pieces. On the way we called into B&amp;Q to pick up some paint charts and a couple of sample pots. From the tip we went to Dad's to change his bed and do his washing. He still had not changed his underwire (or anything else for that matter)!<br />
        After lunch we moved the old fridge into the garage and sorted out a few things. Then I did a little more to my model. We were waiting to start cooking until Tony had been to fix the leak, but he was quite late, so we started grilling some lamb chops and smoked ourselves out! We might limit our use. of the grill.<br />
        I put the two colours on the wall and we are now even more unsure.</p>
        <p>10 June 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Today is Bay's birthday (99 today), so we walked to Steyning and then on to Bay's. It was lunchtime by the time we got home. After lunch Alan phoned to say that Vera had died. I then made a start on painting the kitchen! It took a long time to put watered down paint around the edges on the window wall and filling the spaces between. However, I did wedge the ceiling lights and painted around two of them. But I think it is going to take a long time to decorate the room.</p>
        <p>11 June 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>This morning I completed putting a fist coat of watered down emulsion on the bare plaster on the walls. Then I had an early lunch and took Dad to Worthing Hospital to have his first cataract removed. His appointment was at one o'clock and he was first in the queue, so he was done by three. I took him home, but he felt a bit wobbly. So I went off to B&amp;Q to buy some paint and a glass shelf and then packed his bag and took him home.<br />
        After dinner, Bay phoned to say that she was at the surgery, with a swollen leg. Angela went off to find her! She was still at the surgery, but needs to go back tomorrow and to Worthing Hospital on Friday for an ultra-scan.</p>
        <p>12 June 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>The day started by Angela taking Bay to the surgery to have a blood sample taken. Meanwhile, Dad sat and looked at some of my modelling magazines and I sheeted the underside of the fuselage of my model. When Angela got back we made some lunch and set off for Dad's to eat it. Then Angela went shopping while I cut Dad's grass.<br />
        After dinner I sold Victoria' car for &#163;700.</p>
        <p>13 June 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning I managed to get up to the flying site. There were only a few people there and I managed to get about four flights in before needed to come home. My landings are still pretty poor.<br />
        After lunch we took Bay to the hospital. I went into Worthing to pay money into Austin's account and then waited for them to finish. Afterwards we went to Dad's for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>14 June 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Most of my day seemed to be spent painting the kitchen ceiling. It is now a creamy colour, but should start to turn white tomorrow if I can put on the first coat. Angela spent most of the day working in the garden, although we did walk to the Beeding newsagent after breakfast.<br />
        On my model I did manage to prepare the the parts for the front of the fuselage. Glueing them together, however, is likely to be difficult.</p>
        <p>15 June 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Another day painting! After a walk to the newsagents I put a coat of white paint on the kitchen ceiling. Although I only managed to get the edges done before lunch, partly because Giles called to show me his quad-copter. He put it together from the individual modules, which includes an Adrucopter controller. After lunch I used Victoria's roller to paint the rest of the ceiling. We also spoke with Paul, who has made an offer on the house in Holland and is going over next weekend so as to spend a day with the Rotterdam company on Monday. Rowan said a lot, but it is difficult to understand her.<br />
        Later we talked with Victoria and Austin. They have also made an offer on a house, but doubt that they will get it, since four other offers have also been made.</p>
        <p>16 June 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I gave the kitchen ceiling a second coat of white paint. Hopefully that will be sufficient. After lunch I cleaned the roller and then went over to Dad's. He had forgotten that I said I would be visiting. I rearranged his bed cloths, put on his washing (after getting him to change his trousers), walked to the surgery and then the chemists to get his tablets and phoned Beryl.<br />
        When I got home I glued the front pieces of the fuselage, including the firewall, on my model. I also finally worked out how to delete and add iBooks to the iPad. It has to be done via iBooks on Hyde Mac, then synch'd with the iPad.</p>
        <p>17 June 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning I update my RC blog and then fitted the glass shelf under the clock. It took longer than expected, since it took a while to decide how best to fit it. After lunch I started preparing the walls. Unfortunately, the callk container was too long to fit my holder. So I had to use it by pushing the bottom until I had used enough to cut the bottom off the container until it would fit in my holder. Eventually I completed the filling on the walls and the calking around the upstanding, under the window sill and down the side of the door frame.</p>
        <p>18 June 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Angela went walking with her walking group while I continued preparing the kitchen for painting. However, it took some time to get the sockets screwed back. After lunch we went to Dunelm-Mill and to B&amp;Q in Shoreham. We bought a towel rail, kitchen roll holder, wooden spoon pot, cheese grater, saucepan and two pillows. Then we got a tin of gloss paint. Otherwise, I did a little work on my model.</p>
        <p>19 June 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We were a little late setting off for the weekly shop, but it was completed quite quickly, even though we stopped for a coffee in M&amp;S. We also called in to Dunelm Mill to see if we could change the saucepan we had bought for a smaller one. But they did not have a smaller version with a lid. After lunch, while Angela went to Bay's to take her shopping and do some gardening, I continued preparing the kitchen for painting. Although it doesn't seem much, I am pleased with what I did, including cleaning the edge of the glass on the back door. Hopefully tomorrow I can start painting the woodwork.</p>
        <p>20 June 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning I went up to the flying site. Chris was cutting the grass, so Steve, John and I had to wait about half an hour before we could fly. I had an interesting chat with Steve, who is a physicist/engineer and spent 15 years at CERN designing power supplies. I on,y managed one decent landing, although then I ran out of strip!<br />
        After lunch I started painting the woodwork in huge kitchen. It took me from 2:30 to about 6:30. And I will need to give the back door another coat.<br />
        Angela spent the afternoon in the garden, but then felt unwell and did not have any dinner.</p>
        <p>21 June 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After the usual walk to the newsagents and the weekly update of the accounts, I spent the rest of the day working on painting the edges of the walls. Hopefully, tomorrow I will finish the edges and roller the rest. Meanwhile, Angela seems to have recovered and worked in the garden, again.</p>
        <p>22 June 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Usual walk to the newsagents, followed by painting again in the kitchen. I finished the first coat on the walls by lunch time. After lunch I washed the rollers and we went to Dad's. There, Angela changed his bed and vacuumed around, while I mowed his grass. After a chat with Victoria (and Austin) and then dinner, I put a little calk around the window, prior to putting a second coat on the walls tomorrow.</p>
        <p>23 June 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Most of the day was spent putting a second coat of paint on the kitchen walls! Meanwhile Angela did some shopping in Steyning and cut the front and back grass (plus some other gardening).</p>
        <p>24 June 2014<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The painting is finally finished! This morning I gave a second coat of gloss to the back door and the window sill.i also re-hung the internal door. Tomorrow I can put back the shelf etc.<br />
        After lunch we took Bay into Worthing to open a 1-2-3 account and an ISA. It took all afternoon!</p>
        <p>25 June 2014<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>The morning saw the reinstatement of 'things on the walls' in the kitchen, including the new towel rail. I then prepared some material for the Worthing College careers day next Wednesday, before doing a little work on my model. Meanwhile, Angela went walking with her friends. After lunch we did the weekly shop, including looking at blinds in Next. It was quite late before we finished our dinner, although Angela had a long phone call between her starter and main course and we spoke with Paul (and Rowan) before we had our dessert. They have had an offer accepted on the house in Holland and Paul has been offered a job in Rotterdam, although he is still negotiating on salary.</p>
        <p>26 June 2014<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We had a tiring day, driving to Reading for Aunt Vera's funeral. Dad was in the 'the wrong trousers' when we arrived and his dark suit was too small. So we were 15 minutes later leaving than I had intended. We arrived at the service about five minutes late, although John and Laura arrived after us. We then went for another 15 minute drive to a pub on the outskirts of Henley, where Beryl had arranged for some lunch to be served. So we left home just before nine and arrived back at six, having driven 180 miles!</p>
        <p>27 June 2014<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I started by logging my past STEM activities and then checked Angela's pension income for 2012/13, since HMRC have revised the amount in her tax return. Then I managed to do a little on my model before lunch and a little after lunch. Meanwhile, Angela washed the car! Then we walked around to Bay's to take her a cake that Angela had bought for her in Steyning. I listed her direct debits for transfer to her new Santander account.</p>
        <p>28 June 2014<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Not a very eventful day. The heavy showers stopped in time for us to walk to the newsagents and allowed Angela to wash some flower pots. Meanwhile I did the weekly accounts and then helped Angela do her WI gift aid claim. During the day I managed to do some more to my model, including putting some balsa filler on the fuselage and on the wings. I also started sanding the fuselage. We did, however, discover that the amount of state pension that we had entered on Angela's tax return was wrong; I had missed one payment! So we do have to pay some money back.</p>
        <p>29 June 2014<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Another quiet day. The usual walk to the Beeding newsagent, followed by more filling and sanding of the fuselage of my model. I then made a start on the wing fixing, including making something to cut threads of the right size from an old bolt.</p>
        <p>30 June 2014<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>I spent the morning at the flying site. I arrived at 9:30 and took down the fence. Luckily three other people arrived at or just after 11:30, just as I was preparing to leave. The wind was quite strong and gusty, but my first two landings worked very well. However, the rest were either bouncy or off the strip. In fact, the firewall and the base behind it have been damaged. So the whole front end will need rebuilding!<br />
        After lunch we went to Next at Shoreham and bought a new rug for the sitting room with the money that Dad had given us. We then went on to Dad's to change his bed and do his washing. When we got home we swapped the beds in the spare bedrooms.</p>
