        <p>Wednesday 1st June</p>
        <p>My birthday! Cards arrived from Victoria, Paul and Alan during the day. Unfortunately Angela was not feeling very well and went back to bed after breakfast. So after a shower I went round to Bay's to reset her clocks after the power cut. Then I dealt with e-mails and made lunch (including stewed rhubarb and custard). Angela was feeling better and so got up for lunch. After washing up I tried out the crack test kit that had arrived during the morning. I used it on the nearside spindle and it has shown a small crack. I ordered a polising kit to see if I can polish it out. After an early tea we went to Wiston House for a talk on CERN. It was very good.</p>
        <p>Thursday 2nd June</p>
        <p>Weekly shopping day. So it was after lunch that I did a crack test on the other spindle. It too is showing signs of a crack underneath at the root of the spindle! I also sent a scan of my DBS to George so that they can be sent on to the school at which we are doing an Energy Watch workshop. Meanwhile Angela took shopping to Bay and Philip. After an early dinner I went to Steyning Library to a talk on AI. Interesting, but more about showing what has been done recently and plugging his books.</p>
        <p>Friday 3rd June</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning 'crafting' a reply to Bronagh and sending a reply to Peter Cole about my stub axles. I also paid Dad's gardener. After lunch we cut the grass and the hedge at the bottom of the garden. Later I mailed Eric Worpe, who, according to Peter, can advise on my possilby cracked spindles.</p>
        <p>Saturday 4th June</p>
        <p>The outside temperature was rising a little as we returned from the Beeding Newsagents this morning, even though it didn't seem like June. After coffee and a shower it was time to make an early lunch so that we could go to a concert at the Steyning Centre as part of the Festival. The performers were a recorder player (recent Young Musician of the Year) and a harpsicordist. They were both excellent musicians and played some dazzling tunes. By the time we got home it was quite warm, although the sun struggled to peek through the cloud. Angela went into the garden and I did the weekly and monthly accounts. I also e-mailed a possible supplier of stub axle spindles (in Canada!) and someone in Devon who might be able to supply and fit spindles if I get the stub axles to him. I'm hoping that the combined price of getting spindles from Canada and getting Eric in Guildford to fit them turns out cheaper, since I think that Eric might be a good contact to have.</p>
        <p>Sunday 5th June The newsagents at Beeding had no Telegraphs left and no longer top up mobile phones. So I walked on to the petrol station, which had both. Before lunch I started cleaning the facias and guttering, continuing after lunch. However, I only managed to do the section between the garage and the front door and to brush down the back. It is slow work at any time, but it was very hot. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden. We then spoke with Victoria and then with Paul. Rowan was very chatty.</p>
        <p>Monday 6th June</p>
        <p>We started by going to Dad's. Angela helped him turn his bed cloths while I filled his pill box. After coffee I spent some time making video clips of him talking about his various jobs. Unfortunately I later found that I had coverred the microphone! So none were of any use. After lunch Anglea worked in the garden and I washed the facias and guttering at the back, including up into the apex.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 7th June</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to Steyning and then worked in the garden, I completed cleaning the the facias and guttering at the front and down the side of the garage. After lunch (we had our main meal at lunchtime) I made the parts for the second side of the rudder bars for the Moth. I also received the title and synopsis from Yang Gao and sent them on to Hamish. Later I went to crawley for the last IET talk in the season. It was about policy in the NHS with regard to the purchasing, use and maintenance of equipment and the use of technology to change the way healthcare works.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 8th June</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI friends to Washington, I got up on the garage roof and cleaned the facia on the apex. I also ordered new European Health Insurance Cards for us both and prompted Bob Grunau in Canada. He replied and I ordered spindles, including an extra set for Eric in Guildford. After lunch I got on the shed roof and cleaned the facias around the shed. I then spent quite a long time trying to get a pencil torch to work. In the end I used the blowlamp to solder the pedals to their tubes.</p>
        <p>Thursday 9th June</p>
        <p>This morning's shopping was done fairly quickly, in spite of the need to evacuate M&amp;S due to a fire alarm! After lunch, while Angela went to Philips and to Bay's, I e-mailed Eric in Guildford about the 'cupped' washers on the spindles, cleaned the pencil torch so as to get it working and soldered together the pieces of the other rudder bar. I also created another 'notebook' page, this time on TC wiring.</p>
        <p>Friday 10th June</p>
        <p>Auntie Bay's 101st Birthday! But I got up at 6:30 so as to get to Moulescoomb by 8:40 (although I didn't really need to be there until 9:00). It was teh EEP Robotics Day. Originally there were to be five schools taking part, but only three were expected and only two turned up! Nevertheless it was a good day. We finished at about 2:15 and I got home at 2:45. After a while we went round to Bay's, taking her present, her cards and a birthday cake. I replaced her bird table with her new one (her present), had some tea and cake and dug up some bulbs.</p>
        <p>Saturday 11th June</p>
        <p>We both walked to the newsagents in Beeding this morning. Then Angela went to Tesco to buy food for the lunch club on Monday while I did the weekly accounts and reconciled them against the bank statement. After lunch Angela went in the garden and I went into the garage. Eric from Guildford may be able to call on Thursday, so I cleaned the stub axles, cupped washers and hub studs/nuts in a little petrol. The flattened washer is quite damaged, so I will need to buy a new one from the Octagon Club, either one with a 3/4&quot; hole (for a TD) or one for a TC that Eric can bore out. I also started checking the Barefoot presentation to see if it has been modified since I last downloaded it.</p>
        <p>Sunday 12th June</p>
        <p>I walked to Beeding, in the rain, on my own this morning. The rain stopped just as I got home! I spent the morning removing the green paint from the knuckles of the stub axles (using the blade of a screwdriver and some wire wool), prior to them having their spindles replaced. After lunch I continued checking the Barefoot slides for changes and checked the Scratch/Arduino test set up. Later we spoke to Paul (and Rowan), but then Victoria wanted to finish breakfast and go for a walk before we talked. So they called just as we were going to dish up dinner. So we ate late!</p>
        <p>Monday 13th June</p>
        <p>The day started by taking Angela, three large trifles and a big bag of chicken thighs down to the church, ready to start cooking for the lunch club. From there I went to George's. Hamish was also there so that we could work out how to deliver the Energy Watch workshop in one hour and check the equipment that we would need. We also started talking to George about his Schools Liaison Officer contacts. From there I went to Dad's, getting there just as he was dishing up his lunch. I ate a sandwich that I had bought in his corner shop, then changed his bed and put on his washing. Later I started looking at the Barefoot slides and agreed to attend teh IET Global Comunity Volunteer's Conference on Friday and Saturday morning at Savoy Place. Sathish was due to go, but now cannot.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 14th June</p>
        <p>It seems to have been a busy day with little to show for it. The new spindles arrived from Canada, so I e-mailed Bob (in Canada) to tell him and e-mailed Eric (in Guildford) to tell him of the difficulties I have with him collecting the stub axles on Thursday. I also measured the diameters of the old spindles (in two places) and compared them to one of the new spindles. Luckily they are the same to within a couple of thou, so hopefully the hubs will go on easily. Then I booked coach tickets from Brighton to London (the outbound of which were more expensive than they were yesterday) and printed some pages from Google Maps. In between these things, Angela went to a funeral at Botolphs church and worked in the garden, I ordered castle nuts for the fatter spindles, plus a few other things from the Octagon Club and I worked through the Barefoot slides. I have an assistant for the workshop, but it is his first and he doesn't seem to be confident enough to do any of the presenting.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 15th June</p>
        <p>After a shower I went through the Barefoot slides before cutting the front grass and half the back grass. Meanwhile Angela had been walking with ther WI friends, going to Devil's Dyke. She arrived home just as I had finished preparing lunch. Afterwards I changed and went to Lyminster Primary school to run a Barefoot workshop. There were nine teachers. I got home at about 3:30, by which time Angela had finished cutting the grass.</p>
        <p>Thursday 16th June</p>
        <p>The day started with the weekly shopping trip to Holmebush and ended in a posh hotel on the south bank of the Thames by Westminster Bridge! We did the shopping quite quickly and after lunch at the usual time Angela drove me to Shoreham. I caught the 700 bus into Brighton and then the National Express coach to Victoria Coach Station. To my surprise we went via Falmer, Hickstead and Gatwick. There were only about four pasengers from Brighton, all of whom got off at or before Gatwick. Then a dozen got on, mostly Chinese. The coach was 15 minutes late leaving Brighton (having arrived late) and nearly half an hour late arriving at Victoria. I walked to the main line station and caught the tube to Westminster, walked across the bridge and checked into the Park Plaza hotel. The IET are paying the bill, although I'm not sure they will be pleased with my dinner bill. Since it was thundering I ate in teh hotel. Good, but expensive.</p>
        <p>Friday 17th June</p>
        <p>Up at 6:30, shower, breakfast and off to Savoy Place to the IET Community Volunteers Conference. Discussions with other delegates about their problems and some of their solutions was very interesting. Probably more so than the presentations, although I did try to take notes. After the evening reception (and more discussions) I walked back to the hotel, getting there at 9 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Saturday 18th June</p>
        <p>Another 6:30 start. After checking out of the hotel I walked to Savoy Place, but was a little early. The morning was spent mainly in a break-out group and in discussions with various people. I now just need to write up a report for the Sussex LN committee. After a buffet lunch I left at about 1:45, walked to Embankment underground station and caught the tube to Victoria, from where I walked to the coach station. The coach left a little late, arrived a little later and then the 700 bus got a flat tyre! Angela picked me up from the Swiss Cottage pub car park and we weere home by 6:45.</p>
        <p>Sunday 19th June</p>
        <p>After walking to Beeding for a newspaper, Angela went on to church and I collected together the stub axles and new bits and went off to meet Eric at Rowhook. Unfortunately the pub was closed, so we talked in the car park. He had come in his TC. I got home just before lunch, seeing Anglea outside the church and giving her a lift home. After lunch I checked the presentation and Scratch simulation for tomorrow's visit to Steyning Grammar before we talked to firstly Rowan and then Austin.</p>
        <p>Monday 20th June</p>
        <p>It is one year to the day since I bought the TC! It is a pity that it has been on axle stands for the past three weeks, since this has prevented me from clocking up 600 miles in the year (I have only driven the car 560 miles). We went over to Dad's firly early and got back for an early lunch. I then went to Steyning Grammar to help with their 'Futures Day'. I spoke to a dozen lower sixth formers about engineering, and process control in particular. I took my tank control simulation and got them to try manual control. When I got home (at about 2:15) I made my 'knotted strings' for the Energy Watch workshop tomorrow and did the accounts. Angela had dropped me at Steyning Grammar and later went to her WI meeting at the Steyning Centre, leaving the car in the car park there. I walked from the school to the car and brought it home. When Angela got home she spent most of the rest of the afternoon and evening sorting out her accounts.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 21st June</p>
        <p>An early start (up at 6:30) to go to Davison School for the Worthing and Adur Eco-Summit. We ran three workshops based on Energy Watch. It all seemed to go quite well. I got home just after four and caught up on e-mail. Meanwhile, Angela did housework, worked in the garden and did washing.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 22nd June</p>
        <p>It seems crazy that the end of June is fast approaching and summer doesn't really seem to have started. Angela went off walking this morning in the drizzle and I started sorting out my notes from the IET Volunteers Conference. During the morning I kept getting distracted trying to find things on the IET web sites and getting frustrated when, every time I changed sites, I had to log in again. However, trying to log into the IET.tv site just returned me to the IET main site! After lunch I finally managed to complete my notes and sent it to the Sussex LN committee along with a possible set of actions. During the day I also had some correspondence with Sarah at Steyning Grammar about a careers event in October. I started making notes on an 'Engineers Change the World' talk.</p>
        <p>Thursday 23rd June</p>
        <p>EU referendum day! In spite of the overnight thunder storms it was only a little drizzly this morning. More like low cloud. Even though we went to the polling station (in the pub in Bramber) before going to Dad's, we managed to get the shopping at Holmebush done in good time. In fact we were home and had lunch made in time to watch the lunchtime news. Afterwards, Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay and I did some modelling. I re-soldered a rudder pedal on one end of the linking bar and finished assembling the central frame. I then spent some time updating my Tiger Moth Build web page.</p>
        <p>Friday 24th June</p>
        <p>When we got up this morning I found it hard to believe that 52% of those who voted yesterday voted to leave the EU! Most of the TV and radio today seems to have been about the result and the consequences. So we spent most of the day in the garden. I finished cleaning the gutters and facias (at the wood end of the bungalow) and then trimmed several bushes (with hedge trimmer / seceteurs / loppers / saw). I also checked how much roofing felt and paint I had for the shed. Just enough.</p>
        <p>Saturday 25th June</p>
        <p>Rather than walking to the newsagents, as usual on a Saturday morning, we went to the model shop for bolts, washers and screws, to Sainsbuy's for a paper and to B&amp;Q for some roofing nails. We then went on to Dad's and waited for Richard and Michelle to arrive, which they did just after 11 o'clock. They stayed for about an hour before heading for the beach! They were armed with wellies as well as sandels, which was good, because we had some heavy showers (including thunder). After lunch, while Angela worked in the garden, I took the the blade of the hedge trimmer apart, cleaned it and put it back together with two new bolts. The originals had fallen out! Afterwards I did the weekly accounts, but while I was searching for a place to put the money from a maturing bond we had a call from Bay. Her TV would not work. So I went round and replaced the baterries in her remote control.</p>
        <p>Sunday 26th June</p>
        <p>We started with the usual walk to the Beeding newsagents. While Angela was at church I read the paper and then started trying to work out how to fix the central frame into the fuselage. After lunch I started making the pieces needed to screw the frame in place, while Angela worked in the garden. Later we spoke firstly with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 27th June</p>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by going to Dad's, as usual on a Monday, to change his bed and do his washing. Since it was forcast to be the driest day this week I decided to re-roof the shed. So when we got back I stripped the roof before lunch and nailed on new felt after lunch. Luckily I found that I could reach the top of the roof by standing on the garden kneeler, which just fits down each side. However, it was tight and my left arm and hand has gone a little numb! While I worked on the shed, Angela cut the grass, front and back.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 28th June</p>
        <p>The forecast was for rain during the afternoon. So I spent the morning painting the shed. Meanwhile Angela went to Steyning and worked in the garden. Being in need of a rest, I spent the afternoon working on the Moth. I drilled large holes in the sides of the central frame so as to reduce its weight and added small tongues to sit above the blocks that I have added to the frame. These will allow the frame to be screwed in place.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 29th June</p>
        <p>Today was the Big Bang South East at Ardingly. So I was up at six and left by 7:25. Even then, I only just got there in time. I was judging the Intermediate Engineering projects. With Simon we were suposed to rate five projects, but two did not show. So we had time to have a look around. There were 8,500 children! I left towards the end of the presentations and got home at 2:30. Meanwhile, Angela had been walking around Parham (they got lost) and then went to Bay's. When I got home I checked e-mail and then fixed the central frame into the fuselage of the Moth.</p>
        <p>Thursday 30th June</p>
        <p>We started as usual by going shopping. We started fairly early and so finished comparatively early. While Angela then took their shopping to Philip and Bay, I prepared for this evening's IET committee meeting. Nigel Fine was there when I arrived and made a good impression.</p>
