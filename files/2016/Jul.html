        <p>Friday 1st July</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent e-mailing following last night's committee meeting while Angela went to Steyning. After lunch I did some calculations for rudder movement on the Moth. I decided that the rudder bars need to move more, since as it is the rudder will only move 11 degrees in each direction. The rear rudder bar seems to be too high and so meets a diagonal on the fuselage too early. I will try lowering the bar, but then the front bar is already higher than the rear one. We also took Bay to the optician, dropping her outside and then collecting her when done. That meant that we spent time at her house drinking tea and chatting. I also completed the expense form for the IET CVC and sent it to Roger.</p>
        <p>Saturday 2nd July</p>
        <p>A busy day. We got up a little early for a Saturday, showered and set off for Guildford. We got to Eric's at about twenty to ten and picked up the renovated stub axles. We then went back along the A25 to the park and ride at Merrow and caught the bus into Guildford. We had coffee in Debenhams, overlooking the river before walking along to the pub where we were thinking of having lunch. Then we walked up to the castle and around its gardens before going back to the pub. But we wanted to sit outside and they only servered burgers and sandwaiches there, and expensive meals inside. So we walked back up towards the castle and had lunch in an Italian restaurant. It was good. We then got the bus back and drove home, stopping at Halfords at Broadbridge Heath to buy some Hammerite thinners. I then did the weekly accounts before we had a little tea and walked to the Steyning Centre for the Music Society concert. It was different and quite interesting.</p>
        <p>Sunday 3rd July</p>
        <p>Angela was due to give Philip a lift to church this morning, so I walked to the Beeding newsagents alone. Then I spent the morning working on the stub axles. I fitted the new steering stop bolts after cleaning out the holes with a tap. Then I discovered that the two new castellated nuts were both left-hand thread! So I took a photo of them (and their labled bags) and e-mailed the Octagon Club. Then I cleaned the stub axles with Hammerite thinners and applied one coat of green paint. After lunch, about two and a half hours after finishing the first coat, the paint was touch dry (just), so I applied a second coat. Later we spoke with Paul (and Rowan) before dinner and with Victoria (and Austin) after dinner.</p>
        <p>Monday 4th July</p>
        <p>Being Monday we started by going over to Dad's to turn his bedcloths over and fill his pill box. From there we went to M&amp;S to see if we could open an ISA, but we did not have enough pieces of identification with us. So we made an appointment to see them tomorrow. After lunch Angela went into the garden and I went into the garage to put the stub axles back on the TC, this time on the correct side. Initially on the off side I had difficulty getting the cotter pin into the hole, then found that the stub axle was fouling on the axle. Eric had warned about this (the originals were concave behind the spindle) so I tried filing some metal off the axle, but ended up using the angle grinder. However, on the near side the kingpin would not go through the eye in the axle, even though the original kingpin (now on the off side) would fit. After filing the inside of the eye I got it to fit, but did not have time to finish it.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 5th July</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I started work on the TC, getting the off-side stub axle on before we had to go to M&amp;S to open a new ISA. That took an hour (after we got there) and so we had a quick lunch there before going on to Dad's to take him to the optician in Lancing. His prescription has not changed and his cateract had also not changed (not that he wants it to be operated on). When we got home Angela went in the garden and I went back into the garage. I had to file out the eye on the near-side of the axle so that the kingpin (which had previously been on the off-side) would fit. It also took a while to get the shims right. The off-side cotter pin needed filing down (as expected) so as to fit, but the near-side cotter slid further in, requiring the domed nut to be unscrewed quite some way. I then needed to put washers on the other side. After fitting the two stub axles I cleaned up the other bolts needed to reassemble the other parts.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 6th July</p>
        <p>First thing this morning I set off to B&amp;Q to get boiler descaler and inhibitor and then to Halfords to get some copper grease. Meanwhile, Angela went walking around Partridge Green. When I got home I refitted the brake backplates and connected the steering links. Then I knocked on the hubs, only to find that I didn't have a socket large enough to fit the securing nuts! I couldn't find anyone locally that had one, so ordered a socket online. Then I painted teh shed at the bottom of the garden.</p>
        <p>Thursday 7th July</p>
        <p>A very long day. We set off a little earlier than usual on our weekly shopping trip and managed to get home for lunch at the usual time. The train that I had planned to catch was cancelled, so Angela took me to Shoreham to catch an earlier train. The journey was straight forward, but it meant that I had longer to spend in the Faraday Centre at Savoy Place. I was there to attend the IET CC-UK Roadshow. There were not many attendees and was really just a discussion about problems faced by Local Networks. The (earlier) train that I would have caught home was also cancelled, so I had to wait for the the 10:17, but it was delayed by 15 minutes. All the trains around it were either cancelled or delayed. I got to Shoreham at about midnight and it was nearly 1am before we went to bed!</p>
        <p>Friday 8th July</p>
        <p>An early start after a late night! George, Hamish and I ran two Energy Watch workshops at Ormiston school and so I had to get to Hamish's by 8:15. It all seemed to work quite well and was George's last event before he moves to London. Afterwards we sorted out all the equipment and documents. When I got home I did the monthly accounts. Meanwhile, Angela was helping at a 'messy church' event.</p>
        <p>Saturday 9th July</p>
        <p>While Angela went into Worthing to do her lunch club shopping I walked to Beeding to buy a paper and then did the weekly accounts (and reconciled the bank statement). Then the postman arrived, but no socket! So I went to see Neil, who had a socket that fitted, which happend to be the same marked size as one I had that would not fit! I also borrowed his torque wrench, since mine did not seem to be working properly. So I put on both nuts, discovering that 'click' type torque wrenches do not work for left-hand threads! So I checked the torque needed to undo it. However, in both cases I needed to back off the castellated nut. But then I discovered that the near-side hub would not turn! Even when I undid the nut, the hub was stiff to turn. So I took off both hubs to look for differences, but couldn't really see any. I e-mailed Eric for advice.</p>
        <p>Sunday 10th July</p>
        <p>While Angela gave Phillip a lift to church I walked, in the drizzle, to the newsagents in Beeding. Lter I printed documents for our trip to Rotterdam and looked up train times from Schiphol to Rotterdam. Then I continued my investigation of the seized hub on the TC. Eric had suggested that the oil seal may not be fully seated or that the spacer was worn. Clearly the dimentions of the refurbished stub axle is not quite the same as it was. I measured the gap between the hub and the stub axle, but could not get the feeler gauge down past the seal. So I tried tapping the oil seal in further, but it didn't move. Then I noticed that the spacer had a rebate in the rear surface, whereas the spacer on the other hub (the one that rotates) did not. I sent photos of the seal and the spacer to Eric and looked up the part on the Octagon Club site. We then spoke to both Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 11th July</p>
        <p>Today was lunch club day. So I took Angela, along with her bowls of mousse and bag of frozen food to the church. I then made a few measurements on the stub axles before going to Dad's. I helped him change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. I then cut his box hedge before we cooked some fish and chips. After lunch I recoded him talking about his jobs. It took a while for him to put them in the right chronological order. Then he repeated the same story in the two recordings that we made! When I got home I e-mailed Eric about the hubs, and sent requests to a couple of people about awarding prizes at Brighton.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 12th July</p>
        <p>Angela was busy as usual; doing two lots of washing and going down to Steyning in the morning, going to a WI committee meeting and working in the garden in the afternoon. Meanwhile I just produced a drawing of the front hub (which required installing XQartz and the latest version of Inkscape). I also ordered an oil seal spacer and a tube spacer from the Octogan Club. However, I also e-mailed people about the Brighton University prize giving.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 13th July</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday in summer, Angela started the day by going walking with her WI friends. Meanwhile I spent most of the morning writing up notes from the CC-UK Roadshow and sending them to the other committee members. I also completed my expenses for that event and sent them to Roger. After lunch we went off to Holmebush to do the weekly shop, a day early. It seems that Wednesday afternoons are quite quiet! From there we went to Dad's to deliver his shopping and then Angela went to Philip's and to Bay's. She was late home, but luckily I was late getting the dinner ready. Both my new socket and the parts for the TC, that I ordered from the Octagon club yesterday, were delivered by the postman just before lunch. The socket fits the fub retaining nuts and the two spacers look as though they will do the job well.</p>
        <p>Thursday 14th July</p>
        <p>We had a fairly gentle start to the day. After a shower we took Sam to the cattery and Angela went to the bank. We then packed our cases, had an early lunch and set off to Gatwick. The flight was on time, we topped up out ovChip cards at Schiphol station and had a bite to eat before catching the fast train to Rotterdam. For some reason we did not need to pay the supplement. So we got to Capelsebrug metro station at 8:30 local time. Paul and Rowan met us there.</p>
        <p>Friday 15th July</p>
        <p>Since the work on the barn is not complete we were sleaping on the floor in Rowan's bedroom. So not a lot of sleep, although Rowan slept until about 6:30, when she got in with us and went back to sleep. After a leisurely breakfast Krista took us to the 'dog beach' and then went on to do some food shopping. We took Flo for a walk (and a swim) before being picked up by Krista and taken back to Akterbroek. We had lunch outside and then I stimmed the grass and helped move the rabit hutch. After dinner we went to the Hook of Holland to a beach. Rowan paddled and made sand castled and Flow chased toys and ran a lot. It took about an hour to get there and get home, so we were quite late home.</p>
        <p>Saturday 16th July</p>
        <p>We started with a late breakfast, then went out into the garden. Paul and I tried leveling a concrete slab that had been lifted by tree roots while Angela cut down some elder and made a compost heap. We also cut some overhanging and dead branches and cut off some tree roots that had been lifted when teh drive was dug up for laying the gas pipe. After a late, snack lunch Rowan and I had a shower while Angela and Krista took Flo for a walk. We then changed and went to the pancake house. We met Greet and Wim there. The pancake house would only accept Dutch credit cards!</p>
        <p>Sunday 17th July</p>
        <p>After another night of little sleep we had an early start. Paul drove us to Schiphol airport, ;eaving just after eight o'clock. The roads were quiet, but the airport was heaving with people. We had a long queue just to drop our bags and get bording passes (I had checked in the night before). Then we hurried through security and passport control and rushed to the gate, which was as far away as it was possible to make it, getting there ten minutes before the flight was due to leave. Only to find that the flight was delayed by half an hour due to 'technical and staff' problems. Again the flight was full, but we got home at one o'clock, having stopped briefly in Steyning to buy a newspaper and some rolls. Angela watered and snipped in the garden while I did the weekly accounts and downloaded details of dividends. Later we talked with Victoria before having a relatively early dinner.</p>
        <p>Monday 18th July</p>
        <p>We started by collecting Sam from the cattery, doing a little shopping on the way. Then I went over to Dad's to 'turn over' his bed clothes and fill his pill box. I also showed him photos from our trip to Paul's. After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I replaced the front hubs on the TC. The new bearing spacer tube and the oil seal spacer did the job and the near-side hub now spins. I then replaced the brake drums and wheels and topped up the oil in the back axle (needing to replace the strap on the tonau area floor). I then started the car and took it for a run. All seemed well.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 19th July</p>
        <p>I started by checking the tightness of the cotter pins and the bolts that hold the backplate and steering links to the stub axles. Then I took the TC to Dad's, via the Bostal, and returned via Coombes. All seemed well and we now have both cars in the garage. I also returned Neil's torque wrench and socket. Angela washed the covers of the terracotta sofa, some of which I ironed and refitted. Otherwise it was a case of updating software on the iMac and Macbook and replying to Sam Davis about the proposed Gift Oversight Group.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 20th July</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking I finished ironing and replacing the covers on the sofa, fixed the mirror on Angela's bike and pumped up the tyres on both bikes. I also experimented with some java script. After lunch Angela did the rest of the ironing and I worked on the Moth. I spent a long time bending another piece of wire to join the elevator control to the joysticks. Then I calculated the movement of the elevator and rudder resulting from the movement of the controls.</p>
        <p>Thursday 21st July</p>
        <p>We started our weekly shopping trip a little later this morning since Angela had to go to the health centre to get more hearing aid batteries for herself and Bay. Dad did not feel well enough to come with us, but, even so, it was two o'clock before we had lunch. Afterwards Angela took Philip's shopping to him, while I sent an update to Eric, and then we both went round to Bay's. I tried to glue the legs back on her kitchen stool. After dinner I reviewed the disbursement requests from Brighton.</p>
        <p>Friday 22nd July</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to Steyning and on to Bay's I cut the front grass and the top lawn at the back. As Angela returned, so I set off in the TC to Terry Minns' retirement lunch. I had to stop at this end of the Long Furlong to put the hood up! From the Eurotherm canteen we went on to a pub at the end of Titnore Lane, sitting outside. I got home at about 3:30, changed and cut the rest of the grass. Anglea had been working in the garden, mainly trimming edges and tidying up flower beds.</p>
        <p>Saturday 23rd July</p>
        <p>Another fine day. We started by walking to the newsagents in Beeding, returning home to sit reading the paper and drinking coffee for a while before starting to prepare for the arrival of our friends. They arrived at ten past twelve, having driven from Burnham on Crouch in Essex. They live in Middlewich, but are on their way back to their house near Limoges in France. They left us at about three o'clock to drive to Southampton to stay with a nephew until Monday, when they catch a ferry from Portsmouth. After we had washed up I wanted to go to Screwfix in Shoreham to buy a Jerry Can (the tank on the TC is leaking from around the sender unit), so we thought that since it was a pleasant, sunny afternoon we could go for a walk. However, after I had bought the can and we got some bread and wine from Lidle next door it was coudy and breezy, so we came home. By then it was sunny again! However, after a cup of tea I siphoned most of the petrol out of the tank into the Jerry Can.</p>
        <p>Sunday 24th July</p>
        <p>Apart from a walk to the Beeding newsagents I spent most of the day removing the fuel sender unit from the TC's tank and cleaning it up. I firstly had to remove the spare wheel carrier. Tomorrow I will order a cork gasket, but today made a cardboard one for the outer cover. Meanwhile Angela went to church and worked in the garden. We spoke with Victoria (and Austin), but Paul et al were at Greet's for a barbecue.</p>
        <p>Monday 25th July</p>
        <p>We did quite well this morning. We started by going to Bay's to 'fix' her oven. She'd had a short power cut and for some reason the main oven timer had set itself to start the oven at 6:00. Consequently it would not turn on. We then went on to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. From there we went to the tip with our old green garden chairs. They had gone powdery and leave green stains on your clothes. From there we went to Speedy Spares and the neighboring garden centre. I bought a sheet of gasket paper and some gasket sealant and Angela bought some seeds. We were home in time for lunch. This afternoon the British Gas man called to service the boiler. It is old (about 26 years), but working well, even if it is inefficient by today's standards. Meanwhile, I made another outer gasket and ordered a new cork gasket. Later wer spoke with Paul et al.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 26th July</p>
        <p>I decided that the gasket sealant that I bought yesterday would not be up to the job and found that a classic car spares outlet in Partridge Green sold Hylomar Blue. So after breakfast we drove to Henfield and walked the remaining two miles along the Downs Link. After buying the sealant we went back to the the Downs Link and to Stan's Bike Shack for a coffee. This week they were using Columbian beans, and tasted very good. We got home for lunch, then worked in the garden. I also started experimenting with the videos of Paul's barn.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 27th July</p>
        <p>A day spent doing odds and ends. Angela went walking as usual on a Wednesday morning, while I cleaned up the paint beneath the sender unit, paid Dad's gardener and completed and sent off an article on TC stub axles (actually cracked spindles) to the Octagon Club Bulletin editor. I also finished the video of Paul's barn, modified the photos from our trip to Rotterdam and uploaded them all to the iPad (including udating its applications and OS). Later in the day I helped Angela cut some things down in the garden. After dinner I worked out how to make my TC 'notebook' look better and modified alll the pages.</p>
        <p>Thursday 28th July</p>
        <p>Dad joined us for our food shop this week. Afterwards, Angela took Philip his food and then went to Bay's. Meanwhile I put out my clothes to pack and started writing an article for Main Gear on the history of the TC. Later I checked the car before our journey to Badby tomorrow. I was surprised to find that the oil was quite low.</p>
        <p>Friday 29th July</p>
        <p>We left the cattery at 9:20 this morning and headed for Badby, arriving there at about twenty to one. After a long lunch we went for a walk around a local reservoir and then returned for some tea.</p>
        <p>Saturday 30th July</p>
        <p>Following a very late breakfast we set off on quite a long journey (about an hour) to Kedlestone Hall, near Derby. In fact we had to go around the Derby ring road in order to get there. It was a very impressive house. After a picnic lunch we went for a (short) walk around the grounds, getting back to Badby just before seven.</p>
        <p>Sunday 31st July</p>
        <p>We started with a very late breakfast, eventually leaving Badby just after eleven. We stopped to buy a paper at an M40 service station and then worked our from the M40 to Nuffield Place, just north of Henley. It was an interesting house and garden. After some lunch in their tea room we left a little after three, working our way towards Guildford and then down to Broadbridge Heath because the A24 and A25 were closed for a cycle event. It was 5:45 before we got home! We then spoke to Paul and later to Victoria.</p>
