        <p>Thursday 1st December</p>
        <p>On the way to Dad's this morning I had a call (voice message on my mobile) from Southlands asking me to call them about Dad's appointment next week. But they said it was for my mother, Mrs Katherine Baker! When we got to Dad's I called them, but they couldn't find anything in Dad's records. I was asked to call the Dermatology secretary at Worthing hospital, which I did, but the person I needed to talk to was not in, and they said she would call me tomorrow. However, while walking around Tesco I had a call and they had resolved the problem. We were quite late home, so after lunch, while Angela took the shopping to Philip and Bay, I spoke to Heritage about the Panda insurance, eventually renewing it.</p>
        <p>Friday 2nd December</p>
        <p>Angela had tried to buy Bay a chair to use in her kitchen, so this morning, after she had been to Steyning, we drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Brighton. After coffee in M&amp;S we bought the chair and then caught the bus back to Shoreham, where we had lunch before coming home. Angela then took Bay t the chiropodist and garden centre, while I loaded photos on to the iPad. Then, after tea, I went to the flying club's 'Christmas party' at Worthing Liesure Centre.</p>
        <p>Saturday 3rd December</p>
        <p>Before we had a chance to go out for a newspaper this morning we had a call from Bay. Her paper had not been delivered (the papers arrived late at the newsagents and so would not now been delivered). So she asked if we were going in that direction. So we changed tack and walked to Steying (Angela wanted some other items) and then on to Bay's. We changed a couple of light bulbs (one in the hall ceiling) and added our phone number to her phone's phonebook. We also showed her photos of Paul's barn and of Austin and Juniper. When we got home Angela went into the garden and I did the weekly and and monthly accounts. Afterwards, while Angela was still in the garden, I drained the coolant from the TC and removed the three narrower bore hoses, one of which had been leaking.</p>
        <p>Sunday 4th December</p>
        <p>I had a longer walk to buy a newspaper this morning, since both the newsagents and the petrol station had run out. Angela took Philip to church. After that I did a little more to my Christmas letter and made one of the ply canbane covers on the other side. Later we spoke to both Victoria and Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 5th December</p>
        <p>A busy day. We started by going to M&amp;S and Tesco at Holmbush and Speedy Spares before going to Dad's. We went to M&amp;S for some grapes, but came away with two amarylis and a teapot as well! After going to Speedy Spares to get some radiator hoses and antifreeze we went into the nearby garden centre for a coffee. And came out with socks, a belt and a bird feeder stand! At Dad's we changed his bed, put on his washing and filled his pill box. After lunch I went next door to help Mel print off an attachment to en email. But we failed. Eventually I got her iPad to send the file to their printer, but it was not complete. So she sent the email to me and I printed the attachment. I then unfolded and assembled the travel cot, photographed it and put an advert on Friday-Ad. Then, after an early dinner, we walked to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Golden Years'. It was entertaining.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 6th December</p>
        <p>Not a particularly productive day. Angela had to go down to the butcher to order some turkey for the lunch club (it had not been ordered by those running it) and I finished my draft Christmas letter. After lunch, while Angela was at her WI committee meeting, I produced and printed each of my Christmas letters from the template. Later I drove to Crawley for the IET Sussex LN committee meeting. Firstly we only had frive attendees and secondly the Hawth did not have our booking. Luckily the room was available and they made us some sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 7th December</p>
        <p>This morning I fitted new radiator hoses to the TC and filled it with antifreeze. I thought it should hold eight litres, but it only took six and a half litres. After lunch, while Angela was at table tennis, I started the car and took it for a drive to warm up the coolant. My usual figure of eight was somewhat interrupted due to a traffic queue at the the southern roundabout (so I turned around) and then Steyning High Street was closed due to the late night shopping. However, there was no sign of leaks or a drop in the water level. Later I wrote my Christmas cards.</p>
        <p>Thursday 8th December</p>
        <p>As we arrived in Dad's road this morning so we saw him walking towards the corner shop to get his paper. However, we were soon off to Sainsbury's at Portslade (rather than Tesco at Holmebush) to do the weekly shop. We had coffee there and then took him to Southlands to have the stitches in his ear removed. We dropped Angela near to Holmbush so that she could do the M&amp;S shopping and then meet us at the hospital. Dad's appointment (at midday) was early and we were back int eh car by ten past. But we didn't need to wait too long for Angela. However, it was nearly two o'clock before we finally got home. Angela then took their shopping to Philip and Bay, while I dealt with email. I then prepared an early dinner so that, when Angela returned, I could drive to Crawley for an IET talk on retinal surgery!</p>
        <p>Friday 9th December</p>
        <p>After going down to Steyning, Angela went to Findon and then on to Worthing, mainly to look for boots and get things for the lunch club. I emailed the rest of the IET committee about their role before checking the TC's radiator hoses. I could find no leaks, but topped up the radiator. Then I worked on the Moth. I completed the canbane struts on the starboard side and epoxied them in place. Meanwhile Anglea wrote more Christmas letters.</p>
        <p>Saturday 10th December</p>
        <p>We walked to Beeding bridge and then on to the BP petrol station, since the newsagents had run out of Telegraphs. Then I did the weekly accounts while Angela collected meat for the lunch club and delivered it to the person who will cook it. After lunch I started looking at what I could do for the Moth's engine mount and searched for a suitable motor. Then I took Angela and her lunch club bits to the church and posted the final batch of Christmas cards.</p>
        <p>Sunday 11th December</p>
        <p>The Beeding newsagents had a Telegraph this morning, so I didn't need to walk too far. While Angela was at church I did some more research on a motor for the Moth, but I still don't have enough information to design the engine mount. This afternoon I washed the Panda and we spoke to Paul and Victoria (it is her 40th birthday). We managed to get dinner ready in time to watch the film Paddington.</p>
        <p>Monday 12th December</p>
        <p>A busy day! Angela started by going down to the lunch club to help them get going, while I went for a check-up at the dentist. Then I took Philip to the lunch club (their Christmas event) while Angela finished preparing lunch. After lunch I took Angela to her WI meeting and then collected Philip. he was suposed to be by the bus stop outside the church, but he was still sitting down with his party hat on his head, waiting for his coffee! However, I got him home, went off to M&amp;S and then on to Dad's. We 'turned over' his bed clothes, put on some washing and filled his pill box. Then I went to the corner shop to buy some Christmas cards for him, but they only had single cards. So we wrote those cards that he thought suitable to send and left them on his hall table for him to post tomorrow. Later we went to the WSMGOC Christmas 'do', entertained by the 'Ladies That Boogie'. It was a fun evening.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 13th December</p>
        <p>I don't know how we manage to concoct these busy days. Angela started by catching the bus to Storrington to pay in her WI meeting cash. After lunch she went to Bay's to help her with her Christmas cards while I went to the RCEA talk at Field Place (on Thameslink electrification). I left at the tea break to go to Brighton University, arriving just in time for the pre-FLL meeting. Then I went to Falmer for a talk on electric trains. So I'm 'trained out'.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 14th December</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went to Steyning while I got ready and got out the MG. We then drove to Camelia Botnar (about 13 miles) to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers for coffee. We then all set off for a 30 mile ride around the north Sussex countryside, ending up at the Red Lion in Ashington for lunch. There were about 40 people and, surprisingly, I was the first name out of the 'hat' for the raffle. I won a bottle of Proseco!. We got home at about 3:30. Angela then made some chocolate mousse and mince pies, while I prepared and sent details to Professor Gao at the STAR Labs about her talk next month.</p>
        <p>Thursday 15th December</p>
        <p>We started our weekly shop early this week, expecting it to be busy and parking difficult. It was actually not too bad and, with coffee in the middle, we were back at Dad's by about 12:30. We then went to Lyons Farm to buy a car booster seat for Rowan. Angela also bought some boots. After lunch I had a quieter time while Angela took Bay and Philip their shopping.</p>
        <p>Friday 16th December</p>
        <p>At last a quiet day. Angela walked down to Steyning this morning while I mainly checked email and decided what to do with a maturing NS&amp;I bond. After lunch I cleaned the TC which involved wiping over the paintwork, using window cleaner on the windscreen and dry-wiping under the wings. The underside really needs a wash, but that can wait since it is dry mud. I also checked that the side lights are still just a single bulb and removed the flasher unit for inspection. I also looked at the exhaust fixing to the manifold since I had seen what appeared to be a loose bolt on a photo. In fact all three studs do not seem to be all the way in (they are 7/8&quot; AF). I could loosen the easiest one to access, but could not tighten it. Meanwhile Angela started cleaning the house, so I then washed the floors of the two bathrooms and the front and rear porches. During the morning I had brought down the Christmas decorations from the loft, so this afternoon Angela started hanging up the cards in the hall.</p>
        <p>Saturday 17th December</p>
        <p>The usual walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper was followed by bringing in the Christmas tree. We decided tht it was too big for the usual position in the sitting room and so we put it in the dining room. I put on the lights and then Angela finished the decorating. She had already put decorations around the house and I then put lights in the porch. Later I fixed the flasher unit (although I've not yet tested it) and did some more reserach on a motor for the Moth; one that will fit under the cowl.</p>
        <p>Sunday 18th December</p>
        <p>I had a slightly extended walk to buy a paper this morning, needing to go to Hyde Square. While Angela was at church I re-installed the TC's flasher unit nd test it. Then I spent a lot of time trying to work out what components I need to make a semiconductor version. I put some components that I have on to a breadboard, but it only flashed an LED once! We then spoke to Victoria (in Missouri) and to Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 19th December</p>
        <p>Following Angela's walk to Steyning we went over to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and filling his pill box. I then spent most of the afternoon experimenting with components to make a flasher unit. But I only managed to get an LED to flash once!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 20th December</p>
        <p>I spent the morning trying to get a flasher unit working using a 555 timer and other components that I had. But it did not flash! After lunch we went to Worthing hospital for Angela's appointment at ENT. I dropped her off and went to Maplins to buy the bits I needed for the flasher unit</p>
        <p>Wednesday 21st December</p>
        <p>This morning we drove down to Shoreham and caught the 700 bus to Littlehampton. After coffee we went into the branch of Kent Reliance to set up two regular savings accounts. As usual, they were very efficient. Afterwards we went for lunch in the Fish Factory before catching the bus back to Shoreham. Lunch was good and we were home just before four. I then found that Maplins had sold me the wrong capacitors and one wrong resistor!</p>
        <p>Thursday 22nd December</p>
        <p>Our usual shopping day, but the Thursday before Christmas. So it was very busy. We went off early to M&amp;S and then on to Dad's before going to Sainsbury. He decided not to come with us. After lunch, while Angela went to Philip's and Bay's, I re-made the flasher circuit using the new 555 timer and combining capacitors and resistors to give the required values. But the output turns on and stays on! Angela's cold was bad today.</p>
        <p>Friday 23rd December</p>
        <p>Angela started by walking down to Steyning to collect the turkey and a few other things. We then spent some of the day just tidying the house in preparation for our visitors. Even though it is not quite the end of the week, I did the weekly accounts. Then I replaced some of the components on my flasher circuit and it worked. Paul et al's plane was due to land at six o'clock, but it was delayed, with an estimated landing time of eight o'clock! When I got to Gatwick I found that two of the three short-term car parks were closed (for redevelopment) and so I had to go out and back in! When I got to the arrivals area the screen said that their luggage was in the baggage hall. They were not too long, but we missed the half-hour parking time and so it cost &#163;7! However, we were home by about 9:30.</p>
        <p>Saturday 24th December</p>
        <p>Christmas Eve, and a busy day. After breakfast for five Rowan made decorations and played games. We had an early lunch since Krista had bought tickets to see 'Kipper's Snowy Day' at the Conaught theatre in Worthing. So I took them into Worthing after lunch and, since the show was only 50 minutes long, parked by 'Comet', went to Maplins, bought a newspaper and sat in a coffee shop until it was time for them to come out. We then all walked back to the car and were home by 3:30. After dinner Krista and Paul were collected by some friends from Henfield and taken off to Storrington to meet up with some other friends (a repeat of their outing last Christmas Eve).</p>
        <p>Sunday 25th December</p>
        <p>Christmas Day! Just before 11 o'clock I went to collect Dad and bring him here for the day. But when we returned, Bay was still not ready, so I collected her at about 12:15. Lunch was not the best we have layed on, but afterwards we opened presents and then spoke with Victoria et al just after four. After some tea I took them both home (as Rowan went off to bed) and we watched the Dr Who 'special' before going to bed ourselves.</p>
        <p>Monday 26th December</p>
        <p>Boxing Day! Almost a repeat of yesterday. Just no presents and cold meats for lunch. I collected Dad and Bay during the morning (well it was 12:15 by the time Bay was ready) and after lunch Paul et al went for a walk up to the farm. We then had a short Facetime call with Alan and Chris before tea. I took them home immediately after tea, without giving them a chance to sit down!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 27th December</p>
        <p>After a latish breakfast we spent the rest of the morning doing a jigsaw puzzle; an old, relatively small, wooden one of a view across the Thames in London, where every piece was a different shape! Rowan was very good at spotting shapes, although found matchng pieces via the picture more difficult. It was a fine, sunny day, so after lunch we all walked down to Steyning to do a little shopping. We had an early dinner and apparently it was my turn to read bedtime stories and sit with Rowan until she went to sleep. Luckily that did not take long. The four of us then 'played' Krista's new game based on Sherlock Holmes cases. We all played as one team, but were not very good.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 28th December</p>
        <p>After breakfast Rowan did some painting and then Paul et al decided to go early to the airport so as to have lunch there before they flew. So I took them to Gatwick, arriving at 11:35. Their plane taxied out on time, but then they spent 40 minutes on the tarmac. They got home at 7:20. After lunch I tried to nail back the fence panels at the front, but really need to get ten new panels. We finished off the turkey in a pie!</p>
        <p>Thursday 29th December</p>
        <p>We went straight to Holmebush this morning to do the weekly shop. Luckily no one wanted very much this week so we were at Dad's by 12:15, just before Alan and Chris arrived. They went off to the Toby Carvery with Dad as we came home. After lunch I sorted out the payment into Juniper's account, mailed Professor Gao about hotel options and renewed our energy tariff while Angela delivered the shopping to Philip and Bay. I then started researching sofas.</p>
        <p>Friday 30th December</p>
        <p>Angela started by walking down to Steyning to go to the bank and the supermarket. When she got home we drove to Hove, originally to visit Harveys and Furniture Village to look at sofas, but found that there were two other sofa shops in the same small area. They all offerred us coffee, but most of their sofas were far too big for us. On the way home we stopped at Sainsbury's to get Philips cereal drinks. During and after a late lunch we watched a film! I then worked on the MG's flasher unit design. Later in the evening we looked at other sofa shops online and decided to go to Brighton tomorrow to visit Multiyork.</p>
        <p>Saturday 31st December</p>
        <p>Since it was foggy this morning we decided to catch the number 2 bus to Shoreham and then the 700 to Brighton. We bought a new sofa (slightly larger than we had planned) and then I bought a new coat. We got to the bus stop just in time to catch a 700 and then, as we arrived in Shoreham, a number 2 pulled out behind us; perfect timing. After a late lunch I checked the payment to Juniper's account and some other finances and then did the weekly accounts. I also updated the IET forthcoming events slide and started trying to correct some faults in a couple of other slides.</p>
