        <p>Tuesday 1st November</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning while I dealt with email. Then I took the MG out of the garage, went to Beeding to get some petrol and drove to Patching to meet Simon for lunch. The round trip drive was a total of 27 miles. When I got home, at about 2:30, Angela was working in the garden. Later I started compiling the trip site for our last visit to California.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 2nd November</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day 'playing' with a new linux OS (elementary). I managed to get an image on to a usb drive and boot from it. However, before installing it I had to make room by reducing the existing linux mint partition. I had to run Gparted from the usb drive so that the partition was not in use, but the screen went blank part way through and mint would then not load! So I tried using Gparted from a mint CD, but that froze! Better was Dad's appointment at Dematology at Southlands. We were early and finished before the time of the appointment. Angela went to Steyning in the morning and to table tennis in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Thursday 3rd November</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went to Steyning and to the health centre to get new parts for her hearing aids. Then we went to Dad's on our way to do the weekly shop. After lunch, between Angela taking Philip's and Bay's shopping to them, we took Sam to the cattery in Small Dole. We also put out our clothes for packing. While Angela was out I shrank the existing Mint partition on the laptop and installed the elementray OS in the space created. I now need to make a permanent mount of the data partition.</p>
        <p>Friday 4th November</p>
        <p>We left home at ten to nine this morning and drove to Gatwick. We checked our bags and went through security with enough time for a coffee before the gate was announced. Unfortunatley the plane was then delayed by 20 minutes due to a broken luggage net bolt in the hold. However, we got to Schiphol, had a sandwich and cought a train to Rotterdam just after 3pm. Krista met us at Capelsebrug and we were at their house (barn) just after four. Paul then got home half an hour later.</p>
        <p>Saturday 5th November</p>
        <p>We got up late after a fairly restless night. After a late breakfast we went for a walk, mainly in the sunshine and before the sky went grey. Greet and Wim were ther when we got back, working on the shed roof. So we moved some of the roofing sheets from the front and helped put some on the roof. They left after lunch. So Paul, Angela and Rowan cleared leaves while I tried tuning their guitar. Then we played games with Rowan.</p>
        <p>Sunday 6th November</p>
        <p>A lazy day after a night disturbed by heavy rain falling on the tin roof of the barn. We got up latish (woken by Rowan again) and had a shower. Paul cooked pancakes for breakfast and then we passed the morning dodging the showers, just looking at what Paul had to do outside. We then went out for lunch in Bergambacht, which was good, and played a game when we got back, before speaking with Austin. A snack for tea and the day was over.</p>
        <p>Monday 7th November</p>
        <p>We left Paul's at 10:30 this morning. He drove us to Capelsebrug Metro station, so we went to Rotterdam and caught the fast train to Schiphol. We arrived at midday, but it was one o'clock before we were checked in and got through security. We arrived home at 4:30.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 8th November</p>
        <p>After walking to Steyning to buy milk and get cash we went to the cattery at Small Dole to collect Sam. Then Angela went to see Mel and Val and I went over to see Dad. He had just returned from his appointment with the nurse for the start of his annual checkup. I made him a consolodated list, in chronological order, of his various appointments. After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting at Field Place. It was about the Volke's Electric Railway. After a short spell at home I drove to Crawley for the IET Sussex LN AGM and a talk on optical atomic clocks. The AGM was a bit of a farse, but the talk was excellent (and very technical).</p>
        <p>Wednesday 9th November</p>
        <p>This morning I set off in the TC to get some petrol at Beeding and then went on to Broadbridge Heath to meet up with the rest of the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee and a chat we started our drive to Furnace Green, via a convoluted, but interesting, route. I followed Brian and his 'lady friend'. They went wrong three times, the first after one and a half miles! The Parrot at Furnace Green was very good and after lunch I took a more direct route home, arriving at 3:15. I had done a total of 76 miles. When I got home Angela was at table tennis.</p>
        <p>Thursday 10th November</p>
        <p>We were a little earlier this week and so we did the M&amp;S shopping before we stopped for coffee. That meant that we were home by 12:30. So Angela managed to get back from Bay's in time for me to go to Angmering to set up a stand at their careers fair. We set up from 3:30 and it started at 4:30, finishing just before 7:30. It was a good and well organised event.</p>
        <p>Friday 11th November</p>
        <p>After Angela went down to Steyning we set off to Shoreham to catch the bus to Brighton. Unfortunately, when we got to Shoreham I found that I had forgotten my wallet! Angela waited in Shoreham while I came home for the wallet. Consequently I was half an hour late meeting Nikki Mason from Brighton University, but I did phone to tell her. After a chat over a cup of coffee I met up with Angela for lunch. We then did some shopping and got home at about 4:30. Later I set up an email and a web site for IET Sussex and updated the list of school activities.</p>
        <p>Saturday 12th November</p>
        <p>This morning we started by going to the health centre for our flu jabs. Angela went off first so as to drop off her cakes and puddings at the church hall and then, after we had both had our jabs, we returned there to help with the Christmas Fair. Angela helped make lunches and I sold tickets for the lunches. Consequently I didn't get a chance to really look around the rest of the stalls. I came home first, after we had our lunch, arriving at about 3:30. Angela got home about five. While waiting for her I updated the IET school events web page and sent the link to Hamish, Jenny, Adrian, Bruce and Manya.</p>
        <p>Sunday 13th November</p>
        <p>While I went to Beeding to buy a newspaper, Angela took Philip to church. I then did the weekly accounts (for the past two weeks) and re-wired Dad's alarm clock. I also started experimenting again with mounting my data partition under Elementary OS. After lunch I cleaned the TC and then we spoke with Paul and Rowan and then Victoria and Austin (and was watched by Juniper).</p>
        <p>Monday 14th November</p>
        <p>I started the day by going over to Dad's, to turn over his bed clothes and fill his pill box. I also showed him photos of Paul's barn and took his repeat prescription to the surgery. Meanwhile, Angela went down to the church to help with the lunch club. After lunch we took the highchair and Bay's old 'trolley' to a charity shop and called on her to glue her kitchen stool and look at her electric fire, which she said was not working properly. Later I went to the WSMGOC meeting, with a talk on the Wey and Arun Canal Trust. The speaker also showed part of documentary he is making about postcard links to the navigation. He was driving a cream TC that he has owned for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 15th November</p>
        <p>The day started by taking the Panda to Hassocks to have the 'rattle' fixed. It did not return! But I had a loan car. Most of the rest of the day was spent on either IET related things or trying to get the new Linux system working (although I failed). However, later I went to Falmer for an IET talk on the integration of renewable energy generation.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 16th November</p>
        <p>There was nothing organised today apart from Angela's table tennis after lunch and an expectation that I would need to collect the Panda from the garage in Hassocks. Angela went to her table tennis, but the car will not be ready until tomorrow! So I sorted out the link to the data partition on my new elementary OS. I also made two more of the canbane wires for the Moth, after quite a long time not doing anything on it.</p>
        <p>Thursday 17th November</p>
        <p>We started a little earlier this morning on our weekly shop, since I wanted to collect the Panda when it is ready. However, although we got to Holmebush early, we spent quite a lot of time in Next and M&amp;S prior to shopping for food. After a late lunch, the Panda was still not ready, so we took Bay's shopping to her. When we got home I had a call from the garage and so drove over to Hassocks and swapped the loan Panda for our, rattleless Panda. Meanwhile, Angela took Philip his shopping.</p>
        <p>Friday 18th November</p>
        <p>A noticable drop in temperature today. Not a day for venturing outside, although later it did brighten up. So this morning, while Angela went to the hygenist, I worked on the canbane wires for the Moth. After lunch Angela cooked a Christmas cake plus some other cakes and a steamed pudding. I plucked up courage while the sun was shining and cleaned out the gutters! I then finished bending the six wires for the canbane, although I haven't worked out how to fix them together.</p>
        <p>Saturday 19th November</p>
        <p>Today was Dad's 93rd birthday. On our way over to his house we called into M&amp;S to change my T-shirts for a smaller size. The only spaces in the carpark were those left by those leaving! Nevertheless we got to Dad's just before midday. He had a lot of birthday cards, including pictures from Rowan. We then went to the carvery at Lyons Farm and had a good lunch. Then we went back to Dad's for a cup of tea and piece of his birthday cake.</p>
        <p>Sunday 20th November</p>
        <p>I went down for a newspaper while Angela took Philip to church. I then soldered together the three wires on one side of the Moth's canbane. I got two of the three wires on the other side soldered and then my pencil torch stopped working. So we had lunch. Afterwards I tried cleaning the pencil torch by removing the small disc pressure regulator. But it 'pinged' away somewhere! So I soldered the last joint with the blowtorch. I then cut the brass tubes and soldered the two sides together. Later we went over to Dad's to see Alan and Chris. They had taken Dad to the same carvery that we had taken him to the day before. Unfortunately the off that the waiter told us about was not available on Sundays. When we got home we spoke to Rowan and then to Austin.</p>
        <p>Monday 21st November</p>
        <p>Terry from next door called just as I was leaving to go to Dad's. Terry brought their door key so that we could go in a feed their cat (Lilly) while they are away. At Dad's I collected his pills from the chemist, helped him change his bed and put on his washing. Then I filled his pill box and had a cup of coffee with him. I was home before lunch, after which Angela went to her WI AGM. I did more research on broadband/phone contracts, then found that plusnet (and John Lewis who use plusnet) both had very bad reviews. There seem to have been many problems switching, as well as poor performance. Although TalkTalk have just as bad reviews, I think I will just pay the extra and stay with them. At least nothing will need to be changed or set up and the performance is good enough (with a better download speed than plusnet were promising). I also cut holes in one side of the Moth's fuselage for binding the canbane wires to the structure. Then we fedd Lilly before dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 22nd November</p>
        <p>So today I paid for 18 months of telephone line rental (from 27th December) with TalkTalk so as to get a 15% discount and avoid any disruption to our internet service or loss of performance. Then I continued to cut slots in the Moth's fuselage frame so as to bind the canbane wires in place. I also looked at photos of the Moth that I am copying so as to work out where the bracing wires are attached. Angela had gone out to catch the bus to Storrington so as to pay in her WI cash. Once the bread had finished cooking I walked to Beeding to have a haircut, passing Angela just around the corner on her way home. Unfortunately, on my way home, whilst walking through the field, there was a heavy shower and I got drenched. After lunch I went to Dad's and walked with him to the surgery to see the nurse about the results of his annual review. He is quite fit.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 23rd November</p>
        <p>I spent a good part of the day working on the Moth. I bound the canbane wires to the fuselage, made the bracing wires, bound those in place, soldered the tops of the bracing wires to the canbane wires and put CA on the bindings. I also checked the tyre pressures on both cars, increasing those on the Panda for a heavy load. Meanwhile Angela did some cleaning and went to table tennis. This evening she has gone round to Bay's to 'rescue' her after she went to sleep holding a mug of coffee!</p>
        <p>Thursday 24th November</p>
        <p>Thanksgiving! But for us it was weekly shop day, as usual. We managed to start a little earlier than usual and so did the M&amp;S shopping before stopping for coffee. After lunch Angela took Philip and Bay their shopping and I trimmed the bindings of the canbane wires on the Moth. I also added alittle about me to my presentation on process automation.</p>
        <p>Friday 25th November</p>
        <p>'Black Friday'! Bt we let the tepations pass. Angela spent most of the morning in the kitchen, with me helping where I could, preparing food for the weekend. I did manage to do just a little on the Moth, but Kate and Dick arrived at about 1:15. A drink of fizz and dinner therefore took us until nearly four o'clock and so the whole afternoon and evening was spent eating and drinking.</p>
        <p>Saturday 26th November</p>
        <p>Following a late breakfast (Kate &amp; Dick are not early risers) we went off to Wakehurst Place. We started with coffee, walked around part of the garden, had lunch and then toured some of the rest. We got home in time to have dinner and then walk down to the Methodist church for a 60's evening.</p>
        <p>Sunday 27th November</p>
        <p>Another late breakfast. Then Kate and Dick set off home. After lunch and registering 15 A-level students for the space robotics talk we walked down to Steyning, bought a newspaper and went to a concert at the Steyning Centre. We got home at 5:15 and then spoke with Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 28th November</p>
        <p>This morning Angela walked down to Steyning while I got the TC out of the garage. We then drove it over the Bostal to Dad's. We turned over his bed clothes and filled his pill box while he made some coffee. We got home at about 1:15 and I made lunch. Afterwards we ordered eleven bowls of hyacinths, which are Bay's Christmas presents to a variety of people. Then I did the weekly accounts and emailed various members of the IET committee while Angela updated her WI programme document for next year. She started cooking while I modified the layout of her document to fit the paper and added a little to the Moth's build web page.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 29th November</p>
        <p>This morning Angela caught the bus to Worthing, mainly to get a 'director's chair' for Bay. The shop said they had one, which they did, but it was damaged. So they have kept one at their Brighton store if we want to go there (which we might on Friday). Meanwhile I made two of the three canbane struts on one side of the Moth. Later in the afternoon I took Dad to Southlands. His appointment was at 4:15, but they were running an hour late! He had a part of his right ear removed and we were back at his house at about 6:30.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 30th November</p>
        <p>Today I managed to finish one side of the Moth's canbane, by completing the ply strips and gluing them to the wire frame. Now I need to repeat the process on the other side. Angela went to table tennis after lunch. I also removed bank related security data from the computers and added a little more to the process automation presentation.</p>
