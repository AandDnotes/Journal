        <p>Sunday 1st May</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I spent quite a long time completing a Brighton University survey about their future plans. I also started making the second rudder bar for the Moth. After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. Later we spoke to both Victoria and Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 2nd May</p>
        <p>A bank holiday. We started by going to the church hall, where Angela worked in the kitchen again and I sold lunch tickets. After a late lunch I collected Bay and took her to the church to see the flowers and have a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 3rd May</p>
        <p>We woke late this morning. After breakfast Angela did two sets of washing (hanging out one) and then walked down to Steyning, while I hung out the second set and then started looking at the front hubs on the MG. I jacked up one wheel and removed the split pin on the stub axle so as to find out what socket will fit it. After lunch I modified the IET slideshow and then made an adaption to my hub puller in the hope that it will pull off the hubs. Before going to the IET talk in Crawley I ordered a set of Whitworth sockets and a compression tested. I also ordered a new bolt and 'wing nut' for the motor mower. To my surprise I ended up convening the talk!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 4th May</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning to have her hair cut and buy some food, I loaded the car with stuff for the tip. I took old oil, the old printer, batteries, light bulbs and an awful lot of wood from the garden. On the way to the tip I called in to Halfords to get a new set of feeler guages and some split pins. After lunch Angela worked in the garden while I warmed up the MG and re-adjusted the tappets. I also checked/adjusted the spark plugs and the points. Afterwards it started on the handle on the first real pull. I left the car in the middle of the garage so that I can access all the wheels. Before dinner I downloaded the registration list for last night's talk and scanned in the attendance list, sending it to Julie at the IET and sending both to Mike Underhill. After dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Brooklyn'. We enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>Thursday 5th May</p>
        <p>Shopping day. Actually we were able to finish and get home at a reasonable time. Even so, it was three o'clock before I started on the MG. While Angela went to Philip's and Bay's I took off the near-side front hub off. I was surprised that I could pull off the hub by hand. I found that the washers were not as I had seen them described, but I greased the brearings (at least pushed some grease into the outer bearing) and re-assembled it.</p>
        <p>Friday 6th May</p>
        <p>In spite of it being a hot, sunny day, it was a day of failures! This morning I tried to remove the off-side front hub on the TC. However, whereas the N/S hub came off with just a small tap, the retaining nut of the O/S one came off very easily, but I could not move the hub. And my adapted hub puller was not up to the job. Neil does not have one, so I've ordered one. Tomorrow I will put the retaining nut back. So I looked at the horn. The coil seems to be OK, but I could not get the horn apart. So I put it back together! Later I installed XQuarz (X11) and Inkscape on the Macbook.</p>
        <p>Saturday 7th May</p>
        <p>A slightly more successful day today. After our traditional walk to the Beeding newsagents I did the weekly and monthly accounts. During the latter the iMac froze and so I had to force it to shutdown, loosing my work. I must look at adding more memory. After a lunch sitting in the garden I finished the monthly accounts and then worked on the TC. I replaced the retaining nut on the O/S front hub, tightening it to about 80ft-lb, and then gave ten pumps of grease to each of the rear wheel bearings. So the car is now usable for Monday's 'fish &amp; chip supper' run. After dinner we went to a Music Society concert at the Steyning Centre, having a quick look at the outside of a bungalow that is for sale on the way. The performers were a soprano, a pianist and a clarinetist, all relatively local. The latter seemed to be more comedian than musician.</p>
        <p>Sunday 8th May</p>
        <p>In spite of spending a lot of the day making a drawing of the TC's front hub, we managed to do quite a lot. We started by having a talk with Rowan on her birthday before going for a walking to the newsagents at Beeding. Angela then went on to church. After lunch Angela cut the back grass and I cut the front. Then we spoke to Victoria and, before a late dinner, booked Sam into the cattery and booked flights to Amsterdam in the middle of July so as to visit Paul et al. </p>
        <p>Monday 9th May</p>
        <p>I'm writing this the next day and already having difficulty remembering what we did! I told Paul about our arrangements to visit them in July and booked car parking at Gatwick. After lunch, while it was spitting with rain, we scattered lawn feed on the back grass, since the forecast was for rain. In the early evening we took the MG to Washing to meet up with other members of the WSMGOC. We then went on a run, mainly along country lanes, ending at the rugby club for fish &amp; chips. It was spitting with rain a lot of the way and we (I) took a wrong turn near the end and so took a slightly longer route. The tappets sounded very noisy, so I must look at them again before Wednesday's run with the Sussex Wanderers. We got home at about 10:30. The rain had stopped and the headlights worked quite well, even though we took a mainly 'lit' route home.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 10th May</p>
        <p>This morning I did an experiment with the TC so as to determine what type of camshaft was fitted. It turned out to be the original type, that needs a 19 thou gap between the rockers and the valve stems. After lunch I walked to Steyning, carrying Angela's WI bag part of the way. She went to a committee meeting and I went to Hamilton Graham's to arrange to view a house that we thought might be a candiate for 'downsizing'. However, an offer had been made on it this morning! When I got home I warmed up the MG and re-adjusted the tappets. I decided to leave them at 19 thou even though they are bit noisey. At least I know that is the correct clearance, even if there is a bit of dimpling. After that I washed the Panda and put them both in the garage.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 11th May</p>
        <p>Austin's birthday. Angela went off walking, in the rain, and I set off in the MG for Billy's, just north of Billingshurst, to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee we set off, down many small lanes, to Warnham, near Horsham, for lunch. Overall I did 65 miles. Although it was raining on the way to Billy's, I had the roof down for the main run (and only got a little wet) and on the way home. Unfortunately the car got quite dirty. Angela's walking group consisted of ony two! They caught the bus to Henfield and walked back, going for coffee at the other walker's house. Angela got home just gefore one and I got home at 3:30.</p>
        <p>Thursday 12th May</p>
        <p>We managed to do the weekly shop early today so that Angela got to Bay's in time to take her a garden centre. Meanwhile I investigated the wiring for the indicator switch and flasher unit and then started cleaning the car. I can't understand it, but I wiped over the paintwork and then started under the wings and the chassis on the near side.</p>
        <p>Friday 13th May</p>
        <p>Yesterday I forgot to take two items for Dad out of other bags. So this morning, after Angela had been down to Steyning, we took them over to him. I also topped up his pill box (I can't go over on Monday) and I trimmed his box hedge while Angela pulled up weeds. After lunch Angela went to a 'messy church' session and I finished cleaning the mud off the MG. I also fixed the indicators. The flasher unit was poorly made and the heating wire had become disconnected. In the evening I sent comments on the Sussex LN budget spreadsheet as requested by the IET.</p>
        <p>Saturday 14th May</p>
        <p>A tiring day for both of us. I was collected at 7:45 (about an hour earlier than necessary) by George and taken to Crawley. After a long coffee break we unloaded our IET stuff into a gazebo in preparation for the Crawley STEMfest mini big bang event. It was a slow start from 10:00 (and quite cold), but then the sun came out and so did the people. We were rushed off our feet and could only finish our lunch (kindly provided by Bernadette) after we had finished at three o'oclock. Meanwhile, Angela drove to Hinton Abner (about one and a half hours drive) to meet Carol and June. George dropped me off at about 4:30 and Angela got home at about 6:30. I had developed a cold overnight and by the time I got home I had little in the way of a voice.</p>
        <p>Sunday 15th May</p>
        <p>A quieter day, with both of us feeling under the weather. Angela walked to the Beeding newsagents only to find that they had run out of Telegraphs. So I walked with her to Steyning and brought back a paper. I then finished an article for Main Gear. After lunch I eventually went into the garage and removed the O/S front hub, even thought my new hub puller was not big enough. It has a cupped washer!. The stub axle looked fine, so I cleaned it, pumped in some grease and put it back. Now just the drum to replace. We then spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 16th May</p>
        <p>We both have colds, neither of us slept well, we have both had a busy day and we are both exhausted. This morning I went over to George's and we then went on to Hamish's and on to the Ormiston Six Villages Academy to run a Control Technologies workshop. The times had got confused and we were an hour early! Then we had 12 'special needs' children. It started well but fell apart as we got further into the workshop. Meanwhile, Angela had a WI meeting. I got home just after five and she arrived a few minutes later. She then spent most of the rest of the afternoon and evening sorting out the money from the meeting.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 17th May</p>
        <p>We got up late, both still feeling poorly. I drove Angela into Steyning so as to pay in her WI cash and then went over to Dad's. I helped him change his bed and put on his washing. Before and after lunch, and a bit of a snooze, I copied the CoCo CD and installed the software on Windows 10 and then put the brake drum and O/S wheel back on the TC, before amending my text for the IET Members News and sending it off. Then I went to Falmer to an IET talk on railway signalling.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 18th May</p>
        <p>Today was intended to be a modelling day, but it didn't happen. I had a reply from the TC expert at the Octagon Club about my front hubs. Having looked at them and taken some photos it is clear that they have been put on the wrong sides and the steering stop bolt left off! So I asked more questions about swapping them over. I also checked that the IET Sussex LN committee had been informed about the change of date and that the room booking at the Hawth had been changed. Since Angela was going out to collect charity envelopes during the early evening, we had our main meal at lunch time. We then had a long rest! I made diagrams of the flasher wiring and e-mailed people about IET Younger Members in the universities. I also noted the date that I did each of the service tasks on the TC.</p>
        <p>Thursday 19th May</p>
        <p>We had difficulty motivating ourselves this morning, shopping day, due to our colds. However, we got to Dad's, then on to M&amp;S (starting with coffee) and finally to Tesco. We were not too late home for lunch, after which Angela took shopping to Philip and to Bay and I ordered memory for the iMac and cut the grass, front and back. I finished just before she got back.</p>
        <p>Friday 20th May</p>
        <p>We both felt better this morning, but it did not last. I also heard again from the Octagon Club TC expert, who pointed out that the cotter pins look more like bolts! So he recommends a strip down and rebuild urgently. So I spent some of the morning researching details of the job. After lunch Angela went into the greenhouse to make hanging baskets while I brushed and washed the garage doors (and facia) in preparation for rubbing down and painting. The iMac memory that I ordered yesterday arrived today! So I replaced the existing two memory boards so that now we have 4GB, the same as the MacBook. The iMac is now noticably faster. I also asked my 'speakers' for their titles and synopsis and compiled a list of questions for the MG-TABC group.</p>
        <p>Saturday 21st May</p>
        <p>We were not up early this morning and decided to walk down to Beeding for a paper before having a shower. So there was really only just time to post my questions to the MG-TABC group before we went out and to try to sort out an incorrect e-mail address with Santander before lunch. Our colds are a little easier, but Angela is still taking the paracetamol. After lunch I did the weekly accounts and downloaded information about dividends from Equinity, read replies from the MG-TABC group, looked up some details about reaming and reamers and started making the forward rudder bar for the Moth, the first work I have done on it for several weeks! Meanwhile Angela continued putting together hanging baskets in the greenhouse.</p>
        <p>Sunday 22nd May</p>
        <p>I'm writing this entry on Monday, having forgotten to write it on Sunday night. Angela ferried people to/from church, while I walked to the newsagents. I then spent a lot of the day making parts of the rudder foot pedals and linking rods for the Moth. I also posted another question on the mg-tabc group forum about crack testing.</p>
        <p>Monday 23rd May</p>
        <p>It has been a busy day, but I have just found that I did not update my journal yesterday! However, this morning, after showering, we went to Brighton so that I could show STEM Sussex my 'proof of identity' documents so as to renew my DBS certificate. We tried to come back along the A270, but the roads have changed (some are now one-way, the other way) and so it took a long time to get to Homebase, which did not have any bird tables. So we went to Sainsbury's for a new watch strap for Angela (from Timpsons), coffee and some vegetables. We also bought two T-shirts for Austin! We then went to the Maybury garden centre, where we found a suitable bird table for Bay's birthday. From there we went on to Dad's to fill his pill box and turn his bed clothes. By this time his lunch was ready, so we came home for a late lunch. After that Angela worked in the garden while I dug rot out of the garage doors and rubbed them down, prior to paiting. I also e-mailed people about parts for the TC's steering knuckles.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 24th May</p>
        <p>A less busy day. We were not up early, but I spent part of the morning adding beading to one of the garage doors and priming bits of bare wood. Later in the day I put gloss (one coat) on the planks above the door and on the frame. In between I put some wax on the MG. Apart from going down to Steyning, Angela spent most of the time in the garden.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 25th May</p>
        <p>While Angela took the car (and some of her WI friends) to Pulborough to go walking, I painted the garage doors. It took less time and less paint than I expected, so I was finished by 12:30. After lunch Angela worked in the front garden and I did a little more modelling. I finished making the pieces for one side of the rudder bar. But just before I was going to solder them, Bay phoned. She had pushed a shelf under sink off its pins. So we went round and put it all back for her. So dinner was a little late!</p>
        <p>Thursday 26th May</p>
        <p>Angela had a voucher for Sainsbury's, so we took Dad to M&amp;S for coffee and then shopping, before we bought the rest of his food in Tesco. After taking him home we went to Sainsbury's to do the rest. Of course, this meant that we had our lunch quite late. While Angela went to Philip's and to Bay's I cut the front grass and half the rear grass. Then, after an early dinner, I went to a Steyning Festival talk on teh International Space Station and future space exploration options. The speaker was a journalist and author and talked well about the ISS and his view on what should/could be done in the future. Alan phoned to say he wanted to invite Dad for the long weekend. But he phoned back to say that Dad did not want to go, so they would visit him.</p>
        <p>Friday 27th May</p>
        <p>We started by walking down to Steyning, Anglea to shop and go to the bank and library, and me to try to find a cap in one of the charity shops. The cap is for my 'vintage' dress for tomorrow's fair. But no luck. However, I then went over to Dad's and borrow one (that he had not used). After an early lunch I worked on the MG. I tightened the bardge-bar bolts (and one of the bolts on the near side damper) and adjusted the tappets (again). Then I finished cutting the rear grass before having a shower and an early dinner. We then walked to the Grammar School to see a play (A Bedroom Farce, by Alan Ayckbourne). It was an amature production, but very good.</p>
        <p>Saturday 28th May</p>
        <p>The weather forcast, even on the local radio this morning, was for a dry day, but with the possibility of a shower later in the day. However, just before I was going to take the MG out of the garage it started raining. It stopped just before ten, so I drove it down to Fletchers Croft for the Vintage Fair, but after a while it started raining again, then poured, with thunder! The cafe ran out of bacon rolls, so I went to St Andrew's for the organ recital, after which the sun came out and it was a beautiful afternoon. Meanwhile, Angela went to the Beeding newsagents and later came down to see what was going on. I got home just before five, we had an early dinner and then walked down to the Steyning Centre to see The Pearl Fishers. They were fully booked! but added acouple of seats for us.</p>
        <p>Sunday 29th May</p>
        <p>A successful day. After buying a paper and doing the weekly accounts I put the front of the MG on axle stands, under the chassis this time. This allowed the front axle to drop in case I needed to remove it. After lunch I removed the nearside hub, unbolted the backplate (and steering links) and hung the backplate from the brake pipe bracket. Then I removed the cotter pin, using a large G-clamp, and tapped out the kingpin. The kingpin and bushes look in good condition, as does the thrust washer. The latter has a shim (spacer) beneath it and I could not measure any float/wear. I now hope that I can do the same on the other side and that I can swap the stub axles.</p>
        <p>Monday 30th May</p>
        <p>Bank holiday Monday! A productive day. This morning we went to Dad's to fill his pill box, change his bed and put on his washing. We also took down the net curtains in his bedroom and, while Angela washed them I cleaned the window frame and windows. The nets were dry before we left and so we hung them again. Also, Alan had fitted two new wooden panels to the shed (plus a patch on the roof), but had not painted them. So I found some fence paint in the shed at the bottom of the garden and painted the panels. After lunch I removed the offside hub, backplate and stub axle. then I ordered a crack test kit and new cotter pins, thrust washers and shims.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 31st May</p>
        <p>The day started quietly. Angela walked to Steyning while I renewed the TC's insurance and filled out a form to extract the cash from an NS&amp;I index linked bond when it matures. Angela then completed her's. After lunch I soldered together the the brass and steel parts that make up one side of the rudder pedals on the Moth. Then I worked on my 'notebook' web pages. We had eaten our main meal at lunchtime because we were both going to a talk at the Methodist church on the sun. However, before we had tea the 'call button' people phoned. Bay had a power cut. So we went round, expecting it to be just her house, but it was a wider power cut. We rushed off, had tea and Angela went off to the church to help set up the refreshments. I followed after phoning Dad and Bay - still no power! After a very good talk I walked home and phone Bay - still no power - 9:45 by this time. So I went round again. The recorded message said the power should be back by 11:30. So I helped her get to bed, by candle light. Then blew out the candles and left her at 10:30.</p>
