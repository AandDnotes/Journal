        <p>Tuesday 1st March</p>
        <p>An early start. Up at six and out by ten past seven. Arrived at Brambletye in East Grinstead at 8:20, before Hamish, George and Jennie arrived. We then ran two workshops, leaving at about five o'clock. So I went directly to Crawley to the IET talk at the Hawth. It was on home 3D printing. I got home at about ten past nine. Meanwhile Angela spent the day at home.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 2nd March</p>
        <p>I started by going over to Dad's, mainly to change the dressings on his hands and face. I also showed him photos from our trip to Rotterdam. In the afternoon, after an abortive walk to the hairdressers (they were closed) I scanned the attendance sheets from yesterday's IET talk and sent them to Julie Hudson. I also updated the slideshow for the next talk.</p>
        <p>Thursday 3rd March</p>
        <p>Today I was up at 5:30 and we left at 6:35, arriving at George's at 6:55. Angela then went off to do the weekly shop while George and I went on to pick up Hamish. We were at Butlins at Bognor by 7:40, much earlier than we needed to be! However, we had a good day at the STEMfest, being joined by Jenny and Adrian. George got me back home just before 4:30.</p>
        <p>Friday 4th March</p>
        <p>I managed to get a haircut this morning and then went round to Bay's to fit a new amplifier to her TV and show her the photos from Paul's. Angela helped Sandy with flowers this morning and went out again after lunch. After a nice pizza I went to the SRFC meeting.</p>
        <p>Saturday 5th March</p>
        <p>We took a slight diversion on the way to the newsagents this morning, just along the river bank for a short distance. Then it was weekly and monthly accounts time. After lunch we went into Worthing. I bought a new pair of walking boots and Angela bought a new fleece. On the way home we stopped at Rogers Farm to have a cup of tea and buy some plants for hanging baskets.</p>
        <p>Sunday 6th March</p>
        <p>I walked to the newsagenets this morning while Angela walked to church. I managed to get a little done on the Tiger Moth today, but only to add pieces of hardwood to the main parts of the central frame. We spoke to Victoria, but Paul was home late and so we will speak to them tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Monday 7th March</p>
        <p>We went to Dad's this morning to fill his pill box, turn over his bed cloths and refresh his dressings. Before we went, Angela did two sets of washing, since it was a fine day. After lunch we both went into the garden, where I got the mower running (eventually) and cut all the grass, front and rear. We then spoke with Paul et al before dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 8th March</p>
        <p>An early collection this morning by Hamish and then off to Burgess Hill to a careers fair. The children did not arrive until about 9:15 and it finished early at 12:30. We then went to the Sportsman pub for lunch, getting home at about 2:30. I then e-mailed Gemma at the IET about the information for the award, completed rewiring Dad's vacuum cleaner and stuck Bay's watch strap. Then I did some research on XPAG engine numbers, trying to identify if the TC's engine has a different spec to the original. I e-mailed the Octagon Club to see if they can help.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 9th March</p>
        <p>Today was intended to be a day of modelling. To some extent it was, but progress was minimal. I spent a while trying to make the two sides of the centre frame match (the hardwood blocks did not align very well) and then cut out and bent the front aluminium bracket. Then I put new filters in Dad's vacumm cleaner and ended up vacuuming the hall, study, dining room and sitting room, just to test it! This afternoon, while Angela was at table tennis, I walked down to Bunces to get some M3 bolts and sme small countersunk screws. I need a threaded end (with two nuts) for the control rod that runs under the pilot's seats. I had several bolts that might be forced to screw into the brass tube, but no nuts. Unfortunately, 3mm bolts are a bit thin. So I tried soldering it in, to no avail, and then tried soldering a piece of 12swg rod into the tube. But the solder will not stick to the steel rod, in spite of cleaning it, applying flux and heating the rod with a blowlamp.</p>
        <p>Thursday 10th March</p>
        <p>Shopping day. While Angela and Dad went into Tesco, after doing the shopping in M&amp;S (and having coffee), I bought a pair of trousers in the M&amp;S sale. We were home by 1:30 and while Angela went to Philip's and Bay's I did a little more on the Tiger Moth. I continued researching silver soldering and decided to get some new solder and flux. So I continued making the parts for the control connections.</p>
        <p>Friday 11th March</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning making the joint for one of the joy sticks while Angela went to Steyning. After an early lunch we went to Worthing and parked near the station. Angela walked to Wilkingsons and I walked to the model shop. Unfortunately they had nothing that I wanted! Then we went to the church hall for a quiz night and fish &amp; chip supper. Our table came joint second.</p>
        <p>Saturday 12th March</p>
        <p>It was quite misty as we walked to the Beeding newsagents this morning, as it has been for the past couple of days. The rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts, including reconciling the entries against the statement. After lunch I did a little more to the centre frame of the Tiger Moth. However, Once I had joinrd the two sides with the aluminium brackets and got them square in one direction, I found that they were not verticle. I have not drilled the holes for the screws parallel to the sides! Now I either add a pice of ply across the bottom to pull the sides in or remove the hardwood blocks and replace them. After a relatively early dinner we went to the music society concert. It was given by the Shubert Ensemble and apart from the first (modern) piece it was very good.</p>
        <p>Sunday 13th March</p>
        <p>Before we got going today Dad phoned. His kettle would not work and he was using a saucepan instead. So I went to Sainsbury's and bought him a new one, putting shoes/boots and coffee bgs in the recycling bins, getting some cash and buying a paper. He liked his black kettle. On the way home I looked for small screws in B&amp;Q and bought a vice at Screwfix. My intent was to do some modelling, but I firstly tried out my Scratch/Arduino interface. I installed a new version of Scratch 2 Offline and then it would not recognise the extension blocks. Although they ran. And they are recognised by the online version of Scratch.</p>
        <p>Monday 14th March</p>
        <p>A busy day. It started with a call asking Angela to help with the whole of the lunch club, even though she was not on the rota. She went off and I went to the dentist for a check-up (and a filling). I then took the MG out to get some petrol at Beeding and on to Dad's, where I filled his pill box, changed his bed and put on his washing. I took my lunch with me so that I could go straight on to George's where he, Hamish and I went through the Engery Watch workshop. In the evening I went to the WSMGOC. WE could not get into the rugby club, so went to a pub, where I won the raffle.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 15th March</p>
        <p>All morning was spent making preparations for this evenings IET meeting (which I said that I would convene) and dealing with the notes from yesterday's meeting on Energy Watch. After lunch I did a little work on the Moth. Actually I only made new versions of what I have alread made badly. Then I went to Falmer to meet Maggie Boden and host the talk. Unfortunately there was a match at the Amex stadium and the e-mail that was sent to registrants about the change of venue had the wrong start time. However, it was a thought provoking talk; different to our usual events.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 16th March</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning sending the attendance sheets from last night's talk to Julie Hudson at the IET and a 'thank you' note to Maggie Boden. I also had a call from Hamish asking for an update. I also had an e-mail from Gemma Hadley at the IET with a logo, font and certificate in connection with the award. Later in the day I spoke with Michael Mooney to check that he would be available on April 14th to receive the award. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I worked on the Moth. Really only making new versions of pieces for the central frame.</p>
        <p>Thursday 17th March</p>
        <p>Before going shopping I replied to another e-mail from Graham Walker at the Octagon Club. We then went to Dad's and then Holmebush, starting with coffee. This afternoon, while Angela went to Philip's and Bay's, I ordered the IET Outstanding Contribution award trophy and sent the award certificate to the committee for comment. I then completed the bracket at the rear of the central frame (that holds the elevator linkages), but managed to get the holes for the transvers rod out of alignment! I might need to make another one.</p>
        <p>Friday 18th March</p>
        <p>The morning was spent vacuuming and preparing for our visitors. Angela went down to Steyning and did a lot of cooking. Kate and Dick arrived a few minutes before two o'clock. We then spent until 4:30 haveing lunch!. Before long it was afternoon tea time, then time for a bite of tea and a relatively early night, having made plans for the morning.</p>
        <p>Saturday 19th March</p>
        <p>Late (very late) breakfast and then we set off for Slindon, where we had a quick walk around the village and coffee in the shop. We then went off to Chichester, where we had lunch and then walked around the city walls.</p>
        <p>Sunday 20th March</p>
        <p>Another late breakfast. In fact it was nearly 10:30 before we finished. Then Kate and Dick left and we went over to Dad's. We filled his pill box, changed his bed and put on his washing. After lunch Angela went to Bay's to get Paul's birthday card, while I tried to find the rattle in the car, cleaned the door bell push button and did the weekly accounts. Then we spoke to Paul et al and then to Victoria and Austin.</p>
        <p>Monday 21st March</p>
        <p>A very early start. I got up at 6am and George called for me at seven. So we were at the careers fair at Moulescoomb by 7:40; the first there apart from the organisers. George dropped me home at 2:30 and Angela arrived home at about 4:30, after a call from Bay about collecting a prescription from Paydens after 6pm. So we walked down to the health centre and then on to Bay's and got home at about 7:10. So a late dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 22nd March</p>
        <p>A bad day for Brussels! I seemed to spend most of the morning reading e-mails and preparing for this evenings events sub-committee meeting. Angela went to Steyning and then, just before lunch I walked to Bunces to get some butane gas for my new pencil torch. After lunch I modified the rear bracket on the central frame, but one of the screws broke, leaving the thread in the wood! I will need to remove the piece of hardwood and fit a new piece. I also spoke to Jon opposite and then went to the IET meeting in Shoreham. We could have finished by 8:30, but it was 9:45 before we left Bernard's.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 23rd March</p>
        <p>This morning I took the MG for a run over to Dad's to meet his Nigel, his gardener. Dad seemed pleased with his work. Before lunch I tidied the documents from last night's IET events meeting and sent them to Hamish. After lunch, while Angela went to table tennis, I cut the grass, front and back. Luckily it was not too long and the mower started first time. I then removed the piece of hardwood with the broken screw and fitted a new one and experimented with adding another slide to the IET slideshow.</p>
        <p>Thursday 24th March</p>
        <p>Shopping day agian. We took Dad to M&amp;S and then to Tesco as usual. It was even busier than usual due to the approach of Easter. After lunch, while Angela took shopping to Bay and Philip, I completed Ben's passport application, submitted gas and electric meter readings, entered Dad's Mail numbers and worked on my model.</p>
        <p>Friday 25th March</p>
        <p>This morning I soldered together the steel rod and brass tubes that connect the two joysticks of the Moth. The silver solder seemed to work, although I used more gas trying to get the pencil torch lit! I then spent the rest of the morning making a second joystick connector, only to realise later that the one in the rear cockpit is longer than the one in the front cockpit! So I had to make another one. Since it was such a fine day, Angela persuaded me to go in the garden and cut out old wood from the lilac. I also cut through the ivy that is growing up the fir tree at the bottom of the garden.</p>
        <p>Saturday 26th March</p>
        <p>This morning we drove to the Southwater Country Park. Actually, we first went to Tesco at Broadbridge Heath to get some photos printed and fill the car with petrol. Unfortunately that branch of Tesco, in spite of being a large store, does not have a photo processing department, but I did remember to take the petrol can and so now have fuel for the mower. We started with coffee at the park before taking a stroll around the 'dinosaur' playground to see if it might be suitable for Austin. We think it is. We got back just in time for lunch. Then Angela went in the garden and I did the weekly accounts. Afterwards I did a little more to the components of the central frame. The plan seems to show the aileron lever in one position in one view and the slot through which it passes in a different position in another view! Also, it does not show how long to make the lever, but the position of the connecting wires on the wings plan seem to be level with the fuselage floor!</p>
        <p>Sunday 27th March</p>
        <p>We decided against buying a paper today, so while Angela went to church I worked on my model. However, my new pencil torch would not work. The valve will not let out any gas. So I e-mailed the supplier and used the blowtorch, which has a tendency to heat more than I want. However, I soldered the aileron control lever to the linking rod and made a new connecting wire between the joysticks. Then I added the cross braces and the strengthening pieces to the fuselage. We then spoke with Victoria before dinner.</p>
        <p>Monday 28th March</p>
        <p>Paul et al had their Easter family day yesterday and we had ours today. I went over to Dad's, filled his pill box, helped him turn his bed clothes over, brought him back and a little later collected Bay. We gave them lunch, helped them talk with Paul and Rowan, showed them photos, gave them tea and took them home. We had a reason to get Bay home by a specific time; her evening carer visit was due from about 7:45.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 29th March</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning dealing with e-mail, sending Julie at the IET questions about putting our schools programme list and details of our outstanding contribution award on the Sussex LN web page. I also had a phone call from CU Alloys saying that they would send me a replacement pencil torch. After lunch we went to the Guild Care charity warehouse and bought a second hand scooter for Austin, a toy for Juniper and a game. I will need to do substantial refurbishment of the scooter. We then went into Worthing, to the bank and some shops, stopping for tea in Waitrose and then at Boots and B&amp;Q at Lyons Farm. We tried to stop at the model shop, but their carpark was full.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 30th March</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day working on the parts for the central frame of the Moth. But I seem to have little to show for it! This morning Angela worked in the garden and after lunch went to table tennis. I fitted a galvanised bracket to the fence in the bottom corner and spent some time reading about UEFI. However, I'm little further forward in getting the laptop to start up with Refind. I also started compiling the list of jobs to do when servicing the TC.</p>
        <p>Thursday 31st March</p>
        <p>A usual Thursday. Dad's to make his shopping list; M&amp;S for coffee and food shopping; Tesco for more food shopping. After lunch Angela took Philip his shopping and then went around to Bay's. Meanwhile, I worked on the scooter. I could not get it all apart, so I cleaned it and painted the rusty chrome pieces with white Hammerite. I also ordered two litres of gear oil (EP140), since I could not find any locally.</p>
