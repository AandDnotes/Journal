        <p>Saturday 1st October</p>
        <p>Rather than walk to the Beeding newsagent we went over to Dad's and took him to Currys to buy a new TV. After going to Sainsbury's to get some bread, eggs and newspapers we took him home to set up his TV. Later in the afternoon we took Bay's small TV back to her and tried to find out why one of her smoke detectors repeatedly went off. I brought it home and will e-mail the supplier. Then I did the weekly and monthly accounts. I also completed the minutes of the IET committee meeting and sent them to Sathish.</p>
        <p>Sunday 2nd October</p>
        <p>While Angela took Philip to church this morning I walked to the Beeding newsagent. Then I replaced the motor mount and motor on the Cub. I also started trying to repair the cowl. After lunch I took the MG for a test run (of 29 miles). The new bushes made a noticable difference. Meanwhile, Angela washed the Panda. We were expecting paul et al after dinner, but they arrived while we were talking with Victoria! So we made them so scrambled egg and beans on toast and then had our dinner.</p>
        <p>Monday 3rd October</p>
        <p>This morning we all went off to Dad's, where we changed his bed, put on his washing and filled his pill box. We then went to west Worthing, to the 'pirate' playground. From there we walked back into Worthing and had lunch on the pier. It was then a long walk back to the car. We were home by about five thirty, very weary.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 4th October</p>
        <p>Angela and Krista walked down to Steyning to get things for a picnic, while Rowan and I played with her letters. We then made a picnic and set off for the Southwater Country Park and Dinosaur Island. After Rowan had a try on all the pieces of equipment we walked around the lake to the cafe and had our lunch. Then we walked back to the playground and let Rowan have another, long spell on the climbing frames and slides. When we got home we went in the garden and picked cooking apples. Rowan then helped Angela make an apple crumble.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 5th October</p>
        <p>A busy day. We started by taking Rowan to Henfield, to go to the bank, buy some food and visit the farm shop. Oh, and we stopped for coffee and ice cream! After lunch I took the control technology equipment back to STEM Sussex. Then later in the day, I went to Crawley for an IET talk.</p>
        <p>Thursday 6th October</p>
        <p>A long day, but an enjoyable one. I went with Angela to Dad's to help make his shopping list and then the three of us went to Shoreham station, where they dropped me before going shopping. I caught the (slightly late) train to Victoria, getting to Savoy Place and registering just in time to catch the final talk before lunch. I went to the following two and was just a little late meeting Hamish and Evana at Starbucks int he Strand for a talk about the role of the SLO. Hamish and I then went back to Savoy Place, where we met George and they were introduced to the Faraday Centre. We then registered for the Presidential Address. In the process I met Bob Matthams, who, it seems, is a good friend of Jeremy Watson. We also met up with John Haliday. After teh address John took us to the Sailing Association clubhouse at Limehouse Basin for fish and chips. It seems that his ulterior motive was to find out about crewing for other people. We did not really ahve enough time and so left part way through our meal so as to catch our trains. I got back to Shoreham just after 11 o'clock and Angela came to collect me.</p>
        <p>Friday 7th October</p>
        <p>We were still tired from yesterday, but Angela went off to Storrington to get WI bank statements and I tried to resolve why my schools web page no longer worked. After lunch we took Rowan to the park (and to Bay's) while Paul and Krista went shopping.</p>
        <p>Saturday 8th October</p>
        <p>A quieter day today. Paul et al went off to Kew Gardens to meet some friends and so were not back until six o'clock. We walked to Beeding to buy a paper and some milk, then I did the weekly accounts while Angela did her WI accounts. After lunch Angela went in the garden while I reworked the IET schools list and answered some other email.</p>
        <p>Sunday 9th October</p>
        <p>Another quiet day. I walked to Beeding while Angela went to church. When I got home I posted two blog posts on the IET Sussex LN page, one for the schools activities and one about the award. Then mailed Julie about creating a link to them. After lunch we did little except reading the paper before Paul and Krista went out. They have gone to a concert in Portsmouth, so we had dinner with Rowan and then put her to bed.</p>
        <p>Monday 10th October</p>
        <p>Paul et al left at about 10:15 this morning (and arrived home at about 9:20pm). We then went to Dad's to fill his pill box and turn over his bed clothes. After lunch Angela went in the garden and I downloaded photos and went through my slides for tomorrow's talks. After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Worthing Rugby Club. The talk was from the president of the MG Car Club and he talked about the history of MG and the MG cars that he has owned.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 11th October</p>
        <p>Mid morning I went to Steyning Grammar School to give three talks to firstly a group of year 10 pupils and then year 11 pupils. Each talk was 35 minutes long, but I didn't seem to hold their attention. Anglea went to a WI committee meeting in the afternoon and, after a late lunch, I potterred.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 12th October</p>
        <p>This morning I took the Panda to Hassocks to get a service and MoT. Of course, by the time I'd arrived the rattle had stopped! It was later than expected before it was ready to collect. They lent me a new Panda for the day. They also agreed to take the dashboard out to find the rattle under waranty. In between I completed fitting the cowl to the Cub and backed up a lot of photos. For some reason I could not get the laptop to connect to either of the Macs. So I used a memory stick.</p>
        <p>Thursday 13th October</p>
        <p>Shopping day. After lunch, while Angela went to Bay's, I cut the grass, front and back. After that, I put together the literature and torch kits that we need for tomorrow's STEM fair at Rudgewick.</p>
        <p>Friday 14th October</p>
        <p>George arrived at about ten o'clock and we set off for Rudgewick at a quarter past. Anglea had gone down to the church to help clean some parts of the new kitchen before George arrived. He and I got to Pennthorpe School just before eleven and set up our stand. We were given lunch and then to onslaught started. George spent quite some time judging projects, so I had to cope on my own. We finished at 3:30, feeling somewhat tired, packed up (I forgot to take down our posters) and got home just before five. Bernadette arrived to collect George half way through a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Saturday 15th October</p>
        <p>After a long walk to get a newspaper this morning I did the weekly accounts and created the links on the Sussex LN web page to the two blog pages. I also updated the pre-talk slides for Tuesday. Meanwhile, Angela had left early for a church 'thing'. And I read quite a lot of the paper.</p>
        <p>Sunday 16th October</p>
        <p>The newsagents at Beeding had papers today, so I didn't need to walk as far as I did yesterday. When I got back I checked over the MG, ready for Wednesday's run. Then I completed the record of our trip to Cornwall in June/July 2015 and created the link to it from our 'trips' page. I also moved the mouse traps from one end of the loft to the other. There are lots of mouse droppings under the insulation at the far end! After lunch we went to Bay's to collect her hearing aid batteries and test her smoke detector. It is still sounding without smoke, even after cleaning. When we got home we spoke to Paul and then to Victoria, which took quite a long time. We found that Brandon has applied for a job at Pepsico in Minniapolis!</p>
        <p>Monday 17th October</p>
        <p>While I finished showering and dealt with some email, Angela put on some washing and went down to the butchers in Steyning. So I hung it out to dry. Then we both went over to Dad's to fill his pill box, change his bed and put on his washing. After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting, with a talk from the owner of a local vineyard. I cleared the pipe to one of the water butts, checked that I could access the attendance list for talks and then reproduced the IET speaker's certificate. The original was a .docx file that did not open completely in Pages. I also discovered that the printer will take card quite easily. Then I checked the two posters for the talks I have organised and completed the feedback form for Steyning Grammar's careers day.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 18th October</p>
        <p>Angela went off to Storrington by bus to her WI bank during the morning while I experimented with the IET events attendance list and my Scratch/Arduino demonstrator, in particular the motor. After lunch Hamish called to deliver a memory stick for tonight's speaker. I also examined what would be required to install another router as a wi-fi extender. I decided that the laptop needed to be connected to the router by cable in case I could not get a wi-fi connection to the router admon pages. This took some time. Then I created an attendance sheet and went to Falmer to a talk. Unfortunately Brighton were playing at home, so the drive took twice as long as usual.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 19th October</p>
        <p>At nine o'clock I took the MG out of the garage, drove to Beeding to put in ten litres of fuel and then drove to the Queen's Head in West Chiltington to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee and a chat (Brian had read my article in the Bulletin and now wants to replace the spindles on his TA) we all took a 27-mile route to Goodwood. We did four 'parade' laps of the track and tehn had lunch in the Old Control Tower. Overall I did 77 miles. Meanwhile, Angela went to table tennis.</p>
        <p>Thursday 20th October</p>
        <p>The whole day was taken up shopping. We picked up Dad and went off to do the weekly shop. This was after Angela had been to Steyning and picked up new hearing aid batteries for Bay. Between having coffee and starting food shopping Angela bought a jumper and a shirt, and I bought a hat to use when driving the MG. So we were quite late home, as was lunch. Afterwards, Angela took his shopping to Philip and then we both went round to Bay's. I also took round the new smoke alarm and fitted it.</p>
        <p>Friday 21st October</p>
        <p>Before having a shower I managed to send messages to most of the recent additions to the IET Sussex LN. Then it was time to go to the hygienist. Meanwhile Angela went to Steyning and to Bay's. After lunch Angela went to the church to help put things back in the kitchen and I went to M&amp;S to change my hat (since one of the poppers had pulled out). I also filled the Panda with fuel for Angela's trip to Sevenoaks tomorrow. M&amp;S was heaving due to their 20% off food and home items. I then spent the rest of the day trying to set up a second router to extend the wi-fi so as to improve the performance of the Chrome Cast. It is in the network and has the same SSID, but devices will not connect to it (or transfer to it).</p>
        <p>Saturday 22nd October</p>
        <p>The day started with Angela taking her WI accounts to the auditor while I went for a newspaper. Then she set off to Sevenoaks for a youth club reunion. She got home just before seven o'clock. In the morning I did the weekly accounts and then worked on the wi-fi extention. I upgraded the firmware in my old router, but it still did not provide current-day security, so deviced connected to the study router in preference. So I changed the SSID of the extention router and, using the Chromecast app, made it connect to the new network. It seems to work. After lunch I put the back of the MG on axle stands and removed all the bolts holding the near side rear spring. All, that is, apart from the connection to the damper.</p>
        <p>Sunday 23rd October</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I walked to the newsagents at Beeding. This morning they had some papers left. Later I went back into the garage. By the end of the day I had the near side rear spring ready to remove. Unfortunately, only the rear would move on its pin, the forward, 'silentlock' was stuck fast! In between we tried to talk with Paul (but the connection was too poor to be useable) and spoke with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 24th October After Angela had walked down to Steyning we went over to Dad's to fill his pill box and turn over his bed clothes. We also made an appointment for him to see a nurse as the first part of an annual checkup. After lunch I managed, quite easily, to remove the near side rear sping from the MG and removed the old rubber bushes. The lower bushes were in quite good condition, but the upper ones were pretty bad. Angela went to give blood while I cleaned up the parts, went to Hove to buy some nuts and washers and painted (and touched up) various bits.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 25th October</p>
        <p>Angela caught the bus to Worthing this morning while I re-fitted the near-side rear spring, with the new 'rubber' bushes. I then started removing the off-side rear spring. Every nut was more difficult to remove than its counterpart on the near side. The front eye of the spring does not want to come off the pin! So I left it dripping in penetrator oil. After Angela returned from Worthing she worked in the garden. I was interrupted in the garage by Neil. He needed help to get the engine in his MGB mated to the gearbox and back in place. He had to replace the clutch thrust washer.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 26th October</p>
        <p>Success! This morning I managed to remove the off-side rear spring from the MG. Levering didn't work, but hitting the back of the spring eye with a hammer shifted it. So I spent a good part of the day cleaning up bits and painting bits. I then cleaned and applied wax to the underside of the wings and running boards. Meanwhile Angela went to Steyning in the morning and to table tennis (and to Bay's) in the afternoon. I also set up Dad's old TV. At first it would not turn on, then it worked and I could not make it fail!</p>
        <p>Thursday 27th October</p>
        <p>Nearly the end of October already. Luckily the weather is fine and still relatively warm. As usual on a Thursday we started by collecting Dad on our way to do the weekly shop, starting with coffee, of course. We got home fairly early (for a shopping day) and after lunch, while Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, I refitted the off-side rear spring, with the new polyurathane bushes. Then I touched up some areas of green paint, but decided not to paint the nuts and bolt threads of the sping fixings to the axle, before refitting the wheels, lowering the car to the ground, tightening the fore and aft bolts and painting the shackle nuts. Tomorrow I will fit split pins in the lower shackle nuts and take the car for a test drive. Today I also established that, apart from the monthly payments, all transfers into Juniper's account had been returned!</p>
        <p>Friday 28th October</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I added split pins to the nuts on the rear spring shackles and topped up the oil in the back axle. After lunch I took the car for a test run (my normal figure of eight), reaching over 50 mph on the bypass, with much more stability. When I got back I adjusted the tappets (again), making them a 'tight' 17 thou. Meanwhile, Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and to the garden centre.</p>
        <p>Saturday 29th October</p>
        <p>Angela set off at about twenty to ten to drive to Guildford to meet up with her school friends. She got home at about five o'clock. Meanwhile I walked to Beeding bridge to get a paper and updated the weekly accounts. After lunch I 'wiped' the MG and applied wax to the bodywork. I also updated OSX on the Macbook and started updating my web page on replacing spring bushes. After dinner we went round to Bay's to change her clocks.</p>
        <p>Sunday 30th October</p>
        <p>Angela was out from 10am to 4pm at church. After walking to Beeding bridge I spent quite a long time setting up another savings account and transfer money into it. I also updated our records of what money we have where. Later I did a little more to my web page about the srping bushings replacement and we then spoke to both Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 31st October</p>
        <p>Halloween, the last day of October, and after the mist/fog/ cleared it was a sunny and warm day. We spent some of the morning at Dad's doing the usual Monday chores. But, when round the corner, I had to go back because I forgot to read his meters! We called into Sainsbury's to get some cheese to take to Paul's and some Euros to help us get there. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I sent one or two email, downloaded, sorted and loaded photos of Juniper and Austin to the iPad and started compiling notes for Katherine to use at the IET AGM. Also, Mark cried off lunch tomorrow, as expected. But Simon and I will go anyway.</p>
