        <p>Monday 1st August</p>
        <p>We started by collecting Sam from the cattery and then I went to Brighton University to meet with Dean Pateman and Sam Davis on the formation of the Gift Oversight Group. I got home in time to make lunch, after which we went over to Dad's to turn over his bed and fill his pill box. We also showed him the photos and video of our visit to Paul's. When we got home Angela cooked and I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 2nd August</p>
        <p>We were not up early this morning, but I started by fitting the sender unit. I had enough petrol in the tank to turn off the warning light and cover the unit by lunch time. After lunch there didn't seem to be any leakage, so I painted the unit and the piece of tank below it with primer and left it to cure until tomorrow. Angela continued to work in the garden and I checked/updated my article for Main Gear and sent it to Roger. Later in the evening I had a call from Chris Hall.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 3rd August</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday Angela went walking with her WI group. Meanwhile I flushed through the heating system and added descaler and corrosion inhibitor. Then I gave the TC's tank sender unit a coat of paint before lunch. Later in the day I gave it another coat. Prior to that I did the monthly accounts, which took a lot of effort due to all the investment changes that we made over the past month.</p>
        <p>Thursday 4th August</p>
        <p>We did the usual shop this morning, taking Dad and starting with coffee. After lunch, while Angela took shopping to Philip and Bay, I refitted the spare wheel carrier and took the TC for the usual figure of eight circuit.</p>
        <p>Friday 5th August</p>
        <p>A good day and a not so good day! It was our 44th wedding anniversary, so we had booked tickets for the i360 in Brighton, which had openned yesterday. Our ticket was for the 11:40 'flight', but you were asked to get there half an hour earlier. We caught the 700 bus from Shoreham and got off at Grand Avenue. But we were a bit late and the i360 was further along the prom than I had thought. So we walked very quickly. Unfortunately Angela tripped and fell, grazing her knees and nose and bumped her forehead. So we walked slowly the rest of the way. We need not have rushed! There were chaotic queues, with the 11:20 flight still queuing on the pavement. We got on the pod just after twelve. Then problem two. When I tried to turn on my camera it would not work, even though I had charged the battery and tested it on Tuesday. So I had to take photos with my phone. It was grey and dull while we went up and down, being sunny earlier and later. After our 'flight' we walked up into Brighton and had lunch in an unusual cafe/bar. We then caught the 700 back to Shoreham and I cut the grass. The third problem of the day was that the new ink cartridges would not fit the printer! So I ordered a set of what I hope are the right type.</p>
        <p>Saturday 6th August</p>
        <p>Another day out, and a fine sunny day at that. After walking to the Beeding newsagents we walked again to the Bramber roundabout and caught the 11:30 number 3 bus to Horsham. We arrived just after 12:30 and walked through the town to the 'kitchen' shop and had lunch in their cafe. We then walked back, through Swan Walk and via M&amp;S, where I bought two pairs of trousers, and on to John Lewis. We then walked back to Carfax and sat, eating icecream and listening to the Croydon Brass Band. After another walk and sit, we went back to the bus station and caught the bus back to Steyning, getting home just before six.</p>
        <p>Sunday 7th August</p>
        <p>We were not particularly early this morning, but Angela took Philip to church while I walked to the newsagents. I then did the weekly accounts. After lunch I ran the TC's engine till it was warm and then measured the compression in each cylinder. All were between 70psi and 85 psi, but I was expecting them to be 120psi! I used the starting handle to turn over the engine and repeated each test several times. We then talked to Paul and Victoria, telling them both that we would give them a present, Paul for something for the barn and Victoria for a digital piano.</p>
        <p>Monday 8th August</p>
        <p>After Angela went to Steyning we drove over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. We were also there while British Gas came to service his boiler. Then Angela did some pruning in his garden and I removed 'dead' batteries from wherever I could find them. After a late lunch Angela worked in the garden and I sent an e-mail to the IET committee about engaging with students. I also did a first read of the GOG policies and Terms of Reference drafts. After a lot of effort and telephone calls to Barclays I got our online access to our account unblocked and I transferred &#163;10K to my Shawbrook account (again). Then I drafted an e-mail to the IET education man.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 9th August</p>
        <p>Angela walked to Beeding after lunch and went to a WI quiz night after an early tea. However, I did not venture out today. I e-mailed the IET education people and sent a note to the Sussex LN committee about the prizes at Brighton. I also created a web page for our first trip to Rotterdam. I tried once again to move money into the OakNorth account, but it was delayed again for checks, although only until tomorrow. Nevertheless there was no phone call.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 10th August</p>
        <p>Just before 10 o'clock this morning I set off in the TC for Pulborough Brooks. I was the first of the MG drivers there and almost missed the sign saying where we should park. There were about 18 cars of all types, including an 18/80. Someone who's MGA was out of action and came in his Seat offerred to navigate, so after coffee we set off on a 25 mile run to Balls Cross. It was a good run and we sat in the garden to eat lunch. I then took Bob back to Pulborough Brooks before coming home, 59 miles in all. Meanwhile Anglea went to her table tennis club barbecue.</p>
        <p>Thursday 11th August</p>
        <p>Since I was due to be picked up at 1:30 we started the shopping run a little earlier than usual. In fact Dad had only just got home after buying his paper. After an early lunch, Hamish picked me up at about 1:45 and drove me to Moulsecoombe where we delivered the equipment for the IET workshops to STEM Sussex. He then drove me home. Meanwhile Angela had taken Philip his shopping and then took Bay her's. I then jacked up the front of the TC, slackened off the domed nuts on the cotter pins, tapped them and sightened the nuts. I also checked the tightness of the other backplate and steering bolts.</p>
        <p>Friday 12th August</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to Steyning I filled the cracks in the sitting room walls. After lunch I registered for the IET President's Address, updated people on the mg-tabc group about my spindle replacement and then pruned the apple trees.</p>
        <p>Saturday 13th August</p>
        <p>The weather was fine for our walk to the newsagents at Beeding bridge, although we were quite late. There was little time to do other than sand over the filler I put in yesterday and paint the areas. I used a small roller so as to try to get a similar finish to the original. After lunch and catching up with some of the Olympics results Angela returned to her shredding and I took a few photos of the back of the TC's dash so as to see where the trip reset might go and how the speedo is fixed. There is a hole in the speedo casing and you can see a square pin. It seems that there should be a cable that allows you to push in and then turn this pin so as to rewind the trip meter. I then did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Sunday 14th August</p>
        <p>Angela was giving Philip a lift to church this morning, so I had access to the TC to look at the speedo. I removed it and found that the visible square pin could be pulled out (by about 1/8th of an inch) and rotated to zero the trip meter. I also found that a 4mm diameter brass tube was a tight push fit on the square pin. So I cut a short length of tube and put heat-shrink on one end. Then I put the instrument back. I have to reach under the dash to zero the trip. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I documented my work on the speedo and did a little on the Moth. Tehn we spoke to both Victoria and Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 15th August</p>
        <p>A busy day. This morning I went to Dad's to fill his pill box and turn over his bed clothes. Meanwhile Angela did washing. Angela was going on the WI Outing for lunch and to go on a boat trip on the Wey and Arun canal at Loxwood and had a full car, until someone cried off. So I took the seat (actually the driver's seat). We picked up two people and headed off to Loxwood for lunch in the pub and then a pleasant trip through two locks and back again. Then, after dinner we took the TC to the West Sussex MG Owners Club meeting at Worthing Rugby Club. The talk was on the National Coastwatch at Shoreham. We did 35 miles in all.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 16th August</p>
        <p>A less rushed day today. Anglea walked twice to Steyning, once in the morning and again in the afternoon. Meanwhile I got out the strimmer, cleared under the trees at the front and the path and under the trees at the bottom of the garden. Then, later int he day I cut the front grass and half the rear grass. In between I tightened the passenger handle in the TC and cleaned the windscreen.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 17th August</p>
        <p>Today I demonstrated how stupid I can be. During the morning I charged the LiPo batteries for the Cub while I finished cutting the back grass. Meanwhile Angela went walking with her WI goup and had lunch in the Castle Inn. After lunch I tested the Cub in the garden and all seemed to work well, including a range test. At about three thirty I drove up to the flying site, firstly to find that the combination for the lock on the gate had changed. I then put the Cub together. Initially the servos were moving in jerks, so I diconnected the battery and reconnected it. All was then well, including a range test. By this time a lot of people were leaving or had left, so I took the Cub to an empty field, in the sunshine and with a steady breeze. I turned on the transmitter and then the plane and there were no beeps from teh ESC. I took the plane back to the car and changed the battery. I got the beeps the first time that I connected the battery, but not afterwards. So I came home without a flight. On investigation I found that the ESC only beeps when the power is first connected. If I had tried the controls I would have found that they worked! So there was really no problem.</p>
        <p>Thursday 18th August</p>
        <p>A day of shopping and watching TV! We did our usual weekly shop, taking Dad to Holmebush. Consequently we were late having lunch and late finishing it. While Angela walked around to Philip's to take him his shopping I glued the battery end plate back into the Cub and then started watching the triathlon from Rio. Apart from a short time away, I spent the rest of the afternoon watching it. Angela got back just before the finish and then drove around to Bay's. Meanwhile, I prepared dinner (parma ham pasta) and cooked it when Angela got home.</p>
        <p>Friday 19th August</p>
        <p>While Angela walked to Steyning and to Bay's I transferred the 'piano' money to Victoria's account and then put the Cub back together. This took nearly until lunchtime. After lunch Angela went in the garden and I started sorting out the information for Angela's tax return. This meant starting by working through two year's worth of filing! There is still a lot to do.</p>
        <p>Saturday 20th August</p>
        <p>Just before we left to walk to the Beeding newsagents Bay phoned to say that she had not received her newspaper. She had phoned the newsagents, but the papers were late and they can't get one to her. So we walked down to Steyning instead, picked up her paper, bought one for us and was asked to take another for Bay's neighbour. Then we walked to Bay's, fitted a new bulb in her oven and had coffee before walking home. Angela then started taming the rose on the trellis and I continued collecting information for her tax return. After lunch she caught the bus to Holmebush to look for trousers in the M&amp;S sale, getting home just before four. Meanwhile I took the top plate off the TC's steering box and added just a little oil. When Angela got home she continued with the rose and honeysuckle and I continued with her tax. </p>
        <p>Sunday 21st August</p>
        <p>Angela took Philip to church again, so I walked to the Beeding newsagents alone. Before lunch I worked out Angela's tax for last year and did the weekly accounts. After lunch I did a little work on the Moth and then we spoke with Paul (from his barn) and with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 22nd August</p>
        <p>We started the day by going over to Dad's. I filled his pill box while Angela changed his bed. We then put on his washing and went into the garden. Angela started cutting down weeds and bushes while I cleared the ivy and other growth from around the shed. By then it was too late to consider starting to paint the shed, so we went to Lyons Farm to buy shed paint in B&amp;Q and buy some food in Sainsbury's. We also had some lunch there, since it was getting late. When we got home Angela did some shredding and I worked on the Moth. I completed the central frame.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 23rd August</p>
        <p>We spent the morning at Dad's, where I painted two sides of his shed and Angela pruned bushes. I will need to return tomorrow to paint the other two sides! After a late lunch I spent quite a long time getting the back door bell working while Angela walked to Steyning. Then I read email and started looking at the next stage of the Tiger Moth build. I discovered that I have put the side sheeting on before fitting the cabane wires. This may be a problem!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 24th August</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI group I went over to Dad's to finish painting his shed. When I got there I realised that I had left the paintbrush at home! I could not find any in Dad's shed, so came home for it. The back of the shed was less weathered than the rest and so tokk less time and used less paint. So what was left I put in the shed. and got home just after Angela and in time to make lunch. Afterwards I started making the canbane wires for the Moth. However, I need to put that on hold for a while while I repari the Cub! I charged the batteries and about four o'clock went up to the flying field. I took off for the first flight on the second attempt. It was very erratic, but I managed a reasonable landing on the second attempt. We then moved round to the Western box, by which time the wind had picked up. However, I took off and did a couple of circuits, but my landing was in the long grass and the engine mount disintegrated!</p>
        <p>Thursday 25th August</p>
        <p>We showered before setting off on the weekly food shopping trip, picking up Dad on the way. After a late lunch (and watching some afternoon TV!) Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay while I dismantled the broken front of the Cub. I decided to turn the motor round the other way, so that the mount is at the rear and I can build a stronger, box-shaped mounting structure. This will mean fitting the other propeller attachment and making a larger hole in the cowl. However, I need to try to repair the cowl since it was torn off its fixing screws. I started cutting a new motor mount base plate from 1/8th ply (rather than the original light ply) using the original as a template.</p>
        <p>Friday 26th August</p>
        <p>After breakfast Angela walked to Steyning while I prepared the TC for an outing. We then set off to Nymans (via the Beeding petrol station) where we started with coffee before walking around the garden. We were surprised how many people were there. We also went into the house and around an exhibition from the V&amp;A on Vivienne Liegh. After lunch in the cafe we walked through the woods before driving home. Unfortunately my 'repaired' trip reset did not reset! We got home, after a very sunny day, about four o'clock, in time for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Saturday 27th August</p>
        <p>We were up late and walked to the Beeding newsagents. Angela then went in the garden while I did the weekly accounts. After lunch Angela continued in the garden and I continued trying to make a new motor mount for the Cub.</p>
        <p>Sunday 28th August</p>
        <p>While Angela took Philip to church I walked to the Beeding newsagents and then on to Bay's. She phoned last night to say that there had been a power cut and her oven would not work. So I reset her alarm clock and the time on her oven. I also measured her waist, since she has put on weight and her trousers will not do up when she is sitting. So she wants us to get her some new ones. When I got home I moved the TC into the middle of the garage. After lunch, while Angela worked in the garden I checked the plugs and points on the TC and topped up the oil. There are still a number of things to check before the SDR. Later we spoke to Paul and to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 29th August</p>
        <p>Although today was a bank holiday we started with our usual trip to Dad's to fill his pill box and turn over his bed clothes. However, we then went to M&amp;S to get Bay some larger trousers. Luckily the two pair we bought fitted her. After lunch, while Angela went to Bay's, I checked the gearbox oil and brake fluid levels and removed the tonau floor to get at the differential. I cleaned off any oil and put powder on it to try to locate the oil leak. There were two pieces of wood in the bottom of the side-screen box, whereas Sherrill only shows one. So I managed to remove the extra piece, exposing the corroded base of the box. I cleaned it up with wire wool and put a coat of black Hammerite on the inside and outside. I also emailed Daniel at STEM Sussex about Hamish and I becoming deleiverers and emailed Hamish about potential schools events.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 30th August</p>
        <p>Progress on a number of fronts today. Angela went to Steyning and worked in the garden. Whereas I cut a piece of wood to fit in the base of the side screen box and 'painted' it with three coats of wood preservative. I also put preservative on parts of the car's frame. I also decided that the oil leak from the differential is from the main gasket. So I topped up teh oil level and checked the tightness of various bolts, needing to tighten tose holding on the badge bar. Then I removed the speedo, took it apart and discovered what I needed to do to make the brass tube reset the trip meter. I now just need to test it, although I did update the web page. I also emailed STEM Sussex about Hamish and I becoming deliverers and emialed Hamish about potential schools events.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 31st August</p>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI group while I was still in the bathroom. I then spent the morning putting the MG back together in preparation for the SDR. Later I also touched up a little paint. After lunch Angela went into the garden and I assembled the front of the Cub, only to find that I had got the motor too low! So I took it apart and started making a new mount. I also 'played' with the micro:bit.</p>
