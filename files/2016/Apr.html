        <p>Friday 1st April</p>
        <p>This morning we started by looking online at kitchen tables. The only one we can find that seems to fit (physically and stylistically) is from M&amp;S, but we can't view it first. However, we can order it for collection at a store and then take it back if we don't like it. If we order it tomorrow then we should be able to collect it on Monday. Then Angela walked to Steyning and I put the scooter together. After lunch we went back to Steyning and bought a high chair in the Oxfam shop. I then went to Speedy Spares in Portslade to buy some engine oil and spark plugs and then to the model shop for some brass tube and piano wire. When I got home I cleaned the high chair and worked out how to adjust it. After dinner I went to the flying club auction. It was clearly going to go on late, so I left at the interval.</p>
        <p>Saturday 2nd April</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to the Beeding newsagents I spent the rest of the morning (after reading some of the paper) doing the weekly and monthly accounts while Angela worked in the garden. She was back there after lunch, shredding this time. Meanwhile I took the MG for a run to warm the engine and then drained out the oil. My aim had been to adjust the tappets while the oil was draining, but it took longer than planned to remove the oil filter and find the plan for adjusting the valves. So the engine was not quite as warm by the time I came to tackle the tappets. Instead of 19 thou, I decided to adjust them to 17 thou. Even then, I had to open them all a little. I fitted the new filter, but have yet to fill the sump with oil.</p>
        <p>Sunday 3rd April</p>
        <p>Although I don't really have time to read another newspaper, we walked to the Beeding newsagents, with Angela then going on to church and me returning home. I read some of yesterday's paper and then filled the TC's sump with oil. I put in 8 1/8 pints only to find that the dipstick showed the level between half and full. So I added another pint. After lunch I jacked up the front and greased the steering joints. I started to jack up the rear when it was time to talk with Victoria and then with Paul. I can only get at the propshaft universal joints and spline grease points by having both ends off the ground.</p>
        <p>Monday 4th April</p>
        <p>I started by sending an e-mail to my speaker for the electron microscopy talk, only to find later that he was leaving all of the talking to the Hitachi man and that the Hitachi man could now not come. And his fallback person we being sent to Germany! In between we went to Dad's in the morning to fill his pill box, change his bed and do his washing. We also dicovered that his assertion that his fence was fine was an exageration. He needs seven new panels! After lunch I jacked up the rear of the MG and greased the propshaft. Then the new kitchen table arrived and I assembled it.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 5th April</p>
        <p>I sent a few e-mail about the electron microscopy talk and then we started by going to Dad's to clear a path to the various fence panels that need replacing. We called in to Meakers only to find that they would take six weeks to deliver them, would not not fit them and would not take the old ones away! We then took his old garden fridge to the tip and went into Worthing to pay the balance on the hire car, have lunch and get some things for Rowan. Later, after sending more e-mail, I cleaned out as much of the thick oil from the steering box as I could and filled it with EP140. Either the oil seal leaks or someone thought that the car would steer better with thick oil in the steering box. Then I went to the IET talk in Crawley.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 6th April</p>
        <p>My speaker problem seems to be resolved. Mike Wombwell sent me a list of possible contacts and the first can do it. So a telephone call and then several e-mail sorted it. I also arranged for someone to look at Dad's fence and give an estimate. After lunch I went next door to help Mel and Terry print documents from their iPad. Then I did some more servicing jobs on the TC (adjusted the brakes, cleaned the filter in the petrol pump, greased the water pump bearing and the dynamo bearing). Meanwhile Angela went to table tennis. After an early dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to see 'Bridge of Spies'.</p>
        <p>Thursday 7th April</p>
        <p>While Angela went to the health centre to get new hearing aid batteries I dealt with some e-mail, including drafting one to Steve Chapman about the possible use of the Castle Hotel. Tehn we went shopping, picking Dad up on the way. We were quite late home, so it was three o'clock before I got into the garage while Angela went to Philip's and Bay's. I took of one front and one rear wheel. Then tried to remove what I thought was dried grease, but which turned out to be a thin metal disc attached to some rubbery substance, all heald in by some lighter coloured rubbery substance. I took photos and e-mailed the TC technical man at the Octagon Car Club. Angela was quite late back, so I cooked the fish pie!</p>
        <p>Friday 8th April</p>
        <p>This morning I sent some e-mail and then spent most of the rest of the morning reading IET documents and doing their data protection courses. I also started looking at the micro:bit. After lunch I went into the garage, removed the other rear hub centre 'plug', cleaned the hub splines and re-greased them, put some old engine oil on the springs and touched up areas of the green Hammerite (and areas that Chris had missed). I also looked at adjusting the handbrake, but found that the butterfly adjuster was already at the end of its travel. This month's Main Gear arrived. The photos on the front cover ande the only real article inside are mine!</p>
        <p>Saturday 9th April</p>
        <p>We walked to the Beeding newsagents as usual for a Saturday morning. Then, after reading some of the paper, Angela went into the garden and I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling the bank statement. Since it was close to lunchtime I did a little to the Moth's central frame. I have now soldered the remaining parts (the new pencil torch works, albeit a little tempramentally) and started re-assembling it. After lunch (and reading more of the paper) I took the TC off the axle stands, lubricated the distributor and oiled the carburetter linkages. I also oiled the door hinges and catches. Greasing the speed and rev counter cables seems to require taking them out, so I'll leave that for now. I also couldn't see how to get at the windscreen wiper motor spindle so as to oil it. The aim is to take the car for a run tomorrow to warm the gearbox and differential before draining the oil.</p>
        <p>Sunday 10th April</p>
        <p>A walk to the newsagents and then, while Angela went to church, I drove the TC to Washington roundabout and back so as to warm up the gearbox and differential. I then drained both. To fill them I had to remove the tonou floor and the gearbox cover (which meant removing the front carpets). I then was also able to check the brake fluid and the fluid levels in the rear dampers. So the service is now done apart from greasing the hubs, greasing the speedo and tachometer cables and oiling the windscreen wiper motor. After lunch, while I was filling the gearbox and and differential, Angela cut the front grass and most of the rear grass. When I had finished putting the car back together I finished cutting the grass. We then spoke with Paul and later, after dinner, with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 11th April</p>
        <p>Angela went fairly early to ghelp with the lunch club. Meanwhile I went off to Dad's to help him change his bed and to fill his pill box. After lunch I dealt with e-mail, created a DVLA check code, for the car hire company to use, and continued assembling the Tiger Moth's central frame mechanism. Later in the afternoon I went to Crawley for the IET Sussex LN committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 12th April</p>
        <p>It was a gloriously sunny, warm and calm day. So in a way it seemed like a wasted day. I started by getting the buggy down from the loft and then cleaned away the old gear oil (and the bowl and container). When I started looking at the printer (it was jamming) it gave a 'general error' whenever I powered it on. So after searching various places I ordered a basic Epsom printer/scanner from Staples. Unfortunately it will not use the ink cartridges that I've just bought! I then spent a good part of the afternoon writing up the minutes of last night's IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 13th April</p>
        <p>Another glorious sunny day. Angela went to Steyning and after lunch went to her last table tennis club of the season. Meanwhile I took the TC to Shoreham Airport to meet the Sussex Wanderers. We then set of to West Chiltington for lunch, via Bramber, Small Dole, Blackstone, Partridge Green and Dial Post. I got home at about 3:15 and put both cars in the garage.</p>
        <p>Thursday 14th April</p>
        <p>It is half past eight. Brandon has gone to bed, Victoria is trying to go to bed, with Juniper, and Austin is trying to find another story book for Angela to read to him. We started early (for us) and were at the car hire shop by Worthing station just after nine. I collected the hire car, which turned out to be new, having just done a couple of hundred miles. It has six gears and an electronic handbrake. It also has a heavy and awkward clutch and on several occasions I have put it in the wrong gear. Angela went off to do the weekly shop and then deliver the food to Dad, Philip and Bay. Meanwhile I drove the hire car home and then off to Gatwick to meet Victoria et al. They made good time through the airport and we were home by 2:15. They were very tired (Austin and Juniper went to sleep in the car and stayed asleep for a while), but V&amp;B had some lunch and then B had a short sleep. We then played with Austin, put on some washing, all had dinner, Juniper and Austin had a bath and so we are all now exhausted!</p>
        <p>Friday 15th April</p>
        <p>A quieter day, at least from mid-morning. Victoria and Brandon packed for the weekend this morning and, belatedly we printed off their bording passes. So they left 25 minutes later than planned, but we got to Gatwick in time for them to have a snack before flying off to Amsterdam. On the way back we called into Nymans garden for coffee. After lunch Angela went to Steyning while I cleared up, e-mailed my new electron microscopy speaker and dealt with other e-mail. Then I discovered why I was having problems accessing the mg-tabc Yahoo group.</p>
        <p>Saturday 16th April</p>
        <p>This morning we walked to the Beeding newsagents and then on to the health centre in Steyning via the river bank. It was 11:30 before we were home and just after 12 before we had finished coffee and a read of some of the paper. So I did the weekly accounts while Angela brought in the washing (in the rain) that she had put out when we got home! After lunch Angela went in the garden, I thought to garden. But she also cleared some parts of the gutters. Meanwhile, I e-mailed a couple of people about the IET talk on Tuesday and started making the rudder controls for the Tiger Moth. In between I checked the oil and water in the MG. The oil is below 'full', so I will need to top it up.</p>
        <p>Sunday 17th April</p>
        <p>This morning I had to walk on to the BP petrol station, since the Beeding newsagents had run out of Telegraphs. Mean while, Angela went on to church. I then spent a lot of the day (other than reading the paper) making the rear rudder bar for the Moth. Angela spent most of the afternoon in the garden, until we spoke to Victoria and Paul in Berkenwoude. I also received confirmation from Michael Mooney that he would be there on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Monday 18th April</p>
        <p>I went over to Dad's this morning while Angela went to Steyning and prepared sandwiches for her WI meeting. I helped him change his bed and put his washing on. Then I filled his pill box, and had coffee. We then hung out his washing before I came home, via Sainsbury's so as to fill the Panda with petrol, just in time to make lunch. Afterwards I took Angela to the Steyning Centre with her stuff for her meeting. I then did a little modeling before leaving for Gatwick. Their flight was due to land at 15:55, but the online arrivals page said 'expected at 16:10. So I arrived at 4:30 only to find that the plane did not land until 16:22! So I had a 30 minute wait for them. Another &#163;7 in the car park! We were home just after six.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 19th April</p>
        <p>Angela's birthday! She had 10 cards, even if one did arrive a day late. We took Austin and Juniper to teh Fletchers Croft playground, while V&amp;B went to Balloos for lunch. We just had sandwiches and Austin had fish fingers. They all walked to Bay's after lunch and got back just in time for us (Angela and I) to change and go to the Castle to meet our speaker for the IET talk on electron microscopy. We had arranged to leave early since Brighton were playing at home. However, it took us an hour to get there due to solid traffic from Devils Dyke. It seems that the A27 was blocked by an accident. So not many people arrived for the talk, with Katherine arriving part-way through. So we did the presentation at the end. It was then quite late, so we took Steve Chapman and his wife to the steak house in North Lancing. I was good, but we did not get home until just after eleven!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 20th April</p>
        <p>I went off to collect Dad and take him to his dermatology appointment at Southlands, while the others walked into Steyning. On the way back from Southlands I filled the hire car with diesel and got Dad some cash. After lunch we went to Steyning again so that V could get passport photos of Juniper. Austin played in the Fletchers Croft playground. Then we all went off to Lancing Green. Austin was not that interested in the beach, but liked the playground, even though there was not much there. On the way back we stopped at Dad's for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Thursday 21st April</p>
        <p>Angela and I had breakfast and went off to do the weekly shop, leaving everyone else to fend for themselves. We had delivered food to Dad and got home by twelve. Angela took food to Philip while I prepared lunch. After lunch we took V et al to Southwater Country Park so that Austin could play on Dinosaur Island. He had fun and we then walked to the cafe where we had tea and he had an icecream. When we got home I took Bay her food while Angela cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 22nd April</p>
        <p>After a shower, I started with a visit to the hygienist while Angela walked to Steyning. After lunch we all too a trip to Lyons Farm to go to Boots and Halfords. Victoria wanted Austin to choose a pair of sunglasses for his forthcomming birthday and they wanted some straps to go round their case. Otherwise we played games and helped with baths.</p>
        <p>Saturday 23rd April</p>
        <p>An early start. We all had breakfast and then I took V et al off to Haywards Heath station. They went into London, firstly to the Natural History Museum and then to Emily's wedding. I collected them from the 9:30 train at Haywards Heath. Meanwhile, Angela went to buy a paper this morning and walked down to Steyning this afternoon. When I got home I did the weekly accounts and this afternoon checked over the MG, topping up the oil and taking it to Beeding to get some petrol.</p>
        <p>Sunday 24th April</p>
        <p>77 miles! That was the distance that Brandon and I took the TC today as part of Drive-It Day. We went to a pub in Cootham for coffee and then drove down many back lanes (until we all thought we were lost) to get to another paub in Elsted. After a good (but late) lunch we drove back through Midhurst and Petworth. While we were driving through the Sussex countryside, Angela took Victoria, Austin and Juniper to a garden centre at Pulborough that has a narrow gauge steam railway. Austin had three rides on the train!</p>
        <p>Monday 25th April</p>
        <p>Angela went down to Steyning before we all went over to Dad's. We arrived just as the fence man was finishing and so got Dad to sign a cheque for him. Then it was back for lunch before Victoria, Brandon and Juniper walked down to Steyning to post some letters and buy some gifts. We (and Austin) then went to Bay's to meet them. We had a cup of tea with her before returning home for dinner. I also managed to reply to Worthing College about Lego League support and to Steyning Grammer about their Future's Day. In between I replied to Bernard, summarising the committee's view on changing the date of the next meeting so that Nigel Fines can attend.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 26th April</p>
        <p>Suposedly a quieter day today. We mainly played with Austin and Juniper, while V&amp;B packed, and went to Shoreham for lunch at an Italian restaurant. We had an excellent lunch, A&amp;J being very good. However, in spite of it being quiet, we are now exhausted!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 27th April</p>
        <p>I started by taking Victoria et al to Gatwick, getting home in time to have a first pass at the Springboard assessments. After lunch we went to the garden centre to get compost, grass feed, canes and been seeds. I then walked to the hairdresser's only to find that they were closed. While Angela planted seeds, I cleaned most of the mud from under the TC's wings and, after dinner, completed the Springboard assessment and sent it off.</p>
        <p>Thursday 28th April</p>
        <p>We started the day by taking the hire car back to near Worthing station. Angela followed and picked me up and took me on to Dad's where we compiled his shopping list and then went off to Holmbush. As usual, we started with coffee and then did the shopping. It was nearly two o'clock before we were home. After lunch Angela took the shopping to Phillip and Bay and I walked to Beeding to have my hair cut. I then spent the rest of the afternoon dealing with e-mail on IET and Brighton Springboard grant matters. After dinner I transferred my 'Process Automation' slide set, that I use in schools, to Keynote.</p>
        <p>Friday 29th April</p>
        <p>This morning I started producing a slide set to use for the Steyning Grammer Futures Day, while Angela went to Steyning. after a very early lunch I went to the Springboard Grants panel meeting at Moulescombe. I had been asked to chair the meeting, which was easy since there were only three people who could make it. When I got home I cut the grass, front and back while Angela finished cooking dinner and cakes for the flower festival tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Saturday 30th April</p>
        <p>Today would have been Mum's birthday. We started by collecting Phillip and taking him to the flower festivial at the church. Angela went in to start preparing lunches and I went to buy a paper before going in to sell lunch tickets. Although it was a slow start, by two o'clock I had sold 54 lunches and some puddings. So after a late lunch I took Phillip home and then read some of the paper and dealt with e-mail. I also started documenting our trip to the Isle of Wight in 2013. Angela walked home and we had a late supper.</p>
