        <p>Thursday 1st September</p>
        <p>When we arrived at Dad's this morning, on our way to do the weekly shop, we could tell that he did not feel right. He had been to the corner shop for his paper, but was now feeling dizzy. So he decided not to join us. However, this did not seem to make us any quicker. He was feeling better by the time that we got back with his food. After a late lunch Angela took Philip's food to him while I worked on my second version of a motor mount. Then, when Angela too the Panda round to Bay's I took the MG to the Beeding petrol station and put 40 litres in the tank! This is the most that I have ever put into the car at one time. I did the usual figure of eight in the sunshine and with the roof down. I could hear a rattle from the near side when the car went over bumps in the road, so I pulled things around to try to find it. All I could find was some play in the near side wheel, which seemed to be coming from the hub (the off side was fine). So I jacked up the front of the car, removed the wheel and checked the tightness of the hub retaining nut. This seemed fine, so it is probably wear in the bearings.</p>
        <p>Friday 2nd September</p>
        <p>Most of the day was wasted building the parts for another motor mount that would not allow me to get at the engine bolts! So back to the drawing board. Meanwhile Angela went to Steyning and helped Sandie at the church and sorted out her coffee morning posters and lunch club details. After dinner I went to a SRFC meeting for a presentation from Ripmax.</p>
        <p>Saturday 3rd September</p>
        <p>As usual we walked to the Beeding newsagents after breakfast. So by the time we had got back, had coffee and read some of the paper, half the morning had gone. We then went in the garden, where I pulled and cut down as much of the dead ivy as I could from next door's conifer. Angela stayed in the garden and I did the weekly and monthly accounts, which took mee well into the afternoon. Then it was time for a redesign of the Cub's motor mount, starting on paper, designed around the centre of the motor shaft. I marked out the front and rear formers and cut out the front one.</p>
        <p>Sunday 4th September</p>
        <p>Today we had a long, tiring, but enjoyable day. We set off this morning in the MG and drove to a cafe above Arundel (just off Whiteways roundabout), which was the start of the South Downs Run (organised by the West Sussex MG Owners Club). We left there at about 9:30 and followed a route (that went through Bramber and along the lee side of the Downs) to Eastbourne, 84 miles by our trip meter. About 200 MGs took part in the run. We stopped at the Castle Hotel in Bramber for coffee and then arrived in Eastbourne at one o'clock. After eating our packed lunch on the promenade and walking along to the pier and back, wee left at 3:15 and arrived home, having driven along the coast road through Newhaven and Brighton, just before five. We did a total of 134 miles, with the hood down all the way. It was overcast and not particularly warm, but it stayed dry. We are now very weary.ï»¿ Nevertheless, we spoke to Paul and then, after dinner, to Victoria. She is thinking of applying for a full-time lab job in Davis and Brandon is thinking of applying for a job in Miniapolis!</p>
        <p>Monday 5th September</p>
        <p>We started the day by going over to Dad's. I went with him to the doctor's, while Angela changed his bed. He will get an appointment at the dermatology clinic at Southlands to look at the growth on his ear. The doctor thought that his dizzy spells might be caused by small particles in his ear canal that move and brush against the balance hairs. She tried some head movements to see if she could bring on the dizziness and move the particles out of the way, but no effect. She gave him some excercises to do that might have the same effect. We then put on his washing and filled his pill box. After lunch I cut out the remaining pieces for a new motor mount for the Cub and started gluing them together. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden, splitting up a clivia plant. Having received an email from Daniel at STEM Sussex about becoming a 'deliverer' I phoned him and found that we can still run workshops as volunteer STEM Ambassadors.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 6th September</p>
        <p>This morning Angela caught the 106 bus to Worthing, getting home at about 2:30. I completed gluing the new motor mount and fitted it to the fuselage. I also tried repairing the cowl, but have yet to fit it. I then topped up the oil in the MG (it used about half a litre during the 134 miles) and put some padding around the fuel pipe as it comes up to the pump and the near side brake pipe to stop them touching the bodywork. My hope it that these were causing the rattle, although I have my doubts. I also cleaned under the wings and wiped down the bodywork. I found that there is still 7 1/2 gallons in the tank and that, when it was nearly full, had leaked from the filler, leaving a stain down the tank. I also lent Niel my jerry can since the fuel tank on his MGB seems to be rusty and leaking and probably needs replacing.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 7th September</p>
        <p>This morning I fitted the cowl on the Cub and late this afternoon I went up to the flying site, having charged the batteries after lunch. I had two flights (one with a perfect landing and one in the long grass) and someone helped me trim the plane on the second flight. I need to increase the motor offset since the rudder trim is too large. In spite of there being no wind down here, it was quite breezy up on the Downs. Angela had her first table tennis session of the year this afternoon. I also paid Dad's gardener and paid the Panda's road tax.</p>
        <p>Thursday 8th September</p>
        <p>In spite of dire warnings on the radio about traffic around Lancing we picked up Dad as usual and went to do the weekly food shopping. The lists were short and so we were home reasonably early. While Angela took the shopping to Philip and to Bay I cut the front and rear grass. I also finished removing weeds from the gutter in the road. Later I cut a 'shim' for the Cub's motor and started fitting it. This should add nearly two degrees more offset, which may be too much.</p>
        <p>Friday 9th September</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela walked to Steyning and then went off to buy food for the lunch club, I finished installing the 'shim' on the Cub's motor mount to increase the offset. I also set up dual rates on the transmitter for rudder elevator and ailerons. After an early lunch Hamish came with the IET torch kits and literature, but we went off to STEM Sussex at Moulescoomb first to collect equipment that we want for STEM fairs. On our return we sorted out the torch kits and literature and phoned the IET to order more.</p>
        <p>Saturday 10th September</p>
        <p>We were late up this morning, but walked to the Beeding newsagents as usual after breakfast. Then Angela worked in the garden and I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling the bank statement. After lunch Angela went back in the garden, seeding two areas of grass, and I created two video clips of Dad from the video that I recorded some time ago. I uploaded these, along with an updated html file. I also booked Sam into a cattery in Small Dole at the beginning of November and booked our flights to Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>Sunday 11th September</p>
        <p>Angela gave Philip a lift to church while I walked to Beeding (the newsagents and then the petrol station) for a paper. After downloading a couple of photos of the MG from Tom's blog site I started trying to bend wire for the Moth's canbane. Over the course of the morning and afternoon I tried about five times and either maked teh wire incorrectly or the wire broke! Before starting to prepare dinner we also spoke firstly with Paul et al and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 12th September</p>
        <p>It was lunch club day. So I took Angela (and three trifles) to the church before coming home for a shower. Then I went over to Dad's to fill his pill box and turn over his bed clothes. I had lunch with him and then recorded two more video clips. Angela just beat me home. I then had another try at making one of the canbane wires. My attempt had the top bend a little too high. So I enaled the wire, bent it back straight and bent it in the right place. Then I hardened it, but it snapped as soon as I touched it! After tea we went to the WSMGOC meeting at the Worthing Rugby Club. The talk was on the American Presidential system.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 13th September</p>
        <p>For me today was a day doing odds and ends. Angela went down to Steyning this morning and to a WI committee meeting this afternoon. Meanwhile I spoke to Hamish about the STEM week at Lancing College and, since he was out of the office, I emailed Daniel at STEM Sussex and then emailed the teacher at Lancing. I tried again to make one of the canbane wires and again it broke. So I did some research on the heat treatment of piano wire and realised that my previous attempts had annealed it before bending and hardened it after bending, but failed to temper it. So finally I managed to make one of the four wires.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 14th September</p>
        <p>I left home in the TC at 9:45 this morning and drove north of Partridge Green to The Orchard, a cafe on the A272, just east of the Buckbarn crossroad. There I met the rest of the Sussex Wanderers for coffee before we set off for the Bluebell Railway station at Sheffield Park, some 28 miles. Most people went on a train to have lunch, but a few of us ate in the station cafe. I came home via Ditchling and Poynings, arriving about three o'clock. Angela got home from table tennis at about four. I then re-worked my TC Outings web page.</p>
        <p>Thursday 15th September</p>
        <p>I phoned Daniel at STEM Sussex before we left to go food shopping and emailed Lancing College after lunch to say that I would be collecting the Control Technology workshop equipment tomorrow afternoon and would drop the software installation CD into their Lancing site on my way home. After sending Krista details of her latest parcel and flight times to Paul I refitted the side screens to the TC jacked up the front, supporting it under the chassis. I then leavered the wheel up and down looking for anything that moved and might be causing the 'clatter' as we go over bumps. I discovered that one of the damper fixing bolts was loose. In fact it is not the right size (at least the bolt head is smaller and is AF rather than BSW, although the bolt shaft might be the right size). I tightened it and the other bolt and noticed that the rubber bushes at the rear of the front springs on both sides are cracked. They don't seem to allow excessive movement of the shackle, but probably should be replaced. Meanwhile, Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, so we had a late dinner. We had to eat scampi, since we had forgotten to put Bay's packet of scampi in the freezer when we got home!</p>
        <p>Friday 16th September</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent researching shackles on the front springs of the TC and the polyurathane bushes that would be needed. Meanwhile, Angela walked to Steyning. After lunch I went to STEM Sussex to collect the control technology equipment, but they couldn't find the software CD. I'd said that I would drop it in to Lancing College for their IT man on the way back. So I copied my copy (after much tribulation) and took it down to the college. Unfortunately, the files that were emailed to me do not seem to be for the handouts that we use.</p>
        <p>Saturday 17th September</p>
        <p>After our walk to the Beeding newsagents and while Angela worked in the garden, I spent all morning dealing with the weekly and monthly (a little late) accounts, including moving some money into a savings account. After lunch I produced a revised version of Sam Davis' process flowchart and sent it to her. After an early dinner we went to a Steyning Music Society concert. A Latvian pianist who was remarkable.</p>
        <p>Sunday 18th September</p>
        <p>Dad called this morning to say that his curtain pole had fallen down and he couldn't put it back up. He had come over dizzy trying to do so. So I went over (in the TC since Angela needed the Panda) and fixed it for him. That essentially took most of the morning. After a late lunch I tried sorting out the handouts for the Control Technology workshop. I also ordered a set of bushes for the front springs on the TC.</p>
        <p>Monday 19th September</p>
        <p>The day started by me going to Dad's and Angela going to the church hall. She went to help clear the kitchen before it is refitted. I changed Dad's bed, put on his washing and filled his pill box. He also had problems with his TV. The remote initially would not work, even with new baterries, but then started working! We were both home by lunch time, after which Angela went to her WI meeting and I cut the grass, front and back. Then I paid for the bushes for the TC, after two attempts, and looked at some of the control technology workshop worksheets.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 20th September</p>
        <p>This morning Angela caught the bus to Storrington to take here WI cash to the bank (now that the bank they use has closed in Steyning). Meanwhile I walked to Beeding to have my hair cut. It was the same hairdresser that made a mess of my hair last time! With some more direction it did not turn out too bad. Angela got home fairly early. After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting at Field Place. After the AGM the talk was about modern trams.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 21st September</p>
        <p>Dad had an appointment at the doctor's this morning, so I went over to help him. His dizzy spells seem to be getting better having done his exercises. He doesn't need to do them any more unless teh dizzy spells return. I then spent some time sorting out documents for the IET committee meeting next Tuesday. Later I continued bending (and breaking) wire for the Moth's canbane. I now have two of the six wired made! Later still I finished reading the documents for tomorrow's Gift Oversight Group meeting.</p>
        <p>Thursday 22nd September</p>
        <p>Angela was not too well last night, so rather than going shopping without me this morning, I took the Panda to Brighton for the GoG meeting and we went shopping after lunch. So this morning I firstly called into the STEM Sussex office to pick up the the CoCo discs. Then the GoG meeting in Mithras House, followed by a trip to the Nuts &amp; Bolts shop in Hove to get a new bolt for the near-side damper. The new front spring bushes arrived yesterday, so I now need to schedule the work. After lunch we picked up Dad and went to do the weekly shop. It was quite late by the time Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay. Meanwhile I cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 23rd September</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I spent most of the morning emailing people with regard to STEM events that we have lined up. It was a fine day, so later in the morning I started charging the Cub batteries. Then, later in the afternoon I took the Cub up to the flying site. It was quite windy, but I managed to get the Cub off the ground on the second attempt. After a few circuits, during which I tried to trim the rudder, I tried landing. However, I ended up in the long grass just short of the strip. I thought I would try taking off again, but as it left the ground it vered to the right and hit the ground. The new motor mount broke, as did the propeller, and there is a little damage to the wing. Hopefully the latter will not be a problem.</p>
        <p>Saturday 24th September</p>
        <p>Following our usual walk to Beeding newsagents Angela went in the garden and I did the weekly accounts. Then I moved the TC to the middle of the garage and put it on axle stands. Firstly i removed the odd bolt on the near-side damper, only to find that my new bolt was the wrong size. Since the shop in Hove closes on Saturday afternoon I did a quick run to Portland Road to get the correct bolt (at twice the price). It seems that even though the 3/8&quot; BSW spanner fits the bolt head, it does not mean that it is a 3/8&quot; BSW bolt! It seems that it is a 7/16&quot; BSW bolt. The size is the diameter of the shaft. After a late lunch I put in the new bolt and started dismantling the shackle at the rear of the near-side front spring. It took quite a lot of effort to remove the plates and studs. I still need to remove the old rubber bushes. During the afternoon we spoke with Victoria since yesterday was Juniper's first birthday.</p>
        <p>Sunday 25th September</p>
        <p>While I went off to buy a newspaper, Angela took Philip to church, where they stayed for a harvest lunch. So it was afternoon tea time by the time she got home. When I got back I removed the old rubber bushes from the near-side of the TC, cleaned up all the pieces (and the inside of the tube and spring eye), painted the shackle sides and touched up the chassis. After lunch I removed the off-side front spring shackle and bushes. It came apart more easily than the near-side, but I still needed to paint the shackle plates. Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 26th September</p>
        <p>This morning we went over to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes and fill his pill box. It was nearly lunchtime by the time we got home. This afternoon Hamish came over and we checked all the Control Technology workshop equipment prior to Wednesday's workshop at Lancing College prep school. I then packed everything away ready for Wednesday morning.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 27th September</p>
        <p>This morning while Anglea went to Steyning I started fitting the new bushes to the TC. The off side went quite easily, although I had to screw the bolts on one side of each pin in the vice before fitting the pins and plate, then the other plate and nuts. The near side was more difficult, since the spring seemed to be slightly twisted. Anyway, with a little adjustment of the jack under the axle and one under the end of the spring I got both sides fitted and the nuts painted. After lunch I put on the wheels and took the car off the axle stands. Then I prepared for the IET committee meeting. So later in the afternoon I went to the Hawth in Crawley.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 28th September</p>
        <p>An early start! Hamish arrived at 7:30 and we went off to Hove where we ran a Control Technology workshop. After lunch at the school, Hamish dropped me home just before two o'clock, by which time Anglea had gone to table tennis. During the afternoon I dealt with a lot of e-mail and started writing the minutes of yesterday's IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Thursday 29th September</p>
        <p>Being Thursday we made our way over to Dad's and then took him to Holmebush to do the weeks shopping for us, him, Bay and Philip. We were home a little earlier than usual, so lunch was about the usual time. Afterwards, Angela took Philip's shopping to him while I experimented with CoCo in preparation for tomorrow's workshops. Then I finished drafting the minutes of Tuesday's IET committee meeting before I got a call from Dad to say that his TV wouldn't work! I went over, but could not get it to turn on. So I drove back to Bay's to borrow her small TV, which I then took back to Dad's. We now need to look for a replacement.</p>
        <p>Friday 30th September</p>
        <p>Another early start. Hamish and I were back at Lancing College Prep school to run two control technology workshops, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Both seemed to go well. I got home a little after five o'clock.</p>
