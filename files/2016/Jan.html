        <p>Friday 1st January</p>
        <p>New Year's Day. Firstly I collected Dad and then Bay. They stayed for lunch and then a bite of tea. But they could not stay awake during the showing of videos from Krimpenerwaard! I took them home and got back by a quarter to nine.</p>
        <p>Saturday 2nd January</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning this morning while I rested my foot, having 'filed' a little too much skin off the sole of my left foot. So I spent the morning firstly doing the weekly accounts and the monthly accounts (the last of 2015). After lunch we transferred some Christmas monies into Rowan's, Austin's and Juniper's savings accounts and into Victoria and Brandon's account. I then started compiling a list of materials for the Tiger Moth. Still a long way to go. I also listed out the dates for Big Bang @ events that George sent and put them in my calendar.</p>
        <p>Sunday 3rd January</p>
        <p>It was drizzling this morning, so I went to the Beeding newsagents on my own and, a little later, Angela went to church. Unfortunately it was raining and blowing harder on her return at lunchtime! It continued that way for the rest of the day. I spent most of the rest of the day looking at the Tiger Moth plans and noting what materials are needed to build the fuselage. I also tracked down a likely candidate DH82a as the model for its livery. I did also e-mail the US owner of two new TCs Forever to say that I could buy a new copy in the UK for less. Just before dinner we spoke to both Paul and Victoria ang settled on a weekend to visit Berkenwoude. In the evening Angela started the puzzle that Krista and Paul gave us for Christmas.</p>
        <p>Monday 4th January</p>
        <p>Another day of frequent heavy showers. Angela started with a trip to Steyning, then I went to Dad's to help him with his bed changing and washing. I also changed one of the photos in his frames and made an appointment for him at the optician. Before I left home we stripped the bed and lifted out the matress. I thought that our new matress was being delivered after lunch, but it arrived just before midday, before I got home. After lunch we removed the matress from its two plastic bags and tried the fitted sheets. We need sheets with deeper sides! So Angela ordered some from M&amp;S online, to collect on Thursday. Then I priced the materials from SMC and later priced them from SLEC; &#163;40 from SLEC (including delivery) compared to &#163;50 from SMC. This was due to slightly lower prices for each item and being able to order ones and twos rather than a pack of ten. I also set up a board for the jigsaw and we did a little.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 5th January</p>
        <p>A busy day. While Angela went down to Steyning I researched travel to Rotterdam and worked out the materials required for building the wings of the Tiger Moth. After lunch we booked the flights from Gatwick to Amsterdam, booked the parking and e-mailed the cattery. I then placed my order online for balsa, spruce, obechi, hardwood, plywood and piano wire. I'm not convinced that I got my 10% discount! Later, I went to Crawley for an IET talk on the Watchkeeper UAS. It was good.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 6th January</p>
        <p>This morning we finished taking down the Christmas decorations. I removed the tree lights and the porch lights, took out the tree and put the decorations in the loft. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I put on my new overalls and put the MG up on axle stands. This will allow me to refit the hanbrake cables and to clean the underside. After that, I went to Moulescoomb to a briefing on next-week's First Lego League at Gatwick Airport.</p>
        <p>Thursday 7th January</p>
        <p>Weekly shopping day at Holmebush. After lunch, while Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, I refitted the near-side handbrake cable. I had to adjust the size of the slot in the backplate and the width of the collet/guide, but all seems to work well. I had to change the linked account on Juniper's savings account with RCI (to my 1-2-3 account), since I can only transfer money in and out via that one account. I also installed the FLL scoring app on the iPad.</p>
        <p>Friday 8th January</p>
        <p>The balsa and other types of wood that I ordered from SLEC arrived this morning at about ten o'clock. It all seemed to be there and in good condition. Meanwhile Angela went down to Steyning. Later in the morning I refitted the offside handbrake cable. I discovered that the bolts that hold the cable entry plate to the backplate need to have their head on the inside so as not to foul the brake shoe. So I went back to the near-side and refitted the bolts (which were actually much shorter than those on the off-side). Then I washed the Panda and started cleaning the mud off the chassis of the MG.</p>
        <p>Saturday 9th January</p>
        <p>As usual we walked to the newsagents. I managed to finish cleaning mud off the chassis of the MG, one side during the morning and the other after we had been round to Bay's to collect her garden equipment that she wants to give away. In the evening I stayed up too late, watching a film. I also made a start on documenting the replacement of the handbrake cables.</p>
        <p>Sunday 10th January</p>
        <p>I went alone to the newsagents this morning, since we were late getting up. During the day I managed to clean under the wings and running boards. We also took Bay's garden equipment and some sleeping bags to the 'give it away day' and spoke to both Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 11th January</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went to the opticians and did some shopping in Steyning before we went over to Dad's. We 'turned over' his bed and I showed him some photos from Christmas and a video of Juniper. After lunch we turned our new matress and then I worked on the MG. I put wax under the wings and running boards, adjusted the brakes and 'balanced' the handbrake cables. I also touched up a little paint. After dinner I went to a WSMGOC meeting at Worthing Rugby Club (it only takes 25 minutes to get there). The talk was on the assisination of Frans Joseph, which started the first world war. I also paid for tickets to the Annual Dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 12th January</p>
        <p>This morning I took the MG off its axle stands. Getting the rear down was fine, but after I had removed one of the front stands I had to jack the car up a little so as to clear the other (near-side) stand and the jack slipped off the front axle! The jack must have been too far back on the block of wood under the axle. The car dropped, leaving it with three wheels on the floor and one raised up on the stand. I was able to jack up the front again and remove the final stand. All looks well. I then checked the tyre pressures (on the Panda as well) and started wiping over the bodywork. I just have the running boards, front and rear to clean before applying wax. George arrived just before lunch, delivering some tourch kits and literature. After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting at Field Place. When I got home I e-mailed Colleen at Holy Trinity school and Jenny Oliver, who will help me with the workshop there. I also e-mailed John James about his copy of TCs Forever.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 13th January</p>
        <p>The alarm went off at six o'clock this morning! I then left at 7:40 for Gatwick and the FIRST Lego League regional competition. There were only eight teams and none were very good at building robots to perform the various challenges. I was one of the robot game referees and got home at about half past four. An enjoyable, but exhausting day.</p>
        <p>Thursday 14th January</p>
        <p>We did our M&amp;S shopping before having coffee this morning. Then on to Tesco. Overall, we were home relatively early. After lunch Angela went to Philip's and Bay's while I put wax on the MG. I started it and drove it up and down the road a couple of times to warm the engine. Then I put it over to one side of the garage and tried tightening the jubilee clips on the hoses, before putting the cover on.</p>
        <p>Friday 15th January</p>
        <p>I needed to stay in this morning to wait for the workshop equipment/literature from the IET. So while Angela went to Steyning and to Bay's I reviewed the GOG disbursement requests and sent my approval to Melissa. Then I e-mailed John James and agreed to buy his copy of TCs Forever. The IET packages arrived just after lunch. The case containing the wind farm model was larger than I expected and the sophistication was lower than I had hoped. Afterwards we went to Lyons Farm to get some slippers and a pill box for Bay. We also went to the model shop to buy a cutting mat and some thin CA. We then went to Bay's for a cup of tea. Unfortunately the slippers were too short, even though they were the size she had said. When we got home I generated small versions of the photos I want to use to document the handbrake cable replacement.</p>
        <p>Saturday 16th January</p>
        <p>This morning, after our usual walk to Beeding newsagents, we walked back to Steyning to buy some Seville oranges and some bread rolls for lunch. We then went to the Steyning Centre to look at the exhibition of plots of land that will be included in the Neighborhood Plan as suitable for providing housing over the next 15 years. Although the wood next to us had been proposed, the only recommended plot is the top edge of the field onthe bend of Maudlin Lane, opposite Kingsmead Lodge. After lunch Angela went to a beetle drive at the church hall and I did the weekly accounts and continued to document my handbrake cable replacement work. I completed it after dinner.</p>
        <p>Sunday 17th January</p>
        <p>I walked to the newsagents, in the rain, on my own this morning, then spent most of the rest of the morning reading the paper. I did, however, make a start on modifying the notes for the workshop and sorting out the torch kits and literature. After lunch I e-mailed Jenny. Later we spoke to Paul and then Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 18th January</p>
        <p>This morning I went over to Dad's to help him change his bed and do his washing. I also recorded two short videos of him talking about his youth. After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I spent a lot of time trying to get the two video clips into iMovie and exported as mp4 files. I also laid out the Tiger Moth fuselage plan, covered part of it and pinned the first two pieces (the two spruce longerons) in place.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 19th January</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I waited at home in case my book from John James arrived. It actually arrived after she was back. The book looks very good, so I transferred &#163;96 (&#163;85 + &#163;11pp) into John's account. I also used a new version of the Handbrake app to reduce the size of the video clips that I took of Dad. Then generated a page to include them. However, I have a problem with the new link to this page from the 'family' page. After lunch I went to Portslade Aldridge Community Acadamy to hear about and see their primary STEM bus and observatory. We also saw the proposed site of the bus in the grounds of Mile Oak Primary, just around the corner. I will need to brief George so that we can see if the IET cn help in any way. Later I went to Falmer for a joint IET/IMechE talk on autonomous vehicles. It was very good.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 20th January</p>
        <p>I started the morning writing an e-mail to George about the STEM/Science bus meeting yesterday. Then I went over to Dad's to take him to his optician's appointment. After lunch Angela went to her table tennis and I investigated my difficulty with a link that doesn't work on a web page, eventually e-mailing Paul. He replied that it worked for him on Chrome! Then I firstly removed the synch on Google Drive and Dropbox, only to find that I then did not have visibility of the folders/files in Finder. So I reset the synch! I also did a little (very little) to the Tiger Moth and updated both the Windows OS and Linux. Then I read a little about upgrading to Windows 10. I had intended practicing on the flight simulator, but the batteries in the transmitter werre flat, so I put them on charge.</p>
        <p>Thursday 21st January</p>
        <p>An early alarm call this morning. However, I had been waking regularly during the night and had woken at 5:30, so was ready for the alarm at six! Jenny Oliver (who, it transpired, is the daughter-in-law of Steve Oliver from the SRFC and RCEA) arrived at 7:30 and we loaded up her large Mercedes estate. We went to Holy Trinity School in Crawley and ran five, one-hour workshops. Jenny did the torch making and I did the find farm, swapping groups half way through. It was a tiring, but interesting day. I got home at 4:15, had a cup of tea and then resolved the problem with my 'family' web page.</p>
        <p>Friday 22nd January</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning, I went for a haircut in Beeding and then walked to Steyning to get a plug o-ring and chain for the bathroom. It rained all the way! Even though I was wearing waterproof trousers, I got pretty wet. After lunch tried to repair the dual boot on the laptop. I have to break into the boot process and select the option to start ReFind, otherwise it boots straight into Windows. I had to use a live DVD to install boot-repair, but it made no difference! Then I showered, updated software on the iMac, Linux and Windows systems and then upgraded Windows to Windows 10. All seems to be well.</p>
        <p>Saturday 23rd January</p>
        <p>Following our usual Saturday walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper I did the weekly accounts while Angela made soup. I also updated Scratch on each of three systems (OS X, Linux and Windows 10) and checked that the flight simulator worked with the transmitter on the new Windows installation. After lunch Angela went into the garden, mainly to cut down raspberry canes, while I cut and pinned more uprights and diagonals to the first side of the Tiger Moth. It takes a lot longer than I thought to cut the hardwood dowel and make it fit properly. When Angela came in for a cup of tea we then spent quite a lot of time working on the jigsaw.</p>
        <p>Sunday 24th January</p>
        <p>The walk to the newsagents was dry this morning. I then spent most of the morning writing a case study for STEM Sussex. I managed to complete the parts for the the first side of the Moth and glued them together. Then I started shaping the ply on the front side. Angela went to church while I did these things and then she went into the greenhouse to plant sweet pea seeds. We also spoke to Paul, just before they were due to go out, and then we spoke to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 25th January</p>
        <p>Angela went down to Steyning while I finished my shower and dealt with some e-mail. Then we went to Dad's to 'turn over' his bed, top up his pill box and show him some photos. I also looked in his loft and found some papers relating to sale and purchase of houses, but not his house deeds. He insists they were in a roll that was too big to fit in Alan's sage and so he put them in his loft, next to the safe. After lunch Angela cut up the oranges that she had cooked yesterday before we went to Bay's to sort out her house insurance and do one or two jobs. When we got home, Angela made more marmalade. I did a very small amount to the Moth and startedcollecting images for a talk on process automation for the RCEA.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 26th January</p>
        <p>I started by downloading some process automation related images. Later in the morning I took Dad to his optician to pick up his new glasses. We also bought him some mouse traps, which I set either side of his fire. After lunch, and some time spent on the jigsaw, I did some more work on finding images for a talk for the RCEA, before going to an IET Sussex Local Network committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 27th January</p>
        <p>I sorted out the boxes of stuff that we need for tomorrow's Mini Big Bang and mailed George about the quantity and size. Then I completed the first side of the Tiger Month and took a photo for the blog. I then spent the rest of the day writing up the minutes of yesterday's meeting. During the afternoon, Angela went to table tennis.</p>
        <p>Thursday 28th January</p>
        <p>Up at six o'clock again this morning (after a poor night's sleep) so as to be ready to be picked up by George at 6:30. We then set off to Hastings for a careers fair run by the Hastings Chamber of Commerce at the Brighton University buildings. The event finished at 12:30, so we packed up our gear, had some lunch and got home by three. I then completed the minutes of Tuesday's IET committee meeting and e-mailed Derek and Laurence re some of my actions. </p>
        <p>Friday 29th January</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning, I worked out and documented the process of dealing with the video clip that I took of Dad. I converted the clip that I had taken on Monday and put it on the web site, but it took most of the morning. After lunch I decided to look at the proposal to use a slideshow at the start of IET lectures. It took quite a while to find a way to build an html file that would produce a slideshow of images. A presentation produced in Keynote can be exported as an html file, which includes a .png file for each slide. The html page needs the user to click so as to move to the next slide, but the images can be used with my html animation. I then started producing the actual slides for a trial. I had intended doing some modelling, but did not get around to it.</p>
        <p>Saturday 30th January</p>
        <p>No modelling today either! By the time that we had walked to the newsagents in Beeding and then read some of the paper, I only had time before lunch to finish my IET slideshow and send it to Hamish for his comments. Afteer lunch Angela went in the garden and I downloaded the latest files for Barefoot. Since the presentation is in PowerPoint (and a pptx file at that) I could not open it with Keynote. However, I managed to open it in Open Office under Linux and to produce a pdf file containing the notes pages. There are 65 slides in all, 51 of which are for the workshop! I printed these notes pages and put them in my Barefoot folder. Finally I did the weekly accounts and we transferred some money from our current account into one of our savings accounts.</p>
        <p>Sunday 31st January</p>
        <p>I only managed a little modelling today. After a walk to the newsagents (and a read of some of yesterday's paper) I cut a few pieces of spruce. After lunch I expected to spend a little while looking at the Barefoot presentation notes, but I found that the notes font was too large and quite a few lines were not printed. So I hand wrote the missed words, which took the whole afternoon apart from the time that we spoke to Paul and Victoria. While we were dishing up dinner, Bay phoned to ask that Angela go round. She went after we had eaten, only to find that Bay felt better!</p>
