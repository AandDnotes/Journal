        <h1>Sunday 12th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I continued fixing the Tapley boxes to the sitting room wall. We made a start putting a few things in and on them and moving some furniture around.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela did some more work in the garden and then we spoke with Rowan and Paul. They had been to a newly opened adventure playground.</p>
