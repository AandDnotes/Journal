        <h1>Saturday 4th May</h1>
        <p>We spent most of the day at the Craft Fair being held at the Methodist Church. Angela went first to start helping with the preparation of lunches and then I went, via the newsagents, to sell lunch tickets. There was quite a good flow of people.</p>
        <p>I was home first and found a message from Victoria to say that they were going out, both before and after lunch. I started the process of installing the washing machine and found that the water inlet pipe is too short! So I will try to buy a longer one int he morning. When Angela got back we noticed that Paul had posted a photo, so we asked if they were available for a chat. They were, so we talked with them for a while and gave them a video tour of the house.</p>
        <p>After tea we tried to do our Dutch lessons, but had trouble connecting to the server. Things got worse and I re-booted the router. After a while the ADSL line started working, although the speed is still relatively low. I will need to try connecting it to the main telephone socket.</p>
