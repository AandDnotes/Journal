        <h1>Monday 6th May</h1>
        <p>Early Spring Bank Holiday. So today was the second day of the Craft Fair, held at the Methodist Church. Once again, Angela helped prepare lunches and I sold lunch (and desert) tickets.</p>
        <p>I left Angela to help clear up and went to visit Dad. It seems that he had not felt well this morning, but seemed to have improved.</p>
        <p>When I got home I drafted the May newsletter. THis was more difficult than usual since a new template, with the new branding, had been loaded, but not as a file to load in the usual way. It does not seem to place a name from the database after 'Dear'!</p>
