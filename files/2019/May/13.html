        <h1>Monday 13th May</h1>
        <p>Angela set off early to help with the lunch club and then went to a WI committee meeting, while I spent a good part of the day taking Dad to Southlands outpatients. He had a cystoscopy, but the doctor could not find anything that had caused the blood in his urine. However, she said that he has residual urine, probably due to weak muscles around the bladder, which likely cause the infections. He could have had a catheter installed, but between us we decided to see how things go. She has sent a letter to his GP. He was very tired when we got back to Victoria Grand, but they had saved lunch for him. I was home by about 2:30.</p>
        <p>Before going out I dealt with some IET and Barefoot emails and when I got home updated a couple of addresses. Then I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington. It was just a natter. Meanwhile Angela emptied more boxes.</p>
