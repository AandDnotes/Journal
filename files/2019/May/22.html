        <h1>Wednesday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI group I spent most of the morning rewiring an extension power lead (I found one that is screwed together) and fitting channeling up to the telephone, router and AirPort. However, I hadn't tested the lead and found that the end two sockets would not provide power. So I will need to take out the cord, dismantle the unit and try to make it work.</p>
        <p>During the morning we had a call from Angela Payne to say that she hoped to exchange contracts on Rosemary Avenue this week and complete on May 30th.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Rosemary Avenue to collect the petrol mower and the push mower. Then I went off to STEM Sussex to get my ID checked for my DBS renewal and then went on to Sussex University for the final talk of the season. It was good, but poorly attended. I had forgotten to give the speaker an expenses form, so sent him one when I got home.</p>
