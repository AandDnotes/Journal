        <h1>Friday 10th May</h1>
        <p>Today was supposed to be about putting boxes on the sitting room wall. However, I was planning to go to Lyons Farm to get some bigger wall plugs and screws, then Angela found that Argos had the compost bin she wanted. Then Victoria Grand phoned to say that Dad was 'leaking' during the night and was quite upset about it. So they wanted to try incontinence pants and wanted us to get some. After fitting the washing line spike (which was easier than expected) and hanging out the washing, we went to B&amp;Q, then to Boots and finally to Argos before going to Victoria Grand. We got there just as Dad was going down for lunch, so we just left the pants. Consequently we only got home just before lunchtime.</p>
        <p>When we tried to assemble the compost bin we found that half the top was missing! So Angela took it back to Argos and exchanged it for a complete one, then worked in the garden. Meanwhile I fitted the top row of batons. I had to drill out the plugs so as to get the screws in (which were the largest size for the plugs). So that is one third of the total!</p>
