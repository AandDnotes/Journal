        <h1>Friday 24th May</h1>
        <p>More jobs around the house on another fine, sunny day. Angela went to a funeral and then worked on curtains for the bedroom, while I re-routed the speaker cables. I also fixed the arial, but reception of Radio Sussex is very poor.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Wenban-Smith and bought some plywood, cut to size, for shelving in the study. It was expensive, but is good quality and at least the long cuts are very neat. After that I vacuumed the carpet in the loft and put various things up there.</p>
