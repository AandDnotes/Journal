        <h1>Friday 17th May</h1>
        <p>Angela was looking forward to today, having an opportunity to go shopping on her own. She took me to Shoreham station so that I caught the 09:43 train to Victoria. From there I went to Savoy Place for lunch before going to the HUBSEE steering group meeting. Then back to Savoy Place for a while before returning to Victoria. Angela picked me up just after 8:30.</p>
        <p>Apart from Helen Ward there were only six attendees. Again it was very much Helen telling us what she had done/is doing and defending any criticism/comment.</p>
