        <h1>Wednesday 8th May</h1>
        <p>The rain started during the night and was still falling when we left for the Wanderers run. However, we took the Panda due to the rain. From use of the word 'we' you will realise that Angela came on this run. We met the other members at Denmans Gardens at Fontwell. There were a few MGs. We then followed the route of about 30 miles to the Chichester Sailing Club, where we had lunch. By this time the rain had stopped and the sun was shining!</p>
        <p>We called into a couple of garden centres on the way home, looking at water butts and compost bins. We were home at about four o'clock. I looked at the Octopus site and found that they do not have our new address, even though I've told them. So I sent them an email. I also renewed the TC's road tax and put both car's registration documents in an envelope to inform the DVLA of our change of address. Later I emailed Colin Forsyth about his talk on space weather.</p>
