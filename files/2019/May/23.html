        <h1>Thursday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>We had a busy day today. On our way to Victoria Grand we took a number of items to the tip at Broadwater. After visiting Dad we went into Worthing to do a number of things, including buying a new bed for the spare room. We chose one known as an ottoman bed. You lift one end of the mattress and open up two large storage boxes. The shop was having a 'refurbishment' sale. So we were able to buy a bed from the shop floor at a reduced price and with a delivery of only 7 to 10 days.</p>
        <p>We went on to Lyons Farm to do the weekly grocery shop and also buy some compost and hanging basket brackets. We had also bought a manger basket for the garden wall and a longer cable to connect the router to the phone line.</p>
        <p>So after a late lunch (it was after three o'clock before we finished) I fitted the new cable and repaired the power extension so that I could tidy the cables into the channeling. I also opened the patio door and tried to clean the 'track'. It really needs the door removing from the track and cleaning/lubricating.</p>
