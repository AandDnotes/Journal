        <h1>Saturday 18th May</h1>
        <p>A tiring day. I dropped Angela in Steyning on my way to Crawley for STEM in the Park, arriving there at 9:30. As I was unloading the car so Wil Robards arrived, followed by Manja da Silva. In spite of the event being smaller than last year, we had a lot of visitors and got through a lot of torch kits. I arrived home just after five, having taken my lunch and eaten it on a bench in the Memorial Gardens. While I was out, Angela sorted a lot of boxes in the spare bedroom.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke briefly with Victoria. They (excluding Brandon) had spent the night in a tent with the cub scouts.</p>
