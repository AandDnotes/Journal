        <h1>Sunday 26th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I spent a lot of the morning doing the weekly accounts. We have spent quite a lot this week and I had the bank statement to reconcile. I also made some measurements of the bathroom for our next visit to the bath shop and sent a couple of IET related email.</p>
        <p>Most of the afternoon was spent removing the panel on the side of the dishwasher space in the kitchen. I just need to cut off a piece of the plinth. In the middle we spoke to Paul and Rowan. Still no sign of a foal. Angela continued working on the bedroom curtains.</p>
