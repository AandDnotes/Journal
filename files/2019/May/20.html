        <h1>Monday 20th May</h1>
        <p>After a fairly short visit to Victoria Grand I completed my STEM Ambassador registration, ready for an ID check on Wednesday. After an early lunch Angela went to he WI meeting (followed by a committee meeting) and I went to Horsham to run a Barefoot workshop. It seemed fo go well, even though there were only half the number of staff.</p>
        <p>Later I changed our address on the electoral register.</p>
