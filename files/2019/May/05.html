        <h1>Sunday 5th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I drove to Currys to get aa long water hose for the washing machine. I then discovered that the wast hose would not reach either! So I spent the most of the day cutting holes in the sink cupboard and plumbing in the washing machine.</p>
        <p>Angela had a meeting after lunch, but when she got home we spoke with Victoria and had a late diner.</p>
