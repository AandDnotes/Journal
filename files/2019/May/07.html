        <h1>Tuesday 7th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I fixed the slight weep in the washing machine supply pipe (I had over-tightened it) before completing the draft of the May newsletter. Then I cut the grass. I used the electric mower left by the previous owners and had less than one hopper of grass.</p>
        <p>After lunch (we had our main meal at lunch time) I designed the layout of of the Tapley boxes (while Angela went to the library) before going to Bernard's to get a lift to the IET committee meeting in Crawley. He used his Nissan Leaf.</p>
