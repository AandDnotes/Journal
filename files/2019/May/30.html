        <h1>Thursday 30th May</h1>
        <p>Since we saw Dad yesterday we didn't need to go to Victoria Grand today. So we decided to head in the Shoreham direction, starting with a visit to the tip, then Lidl (for Angela to look at plants) and Screwfix (for me to get an adaptor for the waste/dishwasher and wall lights). We then went to Next (to look at lamp shades), M&S (for coffee and to buy a plant pot) and then Tesco for the groceries shop. On the way back we called into Gardener & Scardifield electrical shop in Lancing to look at lights and were home just after one.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela put in some of the plants she had bought and I fixed the the plane brackets to the study wall. The Cub and glider are now off the floor.</p>
