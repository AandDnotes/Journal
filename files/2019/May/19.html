        <h1>Sunday 19th May</h1>
        <p>It has been a day of small jobs. While Angela was at church I did the weekly accounts and then fitted the 'lorry' shelves to the study wall. I put two of the screws into a stud and the other two simply into the plasterboard. I then managed to empty one of the study boxes, partly into the shelves and partly into other boxes.</p>
        <p>Angela used the electric mower to cut the grass. She also did more weeding and we spoke with Paul. Rowan wanted to go outside to look for ladybirds, so refused to come to the computer to talk to us.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I removed the grab-handles at the front, put up the hall mirror and moved/hung a couple of pictures.</p>
