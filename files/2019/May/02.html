        <h1>Thursday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>Today we had to get back into the routine of normal (retired) life. Firstly we went to visit Dad, then went into Worthing to pay in the cheque from the sale of our house (less the purchase and the expenses) and finally did the weekly groceries shop at Sainsbury's. We were home for a late lunch.</p>
        <p>We called on our next-door neighbour, Lynne, and sat in her garden for a short while. We then emptied more boxes. I also connected the FreeSat box to the dish and it worked! I still haven't worked out why there are three cables coming into the sitting room from the dish.</p>
