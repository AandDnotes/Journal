        <h1>Tuesday 21st May</h1>
        <p>Apart from Angela's visit to the dentist it was a good day. It was warm and sunny, so we sat in the 'back' garden for coffee and then while Angela was out, I prepared the TC for an outing, which meant uncovering it and removing all the plane parts and balsa/plan bundles from inside. When she got back we drove to Storrington so that she could bank her WI cash and then went on to Amberley, to the Sportsman Inn, for lunch. There is a fine view from their deck and conservatory. We got home just before three, having driven the TC 50 miles.</p>
        <p>It was still very warm, so Angela did some more work in the garden and I researched materials for shelving in the study. I then looked in the loft and was surprised to find that, as well as being completely boarded, it is carpeted! There are even power points up there, so I can vacuum the carpet before we put things up there.</p>
