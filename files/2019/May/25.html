        <h1>Saturday 25th May</h1>
        <p>We thought it might be worthwhile calling into a bathroom shop to look at some options. We spent over an hour there, changed our ideas completely and brought back some brochures. It is going to be expensive!</p>
        <p>We then called into Dunelm Mill to have a coffee and buy a laundry basket. However, we came away with a suitcase, a fitted sheet and a cake stand for Kate. Then it was on to Lidle, for some plants, and Screwfix for brackets and screws. So quite a long morning.</p>
        <p>After a latish lunch I put the manger basket on the wall, fitted two new hanging basket brackets and removed two old brackets. Angela dis some gardening and continued working on the bedroom curtains. We also spoke with Victoria eta al.</p>
