        <h1>Thursday 9th May</h1>
        <p>Angela was helping to run a WI coffee morning this morning, so we had to postpone our visit to Victoria Grand and to the supermarket until this afternoon. While Angela was out, I made corrections to my 'teak box' diagram and calculated the positions of the items on the wall. In the end I only managed to get the holes for two batons marked!</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we firstly went into Worthing (parking at the station and walking in) so that Angela could pay her WI cash into the bank. They made Â£50.05. We then went on to visit Dad. The doctor had ben to see him since he had indigestion type pains. The doctor has put him back on stomach-calming pills (we didn't know that he had been taken off them). We reviewed his 'future care' plan and showed him photos of Rowan opening her birthday presents.</p>
        <p>Then we did the weekly groceries shop. We also bought some things in B&amp;Q and picked up an Argos catalogue. So it wasn't far short of dinner time when we got home. While Angela cooked, I fixed the key hooks to the wall in the kitchen. I also discovered that the wall plugs I have are not as large as I thought. I will need to get some bigger ones for the heavy Tapley boxes. Another trip to B&amp;Q!</p>
