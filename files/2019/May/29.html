        <h1>Wednesday 29th May</h1>
        <p>Today was all about hospital appointments. Dad had an appointment at Southlands Dermatology at 10:45 and Angela had one at Worthing Hearing at 10:30. So I dropped Angela in Worthing (near Stein Gardens), then collected Dad and took him to Shoreham. We were early and Dr Ali was running late. Nevertheless we were out by eleven o'clock. Dad is now discharged from the hospital, but can get a prompt appointment if necessary.</p>
        <p>The battery of Angela's mobile was flat, so we arranged to meet in Morrisons. She had not been there long when I arrived. Her hearing is the same as last year.</p>
        <p>After lunch the man from the movers called to collect the empty boxes. Angela continued working on the bedroom curtains and I finished making brackets/hooks for the planes. I now just need to fit them to the study wall.</p>
        <p>After dinner I phoned Alan to give him an update.</p>
