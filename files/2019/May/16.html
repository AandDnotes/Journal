        <h1>Thursday 16th May</h1>
        <p>I had been invited by Bronagh Liddicoat of STEM Sussex to attend a meeting in Crawley with the Three Bridges Forum. I couldn't find anyone else who could attend, so we made an early start to B&amp;Q and Boots before going to Victoria Grand. We got home just in time for me to drive to Crawley College. Two people from TBF, Bronagh and I sat in the restaurant and discussed how we might be able to collaborate. TBF were there because they were staging their exhibit at the student project exhibition. Bronagh was also going, so I had a quick look. I was quite impressed with what they had done.</p>
        <p>It was nearly four o'clock by the time I got home to have lunch! I then paid Dad's paper bill and transferred money into Rowan's and Austin's accounts. I also changed some more addresses before looking at changing the cable on an extension lead. But they are 'tamper' proof!</p>
        <p>Ramon delivered the rest of the equipment for Saturday's STEM event in Crawley.</p>
