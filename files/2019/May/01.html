        <h1>Wednesday 1st May</h1>
        <p>We spent the day unpacking boxes. We started by trying out the show 'under the stairs'. It works quite well, although the shower head seems blocked, probably by scale. Then Angela went to the High Street (we now actually live in Steyning) to get something for lunch and I fixed the bookcase to the wall and emptied some boxes of books.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I went to Brighton for the 'egg race'. It was a good event. Meanwhile, Angela went to the Steyning Centre to see the film Bohemian Rhapsody. When I got home (just before nine) we had a connected land line. So I set up our wi-fi and did a first pass of my email.</p>
