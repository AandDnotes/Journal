        <h1>Monday 27th May</h1>
        <p>Spring Bank Holiday and a fine, but breezy day. We started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand and then called into B&Q on the way home. For some reason the traffic was chaotic around Lyons Farm. All we wanted was some neoprene tubing and some water retention granuals!</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela went down to the Steyning centre to help with the 'teas' as part of the Steyning Spring Fair. I emptied the box of paper in the garage and started experimenting with making a 'wing bracket' from some wire that was in the garage when we arrived. Then I walked down to the fair and had a cup of tea at the Steyning Centre. Angela was washing up!</p>
        <p>When I got home I finished making four 'brackets' before dinner.</p>
