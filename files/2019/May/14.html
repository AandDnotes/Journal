        <h1>Tuesday 14th May</h1>
        <p>This morning we took the petrol mower to Rosemary Avenue, but I couldn't get it started. So I came back for the electric mower. So most of the morning was spent cutting the grass there. After lunch I cleaned the contacts on all the connectors of the telephone and broadband line, but it doesn't look as though it has made any improvement. The 'internet' light is flashing every few seconds.</p>
        <p>Angela did a lot of washing and a lot of unpacking, while I dealt with IET and STEM related things. Later I went to Crawley to a very good talk on robotic farming. Meanwhile Angela did all the ironing!</p>
