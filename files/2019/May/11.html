        <h1>Saturday 11th May</h1>
        <p>Another day intended for fixing Tapley boxes to the sitting room wall. However, the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and moving Â£100K from our current account into savings accounts (including opening a new one). Meanwhile, Angela went to the High Street to get a newspaper and worked in the garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started work on the boxes and managed to fix three more, actually two shelves and a the drinks cabinet. In the middle we had a short chat with Austin on his birthday. I also started tidying the cables behind the TV.</p>
