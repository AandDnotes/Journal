        <h1>Wednesday 15th May</h1>
        <p>It was a fine, sunny day and Angela went off walking with her WI group. I started by cutting down the cutlery holder and fixed it into the draw. Then I fitted the wall mirror in the bedroom.</p>
        <p>After lunch I removed some speaker cable trunking from the dining room and cut a length for the sitting room, but it is not big enough to take the power cable. So I need to find some thinner cable or get some deeper trunking. However, I did take the opportunity to remove the pieces of speaker cable that were in each corner of the sitting room and also in the dining room. Angela did some more unpacking.</p>
