        <h1>Friday 31st May</h1>
        <p>We were basically at home today, although Angela walked down to the butchers. I spent most of the morning checking the TC. Just the usual, oil, water, plugs, distributor, but also I removed the top of the steering box to check that it was still full of oil. It was.</p>
        <p>Angela did a lot more work in the garden(s) and I started putting up shelves in the study. Initially I tried just screwing into plugs in the plasterboard, but since the brackets have no back, the plugs just pulled out, with the surface plaster! So I fitted one shelf (above the computer table) by screwing the two brackets into the studs, even though they are not positioned where I would like to put the brackets. The shelf around the corner will need to be higher since the centre stud does not go all the way down.</p>
