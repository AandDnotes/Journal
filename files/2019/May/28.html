        <h1>Tuesday 28th May</h1>
        <p>The first part of the morning was not very successful. We went to Dunelm Mill to buy a laundry basket and some net curtain. They didn't have either. Then we went to Lidle to look for some perenial plants, but they had none. So we went back across Norfolk Bridge to the bath shop, straight into a traffic jam! However, we spent about an hour and a half talking through our requirements and options. We now wait for an outline design and cost (for the bits).</p>
        <p>After a late lunch we moved the dishwasher from the garage into the kitchen. While Angela went to check on Rosemary Avenue (the solicitor still hasn't heard from the buyer's solicitor) I fitted the dishwasher in the widened space. Unfortunately the waste hose is narrower than the connector on the sink trap! So I need to find a new connector.</p>
        <p>I phoned British Gas about our HomeCare account, only to find that the direct debit had been stopped after the March payment, i.e. when the new boiler was fitted. So our account was cancelled and I emailed Ben, asking him to pass on details to the Baxters of how they can take over the account.</p>
