        <h1>Saturday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>After a reasonable night's sleep we pottered in the garden while Paul and Krista dealt with the ponies. We then all went to Delft, about a 40 minute drive. Paul had pre-booked a parking ticket and we were able to park just a short walk from the centre. Delft is a typical Dutch town, with old, tall buildings criss-crossed with canals, a large central square and multiple churches. We had lunch in a converted warehouse and then, shortly after, stopped for coffee and cake in a backstreet cafe. The weather was grey and not very warm, so we were back in Berkenwoude by four.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Victoria et al. They are on Summer time and we are an hour ahead of the UK, so we caught them at breakfast-time as usual. We then had some tea and played a 'drawing' game until it was Rowan's bedtime. It was my turn to read some of Harry Potter!</p>
