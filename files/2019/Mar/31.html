        <h1>Sunday 31st March</h1>
        <p>A quieter day today and much cooler. While Angela went to church I did the weekly updates and backups and then ran through the Barefoot slides. I also started clearing the bench in the garage, which I finished later.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. I also discovered that Greg had received confirmation of our meeting at Crawley football club at 11 tomorrow morning. So we need to visit Victoria Grand in the morning earlier than usual.</p>
