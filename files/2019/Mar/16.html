        <h1>Saturday 16th March</h1>
        <p>Our walk to Beeding this morning to buy a newspaper was fine going, when the wind was at our back, but hard work on our return. It remained blustery for most of the day, usually with a little drizzle in the wind. before lunch we took the car to Rosemary Avenue to collect a few things that we do not want to go to St Barnabas on Wednesday. We couldn't get the wheelchair in the car, so will need to return for that.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did the weekly accounts, including a reconciliation against the bank statement. I'd only just finished that when Victoria called. We'd forgotten that they had moved on to daylight saving time last week, so were an hour earlier than we had expected. Austin and Juniper were more interested in watching Sarah &amp: Duck than talking to us. Afterwards, while Angela cooked dinner, I went into the garage and dismantled the steel shelving that I had moved for the installation of the new boiler. It will go to the tip along with other 'rubish'.</p>
