        <h1>Friday 8th March</h1>
        <p>The boiler started this morning, so we cancelled the British Gas visit. In fact it has stayed working all day.</p>
        <p>We had a quick shower, just in case the boiler stopped again. Then I went off to Mike's to finish painting the inside of the light tunnels. I was back for lunch and then, while Angela went to Steyning and Rosemary Avenue, I made a jig to help solder LEDs to pieces of bent wire. I soldered two LEDs, but the third went wrong and is probably un-salvagable.</p>
        <p>We then went to the Methodist church for a quiz night and fish &amp; chip supper. We didn't do very well.</p>
