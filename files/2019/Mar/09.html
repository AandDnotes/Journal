        <h1>Saturday 9th March</h1>
        <p>Once again our boiler would not keep running. So while Angela went fo a paper, I booked British Gas to come some time tomorrow. I did some soldering of LEDs and then we went to the WSMGOC Annual Dinner at the Tollgate. It was a calm evening, so we walked.</p>
