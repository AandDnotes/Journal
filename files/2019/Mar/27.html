        <h1>Wednesday 27th March</h1>
        <p>We are in a calm period of weather at the moment, at least until the weekend. So it was dry, bright-ish and reasonably warm. With a slight wind it meant that the grass was dry enough to cut. I cut the front grass before lunch and the rear grass later in the day.</p>
        <p>In between I read the survey report that the Baxters had commissioned. They have arranged for a survey of the drains, since the surveyor thinks they are blocked. But he was looking down the old drains! So I wrote a note to Ben and will send him comments on the other recommendations tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went to Steyning this morning and to table tennis this afternoon.</p>
