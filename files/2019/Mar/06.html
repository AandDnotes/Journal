        <h1>Wednesday 6th March</h1>
        <p>I spent most of the day at Mike Wooldridge's house, mainly in his workshop, painting the inside of 15 pieces of trunking with blackboard paint. As I did the last one Mike pointed out that I needed to do under the top edges as well! Mike's wife, Chris, gave me lunch. As usual, Angela went to table tennis after her lunch.</p>
        <p>We had a relatively early dinner and then walked down to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Kings of Thieves'. It was very entertaining.</p>
