        <h1>Wednesday 20th March</h1>
        <p>The Spring Equinox, so the first day of Spring! Actually it was not a bad day. It was calm, stayed dry and was reasonably warm with the (very) occasional burst of sunshine. Which was good because Rosemary Avenue was cleared today by two guys from St Barnabas. They arrived just before ten and finished just before two. We only had to retrieve a few things from their van! Now we need to do a good clean through.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela went to a meeting about providing food in the Steyning Centre during the Spring Fayre. Meanwhile I emptied the car and bled the hall radiator, then wrote some notes on last night's meeting and sent them to Sathish. I also found and downloaded the manual for the IET's projector that is overheating, but it isn't obvious how to get it apart.</p>
