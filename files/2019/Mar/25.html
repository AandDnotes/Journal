        <h1>Monday 25th March</h1>
        <p>It was very windy during the night and stayed so for much of the day. Overnight we also had some heavy showers, but it stayed mainly dry during the day. Overall it was a quieter day. We stayed mainly indoors, venturing out only to collect Rowan from school at lunch time and later in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Paul and I installed some new light fittings on the top floor and he fixed the brake cable on Krista's bike. Otherwise they dealt with the ponies. During the afternoon, Greet and Wim came to clean their caravan before they try to sell it. They stayed for coffee and cake.</p>
