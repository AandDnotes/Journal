        <h1>Sunday 10th March</h1>
        <p>We were up early, but the gas man didn't arrive until after lunch. He decided that the pump needed replacing, but having done that, he said that the heat exchanger is blocked and that they are no longer available. He did not think that we should use the boiler and arranged for BG to give us a quote on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>While waiting for the gas man and while Angela was at church, I finished soldering the LEDs for the light tunnels. Later in the day we spoke with Rowan, Paul and Krista.</p>
