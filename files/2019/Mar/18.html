        <h1>Monday 18th March</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Monday morning we started by driving to Victoria Grand. One of the carers brought Dad in 600 ml of water for him to drink before one o'clock. He is now using the lift to go down for lunch and there is still no sign of his bag.</p>
        <p>We were home fairly early so I had time to work my way around the cold water storage tank in the loft to replace the washer in the ball valve. The overflow from the tank has been running for a few days whenever we don't run hot water. Hopefully it is now fixed.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her WI meeting and I cleaned the gutters. I also played with the 'grid' form of web page structure. When she got home, Angela totted up her cash, ready for banking tomorrow.</p>
