        <h1>Monday 18th March</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Monday morning we started by driving to Victoria Grand. One of the carers brought Dad in 600 ml of water for him to drink before one o'clock. He is now using the lift to go down for lunch and there is still no sign of his bag.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her WI meeting and I cleaned the gutters. I also played with the 'grid' form of web page structure. When she got home, Angela totted up her cash, ready for banking tomorrow.</p>
