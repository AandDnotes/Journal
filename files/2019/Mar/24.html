        <h1>Sunday 24th March</h1>
        <p>After Paul and Krista had done their morning chores, with animals, etc. we all went off to a nature reserve for a walk, including Flo. She couldn't be let off her lead, but seemed to enjoy it. On the way back we stopped at a DIY store for some light bulbs, for tomorrow's job.</p>
        <p>It was fine, but a little on the chilly side. However, after a late lunch the sun was quite warm and Angela planted some pansies, with the help of Rowan and I helped with a few odd jobs. We brought Pippin and then Freda down to the garden to munch on the grass, since they really only get hay. The rabbits were also put outside for a while.</p>
        <p>After a roast dinner Paul, Krista dn Rowan went out in the gloom to scatter grass seed on part of the paddock that is cordoned off.</p>
        <p>This morning I checked my test newsletter for April and sent a copy for review to Bernard. Later in the day, after his reply, I scheduled the newsletter for distribution and submitted it for approval.</p>
