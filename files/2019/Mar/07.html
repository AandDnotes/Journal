        <h1>Thursday 7th March</h1>
        <p>We were quite early setting off for Victoria Grand to see Dad. He is still without a 'bag' and Julie says he is progressing well. We went on to Holmebush since we had a petrol voucher and Angela wanted to buy things for the lunch club. So It took us a little longer, particularly since we had coffee first.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we discovered that the boiler had stopped working, so we booked British Gas (under our Homecare contract) to come tomorrow. That is another Â£60 excess! I had another play with my revised 'outings' web pages and looked a little further at the Barefoot presentation.</p>
