        <h1>Sunday 17th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I drove to Mike's to help with the light tunnels. I dismantled the old solar cell boxes and started mounting the cells on Mike's metalwork. So we had two and a half hours work and will continue on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Paul et al. It seems that Rowan's swimming lesson is later in the day on Friday. So we didn't need to book the very early flight!</p>
