        <h1>Saturday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>We started by taking more books down to the Oxfam shop and then bought a paper. On the way back we went via Penlands Vale, mainly for Angela to deliver some notes to someone in one of the other roads. Number 31 looked smaller than I remembered!</p>
        <p>After a short read of the paper we walked down to the Methodist church for the St Barnabas cottage pie lunch. It was quite late by the time that we got home, but I did the weekly accounts before we spoke with Victoria et al.</p>
