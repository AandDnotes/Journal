        <h1>Wednesday 13th March</h1>
        <p>Luckily, although quite windy, it was dry with occasional sunny spells. So before Angela went to Steyning I contacted the British Gas man who called yesterday to give us a quote for a new boiler. It turned out that their system did not have my email address, so I hadn't received the one so as to accept the quote. That was soon rectified and I paid the deposit and booked the delivery/installation for Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Just before lunch I Moved the Panda into the road and took the TC to Dial Post to meet the Sussex Wanderers for lunch. It was a good gathering and the weather stayed fine. I got home at three o'clock. Meanwhile, Angela went to table tennis. On my return I put the TC in the middle of the garage so that I have room to clear the area around the boiler.</p>
