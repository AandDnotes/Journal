        <h1>Saturday 30th March</h1>
        <p>Today was Paul's 40th birthday and, at least here, it was like a summer's day with sunshine from dawn to dusk. However, we really only did three things today. We started by taking a car load of stuff to the Shoreham tip and then went to Rosemary Avenue to finish cutting the grass and to do a little cleaning of cupboards and window sills.</p>
        <p>Then, apart from putting the cover over the TC, we spoke with Victoria et al. It was the end of their school spring break and Austin had been to a Lego club each morning. Before dinner I did manage to do a little more of the conversion of my 'outings' web pages to the grid-based version.</p>
