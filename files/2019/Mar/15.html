        <h1>Friday 15th March</h1>
        <p>Quite a momentus day. We are warm! The boiler and other equipment was delivered before eight o'clock and the installers arrived by 8:30. The two each had their own Transit van and then a third arrived. It seems that one of them had to go to a meeting later in the morning, so the third was to replace him. Then an electrician arrived. By lunchtime the old boiler was out and then new one installed. During that time the system was flushed through, radiator by radiator. The flue has been put very neatly through the soffit at the back and a condensate pipe run through the wall and into a soak-away.</p>
        <p>Also, Angela went to Steyning and then I went took some stuff to the tip in Shoreham.</p>
        <p>After lunch they finished the connections and gradually brought the system up to temperature. The only problem was when the last fitter came to leave and couldn't find his van keys!</p>
        <p>So we had dinner in the warmth and sit in the sitting room without needing to be huddled around the gas fire.</p>
