        <h1>Friday 29th March</h1>
        <p>Another busy day, with plenty of sunshine and little wind. Actually the morning was spent checking email and checking the TC before going off to a pub in Hassocks for a WSMGOC pub run. Meanwhile, Angela went off to help Sandy with the Mother's Day flowers.</p>
        <p>There was a good turn-out, with a couple of MGAs, some Bs and a midget. The service was slow, but it was an enjoyable lunch. I was home just after three.</p>
        <p>While I was out, Ben had phoned. The Baxters have accepted our price reduction and it is expected that we will exchange contracts next week (Angela Payne is just waiting for a response to a question from the Land Registry). The date for completion is up to us, but we are suggesting the week beginning 29th April. I phoned Helliers movers to arrange for them to call on Monday to give us a quote.</p>
        <p>We then took the push mower to Rosemary Avenue and cut part of the grass. We also brought back some flattened cardboard boxes that Sandy had. These will be used for the contents of furniture that we want to dispose of before we move. We also loaded the back of the car with rubbish to take to the tip in the morning.</p>
