        <h1>Thursday 28th March</h1>
        <p>We seemed to be busy all day. We started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He seemed well and the notes said that he had been drinking well. We then went on to Morrisons for coffee, took electrical equipment to BHF and looked at cases, then did the weekly shop at Morrisons. We were then home quite early.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the piece of grass that I missed yesterday and I completed notes on the the Baxter's survey and sent them to Ben. We also received the GasSafe certificate, which I scanned and sent to the solicitor.</p>
        <p>I then cleaned up the old manual lawn mower for use at Rosemary Avenue, before bleeding a couple of radiators that were cold at the top.</p>
