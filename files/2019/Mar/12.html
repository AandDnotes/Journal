        <h1>Tuesday 12th March</h1>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning while I waited for the plumber from the High Street. He came at about 11:30 and said that he would provide a quotation this evening, which he did. He said that we also needed to fit thermostatic valves to radiators in living spaces.</p>
        <p>After lunch, in very strong winds and driving rain, I went to the RCEA talk on MH370 at Field Place. The speaker went on a bit and then I spoke with Mike about the Ringmer workshops. We were expecting the British Gas boiler man to call between five and seven. However, I got home just after five to find that he had come early and was almost finished. He had measured up and done a heat loss calculation, coming to the conclusion that we actually need a bigger boiler than the one we have been using for 27 years! He produced a quote there and then. It is £1000 more expensive than the others (in spite of a £500 discount), but includes a power flush and a larger boiler. He also gave us more confidence and should be able to have it installed before we go to Paul's.</p>
