        <h1>Friday 1st March</h1>
        <p>We started by walking down to Steyning with several bags of books for a charity shop. We have quite a few further such trips to make. A large part of the afternoon was spent reading and studying the papers sent by our solicitor in connection with the purchase of 31 Penlands Vale. She also wrote to acknowledge receipt of the sales document for our house. Meanwhile Angela went to some form of service at St Peter's church.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the SRFC meeting at Hillbarn Golf Club. It was a poor presentation about UAVs.</p>
