        <h1>Tuesday 26th March</h1>
        <p>Paul went back to work and Rowan went off to school, so we packed our cases and Krista took us to Capelsebrug in plenty of time to catch the train from Rotterdam Centraal. But all trains in the diecrion of Amsterdam were cancelled!</p>
        <p>So we caught a train to den Haag Centraal, expecting to get a train to Schiphol. But that train was so full, the staff would not let anyone else try to get on board. So we caught a very slow train to Leiden and from there got a fast train directly to Schiphol. We had time to eat half our sandwich at Schiphol, but then ate the other half on the plane before it took off.</p>
        <p>It was a fine, sunny and quite warm day in the UK and we were home just before four o'clock.</p>
