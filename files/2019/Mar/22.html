        <h1>Friday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>This morning we got up at the ridiculous time of 2:30 and were out of the house by ten past three. After a short diversion around Crawley, we arrived at Gatwick at about four, giving us time to have coffee before our flight to Amsterdam was called. After we had all boarded the 6:05 flight, the captain told us that Schiphol was fog-bound and currently we could not depart until nine o'clock! Luckily this was brought forward to 7:20 and eventually we were only about 45 minutes late into Amsterdam, although it was still very foggy when we landed. After a very long taxi, we ended up in a part of Schiphol that we had not seen before, but we had a pancake breakfast and then caught the train to Rotterdam. By then it was nearly time for Rowan to be collected from school, so we walked to Beurs and caught the Metro to Capelsebrug, arriving just as they all came to pick us up.</p>
        <p>We had a pleasant afternoon, mainly in the garden playing or sitting int he sunshine before an early dinner and a trip to Rowan's swimming awards. We took the early flight so that we would be there in time for her normal afternoon swimming session, but it was held in the evening! Anyway, there were 30 or 40 children who all did their tests and were awarded their diploma.</p>
