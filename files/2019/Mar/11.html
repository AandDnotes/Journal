        <h1>Monday 11th March</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day, firstly cooking at lunch club and then going to a WI committee meeting. I stayed in (rather than going to Victoria Grand) because our buyer's surveyor came to go over the house. I also talked to several plumbers about getting quotes to replace the boiler and one called to look at the job.</p>
        <p>I then had another telephone call during the afternoon to arrange a visit tomorrow. So we have two visits tomorrow. Then it was the WSMGOC meeting (and AGM) at West Chiltington. I won a bottle of wine.</p>
