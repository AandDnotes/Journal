        <h1>Tuesday 5th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning, taking a few more books to a charity shop, I talked to the house insurance company and to the solicitor. After lunch we signed the house purchase documents, getting John opposite to witness them. I also found a way to make my revised 'outings' web pages to work.</p>
        <p>We ate our main meal at lunchtime, complete with pancakes. Then, in the evening I went to Crawley to an IET talk on the spacecraft exploring Saturn and its moons. It was good, but was really a two-hour talk.</p>
