        <h1>Thursday 21st March</h1>
        <p>We started by going to the health centre, where Angela had a blood sample taken to check her cholesterol level. Results next week. We then went on to Victoria Grand to see Dad. They were having a training session, so there drive was full of cars.</p>
        <p>From there we went to Lyons Farm to do a small weekly shop. I popped over to Curry's to buy a sleeve for the Macbook. We were home by midday, which allowed us to have an early lunch so that I could go to the Gift Oversight Group meeting at Brighton University. I had to park in the B&amp;Q car park and walk along to the Cockcroft building. I was home at four. Angela had been to Rosemary Avenue to vacuum around and arrived home shortly after me.</p>
        <p>I then chased up the GasSafe certificate (they said they had no record of work being done at our property) so it is now in the hands of British Gas. Our buyer's solicitor has asked about access to drains etc. that go under neighbouring property.</p>
        <p>Then we packed, for an early start tomorrow.</p>
