        <h1>Thursday 14th March</h1>
        <p>We were trying to be early today since Angela had an hygienist appoint after lunch. However, while we were still getting ready to leave British Gas called to see if they could bring forward the boiler installation to Friday (tomorrow). So we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad earlier than usual and then went on to Lyons Farm. We were home by 11:30, so I had a while before lunch to start clearing the garage around the boiler.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did some more clearing while Angela went to the hygienist. Then I went to Brighton University to Sam Davis's farewell 'do'. They were still going strong when I left. After dinner I finished sweeping up, although I would still like to dismantle the steel shelving unit.</p>
