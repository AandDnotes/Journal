        <h1>Tuesday 19th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went off to Storrington on the bus to bank her WI cash/cheques, I went to Mike's to help with the light tunnels. There was no one there when I arrived and Mike did not get back until after twelve, half an hour after I'd run out of things to do. I stayed for lunch and left just after 2:30. He still has quite a lot to do before Thursday.</p>
        <p>Later on I went to Crawley for an IET Sussex committee meeting. There were only six of us, including a new member.</p>
