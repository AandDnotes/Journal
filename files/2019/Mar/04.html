        <h1>Monday 4th March</h1>
        <p>The day started quite bright, but during the afternoon we had some shar, heavy showers, including som hail. It didn't feel particularly warm either. Angela had a Lunch Club AGM this morning and so I went to Victoria Grand on my own. I showed Dad the photo of Pippin (and some of the others that he had already seen) and got home at about 11:30. Angela was back for lunch, as the treasurer for the lunch club!</p>
        <p>Between showers we went to Rosemary Avenue to collect the nest of tables and some paintings that we wanted, plus a pedal bin. I scanned the 'authority to exchange' form and sent it to Angela Payne. Then I worked further on my revised 'outings' web page.</p>
