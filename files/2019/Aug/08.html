        <h1>Thursday 8th August</h1>
        <p>Today, eventually, was a little more successful on the money transfer front. Angela started by taking the contents of the freezer to that in the church kitchen while I put the contents of the fridge in the one in the garage and turned off the fridge/freezer. Then, as usual on a Thursday we took a trip to Victoria Grand to see Dad.</p>
        <p>We were fairly early and didn't stay long (we are going again on Saturday) before we went to NatWest to try to get the money transferred. We were told that we should confirm the details with the broker by telephone to ensure that it is not a scam. So we came home, called TransferWise, went back into Worthing, and completed the transfer. We then went into Waitrose for lunch and to do some grocery shopping. When we got home we confirmed on the broker's web site that we had moved the money. Later, TransferWise emailed to say that the money would be in Victoria and Paul's accounts tomorrow.</p>
        <p>From Waitrose we went to the bathroom shop. We were early, but Paul Jones was ready for us. We made a few additions/changes (added a mirror and a non-slip surface to the shower tray and selected a toggle waste plug for the wash basin) to the list of parts and paid a deposit. The materials should all be available in October for the plumber to start.</p>
        <p>Later I updated our spreadsheet for the RBS account and estimated how many dollars we will need for our visit.</p>
