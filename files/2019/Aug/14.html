        <h1>Wednesday 14th August</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we left home with a car loaded with things for the tip. So we went to Victoria Grand first to visit Dad. we then went on to the Range warehouse for coffee and to look for 'craft' type things to take to Davis. We then went to the tip in the dry.</p>
        <p>We were back in time for lunch, after which I dealt with some IET email, then we did a bit of cleaning before packing our cases.</p>
