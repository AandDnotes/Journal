        <h1>Monday 12th August</h1>
        <p>A day not doing very much. Except Angela, who went to help at the lunch club and then a WI committee meeting. I dealt with several email and phoned Bernard to see how he was doing after his spell in hospital.</p>
        <p>In the early evening I went to the WSMGOC at West Chiltington, firstly to eat and then for the 'natter'. I had hoped to take the TC, but we had a thunder storm just before I was due to go.</p>
