        <h1>Friday 30th August</h1>
        <p>Today we only went out to have a Chinese meal for dinner. Brandon had been to work (but came home early), Victoria took the children to school and then went on to their friend's house (in Sacramento) to feed his cat!</p>
        <p>Otherwise we played with curtains, finally getting the lining in one of them. Now it is just a case of cutting off the bottom of the lining and then tackling the other window.</p>
        <p>I managed to get past the Dutch lesson (on subordinating conjunctions) that I had failed to complete on previous days. I also made more notes on Dutch grammar in the hope that it will help me remember some of the lessons.</p>
        <p>This evenings Chinese meal (at 5:30) was reasonable, but was in a rather bare 1960's style diner, but really without any 'style' at all. It was the usual 'quick in and out' type meal.</p>
        <p>The children went to bed at ten o'clock, although they don't need to get up early in the morning.</p>
