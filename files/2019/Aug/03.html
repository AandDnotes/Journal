        <h1>Saturday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to help at a coffee morning at the church. So I went to Steyning to buy some groceries and then called into the church for coffee. When I got home I cut the grass and then did the weekly accounts. After lunch I made a start on the monthly accounts and Angela worked in the garden. We would normally talk to Victoria at about four o'clock, but they had to go out, so we had dinner first and then spoke to them at 7:30. They have booked a house on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe for four nights.</p>
