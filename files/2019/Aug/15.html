        <h1>Thursday 15th August</h1>
        <p>Russel arrived a little before 10:30 and so we were at Gatwick in good time. The check-in and security was also very quick and after a coffee and half a sandwich our gate was notified. The plane took off at ten to two and we landed at San Fransisco just after 4pm local time. We both spent the entire flight either reading or trying to nap.</p>
        <p>The BART journey was not comfortable, but got us to Richmond in good time to catch the 7:07 train. Unfortunately it was delayed by 20 minutes due to 'congestion'. It was dark by the time that we reached Davis (now about 30 minutes late, just before nine o'clock) and we were surprised to see Victoria and both children waiting for us. They were in their new 'bus', which they had bought yesterday!</p>
        <p>We were in bed quite early.</p>
