        <h1>Tuesday 20th August</h1>
        <p>We managed another walk before breakfast this morning. Later we walked (and Juniper rode in a buggy) to the library. I sat outside (with a sleeping Juniper) while Austin, Victoria and Angela went inside to choose new books. We had a brief stop for a snack and then walked/rode home for lunch, after which Angela helped Austin make some muffins. Later we played football in the garden and I helped Austin make a start on his halloween costume (a dumper truck) by cutting holes in a cardboard box. He wants it to be used by him and his friend. I cut out four discs and we stuck on two as wheels. We must stick on the other two tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I managed to stay out of the pool, although the children had quite a long spell in it. Then they had a bath and were eventually in bed by nine. Brandon had cycled to a local brewing club and went to bed when he got home at 8:30.</p>
