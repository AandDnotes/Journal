        <h1>Friday 9th August</h1>
        <p>During the day, TransferWise emailed to say that they needed more documents to verify the source of the money that we wanted to transfer. So we sent them more documents and hope that will be enough.</p>
        <p>The fridge/freezer had been defrosting over night, so we pulled it out, cleaned it and turned it on again. This afternoon Angela retrieved the frozen food from the church kitchen freezer and we are now back to normal. We just hope that this has cleared the defrost drain tube and it will not leak water on the floor.</p>
        <p>I also took the opportunity to revise (slightly) my article for Main Gear on our run to West Dean college. I sent the text and photos to Roger. There was also a chance to put the 'carry-on' cases back in the loft and get down the big cases, ready for next week.</p>
        <p>We did some research on hand-held, cordless vacuum cleaners and decided to buy a small version, mainly for use on the stairs. We will go to Currys tomorrow on our way home from Victoria Grand to look at them. I also selected the plastic boxes that I want to use in the garage. Hopefully we can get those tomorrow also.</p>
