        <h1>Thursday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>An interesting and tiring day for not having done very much. We started by packing our cases for four nights away and then took the children to the playground so that Victoria could get on packing thier bags. Brandon came home for lunch (which was mainly trying to finish up remaining food) and we set off for Lake Tahoe just after one.</p>
        <p>We sat in the rear seats of their new 'bus', which were reasonably comfortable, but they don't have any lateral support for the twisty roads towards the end of the journey. We had expected to stop during the two-hour journey, but Juniper was asleep and so Brandon did not stop.</p>
        <p>The cabin in Meyers looked good. We had expected to go out for dinner, but Brandon and Victoria went to the supermarket and came back with food to cook for dinner. So Brandon cooked a spaghetti bolognese, which was good. While he was cooking we walked to the small lake and park nearby. V&B did the same after dinner.</p>
