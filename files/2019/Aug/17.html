        <h1>Saturday 17th August</h1>
        <p>After our morning walk before breakfast we spent the rest of the day playing with the children. Brandon and Juniper went off to do the weekly main supermarket shop while I helped Austin build more of his Labo devices. After lunch Brandon helped him and I played with Juniper. Later in the afternoon they persuaded me to go in the pool with them. It was not as warm as I thought!</p>
        <p>Victoria and Brandon went to a friend's 50th birthday, so we fed the children and put them to bed (at least by nine o'clock).</p>
