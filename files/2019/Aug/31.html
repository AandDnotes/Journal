        <h1>Saturday 31st August</h1>
        <p>While Brandon went off to Ed's to start making some beer the rest of us drove to Putah Creek Riparian Reserve (interface between land and a river or stream) to the south west of Davis. The idea was to walk beside the creek, which we did, but Austin wanted to come home as toon as we got there and Juniper complained about being tired all the way back to the car.</p>
        <p>Brandon was back as we were finishing lunch and took Victoria and Juniper off to do grocery shopping. Meanwhile we played with curtains. Victoria had cut off the bottom of the lining on one curtain, so I rehung that. I then pulled up the other curtain (roughly) and I removed the pole to change the end for the cords, put part of the cord in the right place, reduce the number of hook hangers and strengthen the attachment of the end brackets to the wall.</p>
        <p>Brandon had decided that they should sell their old car, which is the right decision. However, in typical Brandon style they took the car to a valet when they went shopping (it did look good) and spent the evening sorting out documents and placing an ad. It took them the whole evening to the exclusion of everything else. It had to be done then! They had told the children that they were to go to bed early this evening; so we sorted them out, only to find Brandon playing a computer game while Victoria finished of posting the ad.</p>
