        <h1>Friday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>We had a reasonable night's sleep in the hotel in Walsall, followed by a good value breakfast (including breakfast for two only increased the room rate by Â£10). So we set off on the M6, taking the M42 and then the M40 rather than going down the M5, which we saw was busy (stationary) on Monday. We then took the A34 all the way to Winchester. This is quite a good road, apart from the heavy traffic around Oxford and a queue due to some road works (that had not actually started).</p>
        <p>We then got on to the A272 and had a late lunch at Hinton Ampner, followed by a quick look around the house. The stretch through Storrington was slow, but we were home by five. We decided to try the new fish &amp; chip shop in Steyning. It was very good.</p>
