        <h1>Wednesday 21st August</h1>
        <p>This morning we walked to a 'shady' playground with a very reluctant Austin. We were late leaving because he was complaining so much, so it was hot on the way back.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took down one of the curtain poles, replaced some of the bracket screws (since they were falling off) and changed the number of hooks. The curtain was pulled up, but not enough!</p>
        <p>While dinner was being cooked the children and I went the pool. After dinner (nice lamb burgers, bland cuscus and grilled courgette and aubergine) we played Catan Junior while Juniper had a bath. As usual, Brandon played a computer game and went to bed at 8:30.</p>
