        <h1>Friday 16th August</h1>
        <p>We didn't sleep too badly, considering it was our first night in California. It is cool in the morning, so we went for a walk before breakfast. Brandon had already left for work when we got up at about 6:30.</p>
        <p>We really spent the day 'playing' with the children. This included taking them for a walk/cycle to a couple of parks and 'supervising' them in their pool. We didn't get too wet. I also helped Austin write his list of things to do and build a number of pars of his Labo devices. Brandon was home fairly early and had invited a couple of colleagues around for a beer.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day we were feeling very tired and were in bed just after 10:30.</p>
