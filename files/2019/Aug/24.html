        <h1>Saturday 24th August</h1>
        <p>It is nearly 9:30 and the children are still talking to each other as though it is the morning. They are in their beds, but Victoria is with them and basically ignoring them. And Brandon is in bed.</p>
        <p>It has been an interesting and exasperating day at the same time. We had a fairly leisurely start and then started driving around (completely around; 72 miles around) Lake Tahoe. We went around Emerald Bay, with spectacular views from the road. You couldn't stop because practically everyone else was doing so and and the sides of the road were full of cars and people. The road was very twisty and so a little further on Austin said he wanted to be sick. Brandon found somewhere to stop and they went into a shop for some drink. They both also took a travel-sickness tablet.</p>
        <p>Luckily the road was less twisty after that and we were soon at Tahoe City and found the target beach. However, the small car park was completely full. So we drove on a little and pulled into a shopping area, only to find that we could walk along a good path by the lake and get back to the beach. V&B bought some picnic lunch and we sat in the shade to eat it. We then moved down to the grass/beach area and the children went in the water; Juniper completely and Austin up to his waist. After a while they were bribed out with the promise of ice cream. We had seen an ice cream freezer outside a marine store near the marina (which had 'cornetto' type cones and ice lollies), but Brandon looked up other places and found one on the way back to the car in a shopping arcade. So we had to walk on in the sun and up two floors. To be honest, it was much better ice cream.</p>
        <p>We then drove on to a small, back-street brewery that Brandon wanted to visit. However, they would not admit children, so we continued our drive around the lake until we were back in South Lake Tahoe, where we diverted to another brewery. Brandon and I sampled four different beers, while the others had soft drinks. At least the children were able to make pictures. Austin had been grumpy, wanting to go back to the cabin, since we had the ice cream.</p>
        <p>It was still only 4:15, but they were looking for somewhere to have dinner and settled on a Mediterranean restaurant only a few miles away. The food was quite good and we got back to the cabin at about seven. V&B went straight off to get some groceries and we bathed the children. We all played games and read stories until they went to bed. It is now 9:45 and all sounds quiet!</p>
