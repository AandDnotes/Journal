        <h1>Wednesday 7th August</h1>
        <p>Not only was it Angela's WI walking group weekly outing, but it was their lunch. However, they all went home to dry off before going to the lunch!</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I went to the doctors to have skin spots 'frozen' off. Then I cooked my own meal. When Angela got home we set up the the two money transfers. We now just have to transfer money into the broker's account.</p>
        <p>After tea we went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Fisherman's Friends'. The hall was full to capacity and the film was very entertaining.</p>
