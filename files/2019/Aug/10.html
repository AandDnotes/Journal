        <h1>Saturday 10th August</h1>
        <p>It had been a very windy night, which disturbed my sleep, and it was windy all day until the evening. We started with a walk down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls for lunch. Then I did the weekly accounts, including a reconciliation against the statement.</p>
        <p>We had an early lunch since it was the Victoria Grand Garden Party, starting at 2:30, and we wanted to look at vacuum cleaners on the way. Quite a few residents and family members attended, but it was held in the lounge since the weather wasn't suitable and the the paving to get out into the garden had not been done. We had a glass of wine, a young(ish) lady sang for an hour and then we had tea and scones (and chocolate cake if you wanted it). Everyone seemed to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>On our way home we called into Argos to buy some plastic storage boxes (they only had one set of three, so I will try those first) and a small, hand-held vacuum, mainly for cleaning the stairs. We then bought a few items in Sainsbury's.</p>
        <p>We normally talk with Victoria on Saturday afternoon, so I had warned her that we might be late. When we got home (at about 5:15) they were just going out! However, Angela received confirmation from TransferWise that Victoria's money had been paid into her bank and that Paul's would be paid in on Monday.</p>
