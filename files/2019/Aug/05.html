        <h1>Monday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our 47th wedding anniversary. So in the evening we walked down to the Italian restaurant in the High Street. It was surprisingly busy and we had a good meal.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day we went to visit Dad at Victoria Grand, then going on to Waitrose to do a little shopping. I spent the afternoon catching up on some IET email, while Angela did more work in the garden.</p>
