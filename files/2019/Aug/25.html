        <h1>Saturday 25th August</h1>
        <p>A much quieter and more relaxing day. After a late breakfast (Brandon had eaten before we got down) we loaded made a picnic, loaded the car with folding chairs and drove the few hundred yards down to Lake Baron. A local church group were setting up and had reserved all the picnic tables, at lease, those in the shade. Most of the people arrived later.</p>
        <p>We started with lunch, sat under an awning above the grass leading down to the beach and water. Juniper, Austin and Brandon then went into the water, only Juniper up to her neck. Before they were ready to come out of the water Angela and I went for a walk around the lake, about a mile. It was generally a well made path, but it was very hot.</p>
        <p>By the time we were back the children were dry and dressed, so we decamped and went to the playground. That was a bit crowded until the 'congregation' went down to the river for some baptism ceremonies. We didn't stay much longer, returning to the cabin to play games. Victoria and Brandon cooked beef burgers and we reheated chips from last night's dinner at the restaurant! But we did have some quite nice wine.</p>
        <p>While V&B went for a walk we watched a show put on by Austin and Juniper. Then we did our Dutch lessons while they had a bath and then read stories.</p>
