        <h1>Sunday 4th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I completed the monthly accounts and replied to Ramon about someone who wants to apply for an EEGS grant. Angela was staying out for lunch. Since I have developed a head cold I sat for a while after my lunch.</p>
        <p>Just as Angela arrived home so we spoke with Paul and Krista. Rowan was busy!</p>
