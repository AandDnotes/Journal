        <h1>Monday 6th August</h1>
        <p>Today was the day that we planned to transfer money from Bay's estate to Victoria and Paul. However, when we tried to set up a transfer via a foreign exchange broker, they advised that some banks would not transfer that amount of money in one transaction. In fact we had already found that RSB, when using their foreign exchange facilities, limited a transfer to £10,000 per day. Otherwise the limit is £20,000 per day. Angela spoke to someone at RBS who said that we could transfer more money by going into a branch. So after lunch we went to Brighton. But, although they could transfer the sums, they had to do it there and then. Using the RBS facility to move £385,000 to the US would give them over $6,000 less than if we use a broker.</p>
        <p>So we need to set up the transfers with the broker and then go into an RBS branch and transfer the money into the Broker's account. However, it seems that we can use a Nat West branch, such as the one in Worthing.</p>
