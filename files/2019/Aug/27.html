        <h1>Tuesday 27th August</h1>
        <p>In spite of it being a much quieter day today we are still very tired at the end of it. Before lunch we all went to the library to change some of the children's books. We set off walking first and they followed on their biles. On the way back we called into a coffee shop for a little quiet time.</p>
        <p>We did various things with the children during the afternoon, including Angela helping them cook some banana muffins. After a good dinner they both had a short time in the pool before they had a bath. It was still 8:30 before they even reached their bedroom. Tomorrow is their first day back at school.</p>
