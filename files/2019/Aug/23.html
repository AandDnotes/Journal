        <h1>Friday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>Today was a good day, spoilt somewhat by an argument between Brandon and Victoria about what we should do tomorrow.</p>
        <p>This morning, after a cooked breakfast, we drove into South Lake Tahoe and parked in a wooded area. The children had a play in a playground and then we walked to look at the lake and then had an early lunch (Chinese style), followed by coffee in another cafe. We then waited for the courtesy bus to take us to Zephyr Cove (in Navada), where we boarded a paddle steamer (run on diesel) for a trip on the lake. It was a two-hour trip across the lake to Emerald Bay and back. It was a little long for the children, but they seemed to find it quite exciting.</p>
        <p>The bus took us back to the hotel from which it had picked us up and, after walking back to the car, we drove to a pizza restaurant. They served very good pizzas, but it was a pity that I knocked Austin's lemonade in my lap and Juniper would not eat anything. Brandon sampled a local beer and so Victoria drove back to the cabin.</p>
