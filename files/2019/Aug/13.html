        <h1>Tuesday 13th August</h1>
        <p>I had been watching the weather forecast to find a time to give the TC a run. I thought I might be able to take it to the WSMGOC meeting last night, but there was a thunder storm not long before I was due to leave! The weather forecast said that today would be fine, but it rained heavily periodically throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Angela started cutting the grass after lunch, but it started raining. By about five o'clock it was dry enough for me finish it.</p>
        <p>I did some more refinement and checking of my house heat loss calculations and PV panel output over the year. It seems the best we could do is generate 20% of our energy needs across the year, varying from 95% in July and 4% in December and January. I also started looking at electric under floor heating.</p>
