        <h1>Thursday 1st August</h1>
        <p>After another good (and quiet) night's sleep it was time to take our leave of Sally and Richard. However, Richard collected together a number of plants in pots and Sally modified a painting that she wanted to give us.</p>
        <p>We left Croft Head at 10:45 and stopped at a farm shop to buy a couple of things for Linda. We then went on to Lymm, arriving just after 12:30. We had lunch with Linda, seeing the changes they had made to their house. It was about 4:15 when we left for Walsall. The M6 was busy, but kept moving, even through the long stretch of roadworks. We easily found the hotel and ate in the restaurant. Not as good as last night.</p>
