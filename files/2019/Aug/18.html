        <h1>Sunday 18th August</h1>
        <p>Once again we started the day, quite early, with a walk before breakfast. It was perhaps a little shorter, but we looked at the new houses for sale nearby.</p>
        <p>It was a little cooler today, only 28 degrees C, so we went off in their new 'bus' to the arboretum and walked around part of an artificial lake. We saw turtles and a ground squirrel (chipmonk). After lunch the children made gingerbread men/shapes and later Juniper and I went in the pool. She swam under water with her eyes open!</p>
