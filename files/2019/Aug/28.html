        <h1>Wednesday 28th August</h1>
        <p>Today was the children's first day back at school. More correctly it was Austin's first day back (now in second grade) and Juniper went back to her pre-school after taking a couple of weeks off.</p>
        <p>That meant that we had a day to ourselves, at least until Austin came home, which was an hour earlier than other days of the week. So we walked into downtown Davis to buy our train Amtrak tickets to get to Richmond next Monday. We also bought (and sent) a postcard to Dad and bought Juniper a couple of small birthday presents. We got home about one (it was quite hot by then), but Austin was home not long after we had finished lunch.</p>
        <p>So the afternoon was spent playing with Austin and then Juniper when she got home.</p>
