        <h1>Monday 19th August</h1>
        <p>It is ten o'clock in the evening and Juniper is still awake and full of beans! Austin is asleep, but Juniper had a nap before dinner.</p>
        <p>This morning we went for a walk to a nature area (and parks) to the north. Austin did not want to go and Juniper gave up riding her bike when we got there! So I had to carry it home.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we (Austin, Juniper and I) spent quite some time in the pool.</p>
