        <h1>Thursday 29th August</h1>
        <p>This evening Victoria took Austin to a a cub scout pack meeting at the Explore Centre. Meanwhile Brandon went to a 'back to school' night at Austin's school. That meant that Juniper and I went in the pool!</p>
        <p>The earlier part of the day was much quieter and spent mainly working on curtains. I fixed the track and Angela tacked up the hem while Victoria sew'd together the pieces of lining material. I also spent some time sorting out a photo (that had been scanned) that was showing up as a black rectangle.</p>
