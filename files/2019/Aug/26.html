        <h1>Monday 26th August</h1>
        <p>We left Meyers this morning, at 0940! We could have stoped at somewhere like Placeville or Folsom so as to see somewhere else, but we drove straight back to Davis, picking up some Mexican food at a local fast food outlet. The first part of the journey was very twisty, particularly for Austin.</p>
        <p>I helped Austin build (part of) a model solar system and played with Juniper while Brandon went to feed Dan's cat (in Sacramento) and do some shopping. Then V&B and Juniper went out to do more shopping and we helped Austin fit his Lego cards in the book. Then, after Brandon had dosed the pool with chlorine, the children and I went in. It was very warm.</p>
        <p>Dinner was some very tasty steak with salad, but at nine o'clock the children were still playing while Brandon had gone to bed and Victoria was looking at her phone!</p>
