        <h1>Friday 4th October</h1>
        <p>Luckily the men coming to clear the gutters and fit a mesh did not arrive until 9:30, so we had a bit of a lie-in. We then spent most of the morning playing games with Rowan (which she generally won). It rained nearly all morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch the weather improved and they went to the supermarket to buy things for cake making while I played with Flo in the garden. When they got back they baked a lemon drizzle cake and we helped Rowan make some cake decorations.</p>
        <p>Paul was late home since it was his company's monthly Friday evening get-together, when the boss gives them an update.</p>
