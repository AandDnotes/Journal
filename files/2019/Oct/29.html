        <h1>Tuesday 29th October</h1>
        <p>We were able to have a lie in this morning and a leisurely shower, since the plumber (and plasterer) did not come today. Angela went down to the shops while did something or other indoors.</p>
        <p>Just before three I set off for Brighton, via Shoreham (to park) and the 700 bus, for the talk we were giving at Bellerby's College. Ramon's boss had hurt ankle and so tried to do his talk via Skype. We lost the connection part way through, so he finished off on the phone! The rest went quite well, although there were only about a dozen students. I got home at 7:45, with a worsening cough and throat.</p>
