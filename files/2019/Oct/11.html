        <h1>Friday 11th October</h1>
        <p>It rained all morning. Luckily Angela didn't get too wet when she went down to the High Street. I phoned the doctors (who phone back) about the diarrhoea caused by the antibiotics. Take probiotics she said.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to the carpet shop and ordered the Karndean for the bathroom. On our way back collected the two paintings that we had framed.</p>
