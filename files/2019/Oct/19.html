        <h1>Saturday 19th October</h1>
        <p>The day started with Angela noticing that water was coming through the downstairs shower room ceiling! Waster was coming out of the cistern in the bathroom and dripping down on to the floor. Initially I put a tub under it, but later managed to remove the worktop and tighten part of the ball valve (actually a more modern, plastic equivalent)so as to stop water spraying up to the cistern top and then running out. It is all going to be removed on Monday.</p>
        <p>In spite of our coughs we walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper, some bread rolls, a courgette and some meat for Sunday. We also called by the library so that Angela could borrow another book. Luckily the weather was fine, but we were quite tired by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria, for an hour and a half. She and Brandon are also still suffering with coughs.</p>
