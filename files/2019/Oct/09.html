        <h1>Wednesday 9th October</h1>
        <p>Angela started by catching the bus to Storrington to get her WI bank statement for her accounts. Meanwhile I took the TC to Parham house to join the Sussex Wanderers. There I met up with David F-B, with the agreement that I would navigate and he would take his modern TF on the run. So I left the TC at Parham, we did the run in the sunshine and then returned to Parham for lunch.</p>
        <p>I had called the doctor in the morning about my cough and they said someone from the triage team would call me after three. Luckily I was home before 2:30, when they called and made me an appointment to se the GP at five. By the time that I got home from Parham Angela was at table tennis. After she got home I walked to the surgery. The doctor listened to my chest and decided that I might have a chest infection, so prescribed a week of antibiotics.</p>
