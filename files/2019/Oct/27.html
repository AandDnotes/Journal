        <h1>Sunday 27th October</h1>
        <p>In spite of her cough, Angela went to church (she was doing the coffee). She said she coughed a lot on the way there, but hardly coughed while there. I did the weekly accounts and then investigated the kitchen cooker fan, which had tripped a circuit breaker. I removed the fan, but couldn't see anything physically wrong, so I put it back and plugged it into an extension lead. One of the bulbs had blown, so I replaced it and they and the fan worked!</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the grass, front and back, just before we spoke to Paul.</p>
