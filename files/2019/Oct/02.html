        <h1>Wednesday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>Today was really about 'tidying up' before we go off to Rotterdam tomorrow. I updated the current accounts and did the monthly accounts. Stopping only to help Angela put compost in the new pot in the front garden. She then planted it with the things we bought earlier.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I did my packing. Then I 'played' with my heat loss spread sheet. When Angela got home she did her packing.</p>
