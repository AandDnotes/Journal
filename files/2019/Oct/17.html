        <h1>Thursday 17th October</h1>
        <p>After phoning Victoria Grand and leaving a message to say that, due to our health, we would not be visiting Dad today, we went off to Worthing. We visited the bank to check that Angela's replacement debit card had not been sent to our old address (it hasn't yet been produced), buying a door mat and did a slightly reduced groceries shop in Waitrose.</p>
        <p>We spent the afternoon recovering, although Angela did a little in the garden and cooked dinner. I mainly read the paper!</p>
