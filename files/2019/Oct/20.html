        <h1>Sunday 20th October</h1>
        <p>All we really did today, apart from the normal getting lunch and dinner, was to clear the bathroom ready for the plumber and talk with Paul et al. Although I did spend a little time on my 'zero carbon' blog post.</p>
        <p>It was a dry day with some sunshine, albeit a little breezy, but our coughs still made us feel lethargic. Overall mine seems a little easier, although I still have bouts of intense coughing. Angela's is little changed.</p>
