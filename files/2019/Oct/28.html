        <h1>Monday 28th October</h1>
        <p>We were expecting the plasterer to come today, but his car was damaged over the weekend and so he did not come. So I went to Victoria Grand on my own and Angela made cushion covers. The plumber did what he could and left at lunch time.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we noticed that the heating was not working! Plenty of hot water, but the downstairs radiators were cold, whereas they had been hot earlier. The plumber phoned to say that the plasterer could not come until Wednesday, so I asked if he had done anything that might stop the heating. He came out, but could not work out what was wrong. He turned off the hot water heating so that the pump was only acting on the radiators and they got hot. He then turned the hot water heating back on and all seems well.</p>
        <p>After dinner Angela went to a lunch club meeting at the church.</p>
