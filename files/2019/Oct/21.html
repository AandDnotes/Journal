        <h1>Monday 21st October</h1>
        <p>We were up early, ready for the plumber to arrive at 8:30, which he did. The two of them stripped the bathroom and were away by 12:30. Meanwhile I went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad.</p>
        <p>Rather than going to her WI meeting, Angela took bags and instructions at the start and went back to pick up the cash at the end. I did some work on the potential costs of things we could do to the house in the way of moving towards zero carbon.</p>
