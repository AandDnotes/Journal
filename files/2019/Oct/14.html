        <h1>Monday 14th October</h1>
        <p>Angela was off early to help cook at the the lunch club. Meanwhile I went off to Victoria Grand to visit Dad, going via Lyons Farm to get a photo printed. I then called there on the way back to buy some fruit, sandwich filling and some brake cleaner.</p>
        <p>It was quite late before I got back and my cough was bad. I had a lot of email, mainly about IET STEM activities. After Angela got home I cancelled my meal at the WSMGOC meeting due to my cough.</p>
