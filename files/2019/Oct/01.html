        <h1>Tuesday 1st October</h1>
        <p>We started by going into Worthing so that Angela could pay in her coffee morning cash. We also bought some Euros for our trip to Paul's.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to a funeral service and later we collected the frozen food from the church freezer, packing it into the tiny freezer that had been on for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to drive to Crawley for an IET committee meeting. It started raining heavily just as I got to Crawley. Then it rained heavily most of the way home.</p>
