        <h1>Thursday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier than usual so as to start our journey to Berkenwoude. Although we 'closed up' the house and left at 9:30, we spent 15 minutes in Steyning trying to find mince pies to take to Paul. In the end we found some in Smiths at Gatwick airport!</p>
        <p>Gatwick North Terminal is not a relaxing place. We had trouble finding a place to have a coffee that wasn't set up for meals and it was very noisy. However, the flight was on time, although there were noise passengers behind us, and when we arrived at Schiphol (and collected our bag) there was a fast train about to leave. So we were in Rotterdam earlier than expected. We arrived at Capelsebrug, having phoned Krista from Rotterdam, but found a text message asking us to catch the bus to Krimpen aan den Ijssel, since Krista was stuck in traffic. So we did that and met Krista and Rowan between the bus station and the swimming pool. Consequently we arrived after Paul had got home and were quite tired.</p>
        <p>After dinner we started playing a game and then just sat for the rest of the evening.</p>
