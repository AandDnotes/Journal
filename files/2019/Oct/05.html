        <h1>Saturday 5th October</h1>
        <p>A dry day, sunny at times, but not particularly warm. So after a late rise it was a mixture of games and taking Pippin and Flo for a walk. Towards the end of the afternoon we went to the golf club and Krimpen aan de Lek for a meal. The place didn't really have much character, but the food was good.</p>
