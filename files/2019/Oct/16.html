        <h1>Wednesday 16th October</h1>
        <p>After a bad night coughing I started by phoning the doctor. It was the usual call back by one of the triage team. However, I got an appointment at midday. Dr Jain was running late, but she said that my chest infection had not been affected by the antibiotic! So she prescribed an alternative (another week's course) and sent me to Southlands Hospital for a chest X-ray and blood test.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela's cough/cold seems to be getting worse. So after lunch we called at the Steyning Centre (Angela had a cheque to deliver and should have been playing table tennis) and then drove to Southlands. We were in and out within half an hour.</p>
        <p>We also phone Kate to say that we would not be visiting them on Friday.</p>
