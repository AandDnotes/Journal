        <h1>Saturday 12th October</h1>
        <p>Today it rained for pretty much all of the day! The rain wasn't hard and there was little wind, but it was gloomy. Angela went off to Holmebush to buy food to the lunch club on Monday and I tackled the weekly accounts. It took me all morning (apart from when I helped Angela take some stuff down to the church) and part of the afternoon to reconcile my accounts against the bank statement and find the source of a substantial input to the account. We have a joint savings account that pays annual interest into our current account.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria et al.</p>
