        <h1>Tuesday 15th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early this morning to be taken to Bognor for a meeting. She took her lunch with her and so arrived home just before 4:30. The day was mostly dry, but with occasional showers, which stopped the washing getting dry.</p>
        <p>Apart from hanging out the washing, I spent the day indoors, mainly dealing with consequences of emails, although I did hang Sally's painting in the dining room.</p>
