        <h1>Thursday 24th October</h1>
        <p>Rather than going off to Victoria Grand and to the supermarket I started by going to the GP. She wanted to understand why I have some tissue thickening in the upper lobes of my lungs. This could be due to the pneumonia I had as a teenager. Otherwise, the X-ray and blood test was clear. I need to go back in three weeks if the cough is no better.</p>
        <p>Angela's WI auditor called for the books just before lunch, but otherwise we stayed at home and sat.</p>
