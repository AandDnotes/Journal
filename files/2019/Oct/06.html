        <h1>Sunday 6th October</h1>
        <p>It rained for most of the day and was not particularly warm. So I stayed inside, since my cough is getting no better. We completed the jigsaw and Angela helped Rowan make gingerbread men.</p>
        <p>Greet and Wim came for lunch and then we played more games into the evening.</p>
