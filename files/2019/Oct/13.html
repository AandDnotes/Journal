        <h1>Sunday 13th October</h1>
        <p>Another rainy day. Angela went to church this morning, taking the chicken pieces with her to hand over to Anita. Meanwhile, I did backups and started dealing with a collection of IET related email.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke to Paul and Rowan, since Krista and Paul are going to a concert in Rotterdam this evening. I then dealt with more email.</p>
