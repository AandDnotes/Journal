        <h1>Thursday 10th October</h1>
        <p>The day started like most Thursdays. We went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He said that Chris and Alan had visited with the Theo and Ollie and two dogs. We then went off to Lyons Farm to do our weekly groceries shop.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the back lawns and then cleaned and sharpened Angela's secateurs while Angela racked and then cut the front grass. After dinner I called the plumber (who had emailed to say that his start would be delayed) and agreed with him that we would get the Karndean supplier to fit it. Angela meanwhile worked on her WI end-of-year accounts.</p>
