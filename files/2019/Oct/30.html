        <h1>Wednesday 30th October</h1>
        <p>Another day without any work on the bathroom. The plasterer was waiting for a replacement car to be delivered and it hadn't arrived by two o'clock, so it wasn't worth coming.</p>
        <p>Angela ventured to the High Street after lunch, but otherwise, in spite of the weather being fine, we didn't venture out. We just nursed our colds.</p>
        <p>I simply wrote some email and made more notes in my reminiscences.</p>
