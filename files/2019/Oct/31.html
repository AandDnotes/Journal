        <h1>Thursday 31st October</h1>
        <p>Halloween and the last day of October! The plasterer finally arrived (quite late), but only did some preparatory work with base-coat plaster. So he was gone before lunch. Hopefully he will be back in the morning and spend the day putting on a top-coat. That probably means that the plumber will not be able to start installation work until Monday. However, the flooring man is due on the following Friday.</p>
        <p>I'd had a bad night with my cold and Angela was also still coughing. However, she went off to do the weekly shop and I stayed home (with the plaster). We did not visit Dad, although I did phone to let them know. Otherwise I continued making notes in my reminiscences and did some reading.</p>
