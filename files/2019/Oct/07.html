        <h1>Monday 7th October</h1>
        <p>Another quiet, but dry day. Rowan went to school, but was home for lunch and then back by 3:30. I helped Paul remove some old drinking troughs from the stalls in the stable and later we cleaned the rabbit's indoor cage, ready for them to come inside for the winter.</p>
        <p>Greet and Wim came for coffee (and biscuits) and to say goodbye this afternoon. They found out that we will be back for Christmas!</p>
