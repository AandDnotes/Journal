        <h1>Tuesday 8th October</h1>
        <p>Our journey home from Berkenwoude started well. Paul took us to Capelsebgug and we caught the early train from Rotterdam to Schiphol. We were too early to check our bag, so we went to our favourite cafe in the station (which has now changed to Eggs &amp; Co) and had lunch. The plane was a little delayed leaving, but passport control and baggage at Gatwick were fast and we left Gatwick car park at about 4â€™clock. Actually, in the bus to the car park it started raining heavily and we got quite wet, even though the car was near the bus stop, and it continued to about Handcross. However, at Partridge Green we turned on to the Steyning road, into a queue, which went all the way to the Steyning bypass. It took us over two and a half hours to get home. It seems that an accident at Dial Post had closed the A24 and traffic was diverted down via Partridge Green. According to the travel news on the local radio, Henfield was also jammed.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street to get some milk and bread and bought fish and chips.</p>
