        <p>The plumber arrived at 8:30, but left before lunch, not being able to manoeuvre the shower tray. He is coming back tomorrow morning with some help.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the village to buy a paper and got very wet in the process and did the weekly accounts and some more on my reminiscences. Otherwise we are both still coughing well!</p>
