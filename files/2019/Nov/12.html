        <h1>Tuesday 12th November</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Angela took her cash to bank in Storrington and I started by collecting Greg and going to the Sussex Chamber of Commerce AGM. We found the meeting interesting and their membership should be useful to us. Perhaps the biggest problem is that we might be seen as competing with the CoC on training.</p>
        <p>After taking Greg home I went back to Crawley, filled the Panda with petrol and went to the Hawth. I waited there for two and a half hours before the IET Sussex AGM and talk. We had a very good turn-out.</p>
        <p>So I left home just before 11 and got home just before ten.</p>
