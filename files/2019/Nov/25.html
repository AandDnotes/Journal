        <h1>Monday 25th November</h1>
        <p>An early start and a long, tiring day. Hamish picked me up at 7:30 and took me to Crawley. Along with Mike we ran three Energy Watch workshops at the Eco Summit. It all seemed to go well.</p>
        <p>I then drove to Bernards and he took me back to Crawley for a Sussex Network committee meeting.</p>
        <p>It seems that my speaker for next week has left UK Power Networks and not told anyone that he had agreed to give us a talk! Their Communications Manager has said that he will try to find someone to give the talk.</p>
