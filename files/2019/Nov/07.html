        <h1>Thursday 7th November</h1>
        <p>I had a bad night. I got up at four o'clock to go to the loo and then coughed repeatedly for over an hour. So this morning I phoned the doctor's surgery and was surprised to get an appointment with Dr Jain at 9:50. She was also suffering from a cough! She couldn't find anything other than the symptoms of a virus, so she prescribed the use of an inhaler. Shae said that I didn't have asthma, but coughs could irritate the upper airways and the inhaler might relieve the symptoms. If it's had no effect after a week then I should phone and she will replace the substance with one containing a steroid.</p>
        <p>Angela drove me to the surgery and waited until I had been seen. She then went off to visit Dad and do the week's grocery shopping, while I walked home. It was a chilly, but sunny morning, with only a light wind.</p>
