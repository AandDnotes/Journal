        <h1>Tuesday 26th November</h1>
        <p>This morning we went to visit Dad at Victoria Grand. We were quite late, so we were only able to stay until he was ready to go to lunch. We then went into Worthing for Angela to get some things for the lunch club. We also bought a couple of presents and I bought some shoes and a paint brush.</p>
        <p>Consequently we were quite late home for lunch. What was left of the afternoon was spent writing email. I had a reply from UK Power Networks who have found a replacement speaker. So I emailed her and Angela produced her WI programme for next year.</p>
