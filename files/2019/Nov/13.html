        <h1>Wednesday 13th November</h1>
        <p>We had no plumber today. The electrician should be here tomorrow and the plumber back on Saturday. Since Angela is going to the theatre tomorrow she went off to do the supermarket shopping this morning. Then David F-B arrived in his TF. Since it was fine and sunny I had put the TC's hood down and we set off for Horsham to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. We then had a good run to Goddards Green for lunch. It was overcast and gloomy by the time that we got back, but had stayed dry. We did 59 miles in the TC. Meanwhile, Angela went to table tennis.</p>
