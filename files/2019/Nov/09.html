        <h1>Saturday 9th November</h1>
        <p>Today I didn't even go out as far as the garage! Angela, on the other hand, firstly went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then took her cake and desert to the church and helped with lunches for the Christmas Fair. Meanwhile, I did the weekly accounts and the plumber arrived early, but left at lunchtime.</p>
        <p>When Angela got home at about four o'clock, we spoke with Victoria. They are still having difficulty getting the children to bed.</p>
