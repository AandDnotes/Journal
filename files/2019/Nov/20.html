        <h1>Wednesday 20th November</h1>
        <p>Angela tried to make an appointment to see the doctor about her hearing, but had to wait for a doctor to phone. So she didn't get to table tennis, but did get an appointment towards the end of the day. However, there is nothing the doctor can do. She hopes that it will gradually get better.</p>
        <p>I managed to get some filler into the gap by the bathroom door before going to Falmer for an IET talk. We had been moved to another lecture theatre, but the food/drinks we put in another one!</p>
