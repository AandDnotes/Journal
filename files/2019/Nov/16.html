        <h1>Saturday 16th November</h1>
        <p>After yesterday's journey home from High Wyckham I had difficulty getting to sleep and so have been tired today. And, of course, the plumber arrived early. However, he had done all he could by lunchtime and went home. There is no sign of the wall cabinet on the invoice, so I must phone Leaney's during the week to get them to supply one. The plumber is still waiting for some bits from Leaney's and so will come back with the electrician at some point during the week. If we want, we can use the toilet and the wash basin.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street and I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the statement. Then we had an early lunch and went firstly to Dunelm to get Rowan's narwhale and some cushions. We then went on to B&amp;Q to get some paint for the bathroom. I may be able to paint the ceiling, walls and skirting board before the plumber returns.</p>
        <p>Then we spoke with Victoria, where things seem as chaotic as ever. Luckily our colds/coughs have nearly disappeared.</p>
