        <h1>Wednesday 6th November</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day. The plumber was quite productive, although he spent a lot of time just fitting the cabinet tops. And Angela did go to the High Street and to table tennis. So I suppose it was just me who didn't do anything, except cough and blow my nose.</p>
