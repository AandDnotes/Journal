        <h1>Saturday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>Another day with no progress on the bathroom. We thought that the plumber might come today. The good thing was that Angela got her glasses back.</p>
        <p>I discovered that I was overdue with submitting the November newsletter, so started drafting it and collecting the photos.We also spent some time talking with Victoria.</p>
