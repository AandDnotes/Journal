        <h1>Friday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>A very busy day. Angela started by walking down to the Post Office and butchers and found that someone had picked up two pairs of glasses from the P.O. yesterday and would be returning one pair (presumably Angela's) in the morning.</p>
        <p>We then drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Brighton. There, we bought material for cushion covers, some books and loaf tins. we had lunch and then came back and drove to the Mayberry garden centre to by more Christmas presents. We were home by about four o'clock.</p>
        <p>In the Churchill Centre we walked past the Apple shop and i said that at some time I would need to replace the MacBook as it became more and more out of date. When we got home I found that the MacBook battery was completely flat! It has charged and is running off the battery, so I will need to see how it goes.</p>
