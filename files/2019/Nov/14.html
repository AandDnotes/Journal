        <h1>Thursday 14th November</h1>
        <p>This afternoon Angela went to Chichester Theatre to see 'Calendar Girls, the musical'. Meanwhile, the electrician (and his son) came to install the bathroom lights and extractor fan. He also wired up the radiator 'summer heater'. He did not arrive until 3:15 and will need to come back to install the fan exit in the end wall and connect the mirror.</p>
        <p>So I stayed home. I spent some time going through the Barefoot notes and replied to email.</p>
