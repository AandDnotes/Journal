        <h1>Monday 18th November</h1>
        <p>Another day of doing very little. I did go through the Barefoot slides again in preparation for tomorrow's workshop. After lunch Angela went to her WI AGM while I put some knotting on the knots in the new piece of skirting board and started putting filler between the architrave behind the door and the wall. It will need quite a lot more.</p>
