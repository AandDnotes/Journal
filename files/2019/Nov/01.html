        <h1>Friday 1st November</h1>
        <p>The plasterer arrived at 8:30 and the plumber mid morning, so it was busy in the house. We now have a lot of copper pipes and a shower pump in the airing cupboard.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street and then to an afternoon tea at the church. I did more work on my reminiscences. Then, after dinner I went to the flying club meeting, taking along the fuselage of my Tiger Moth. There was a 'concourse' competition for ARTFs/bought models and for scratch/kit built models, with a good selection of models. There were two other part-built models (which were not in the competition).</p>
