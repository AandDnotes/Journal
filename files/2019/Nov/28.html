        <h1>Thursday 28th November</h1>
        <p>A busy day, but at least it was dry and some sunshine this morning. We started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand and then went on to Worthing to do the weekly shop. We did this in Waitrose, but also went on to Lidl and Morrison to get items for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch I went down to the High Street to get my hair cut. Finally I then put another coat of primer around the edges of the ceiling in the bathroom.</p>
