        <h1>Tuesday 5th November</h1>
        <p>The plumber brought a helper today since he had some large, heavy items to take up stairs. The shower tray is installed and the two main glass screens are in place.</p>
        <p>Angela went out a couple of times, to the High Street and to visit someone. Otherwise we mainly sat around coughing and blowing noses, as well as the usual responding to email.</p>
