        <h1>Saturday 30th November</h1>
        <p>I managed to put two coats of primer around the edges of the bathroom walls today, one in the morning and one after lunch. Tomorrow I'll try coating the middle of the ceiling and walls with a roller.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers and the newsagents while I was paining. She then spent most of the morning cooking soup and Anzac biscuits. Otherwise it was a case of writing letters to go in Christmas cards.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we had a relatively short chat with Victoria and Austin. Juniper didn't say anything, except goodbye.</p>
