        <h1>Tuesday 19th November</h1>
        <p>Dad's birthday. We went to see him this morning and just as we were leaving so Alan and Chris arrived. So we went back in for a while. Then we went into Worthing to bank Angela's WI cash and buy some filler. After a late dinner the electrician arrived to finish fitting the fan, connect the pump and the mirror.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I went to Cowfold to run a Barefoot workshop. It seemed to go well. From there I went to Crawley to a STEM meeting with STEM Sussex, HUBSEE and IMechE representatives from Sussex and Kent. It seems that we can expect to continue as before (almost) in spite of the demise of STEM Sussex.</p>
