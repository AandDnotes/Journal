        <h1>Sunday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>By comparison with yesterday, today was very calm and dry/sunny in the morning, then drizzly in the afternoon and much wetter in the evening.</p>
        <p>The plumber (and his son) called at about 10 o'clock to move the shower tray from the garage to the bathroom. He will be back in the morning to fit it.</p>
        <p>Angela was at church and I did some work on my reminiscences. After lunch we spoke with Paul and Angela made some tomato soup. Her bread this morning did not work out, so I made another one.</p>
