        <h1>Sunday 24th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church while I completed the November issue of the IET Sussex newsletter. After lunch I sent a test version to Bernard for review. We then went off to M&S at Holmbush to get a couple of shirts since Angela had 20% off everything. We also bought interesting things like a new spatula!</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. She had made a book (with four pages), but they were, as yet, blank.</p>
