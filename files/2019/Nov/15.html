        <h1>Friday 15th November</h1>
        <p>We set off at 9:23 for Hughenden Manor, just outside High Wykham, arriving at ten to twelve (including a coffee stop on the M25). Dick and Kate were in the car park, having arrived a few minutes earlier. After a bottle of fizz and a packet of crisps we went to the cafe for some lunch and a chat. Afterwards we discovered that the house closed at three o'clock, so we only had half an hour to do a quick tour.</p>
        <p>So it was about 3:30 when we left for home. The M25 was very slow and it started raining as we got on to the A24. Nearly every roundabout was accompanied by a queue of traffic and so, in the dark and the rain, it took us until 6:15 to get home. A good, but tiring day.</p>
