        <h1>Sunday 17th November</h1>
        <p>A particularly unproductive day! I had intended making a start on painting the bathroom since we don't yet know when the plumber will be back to finish off. I found the knotting and a couple of paint rollers, but I couldn't find my brushes. I'm hoping that they are in a box behind the plumber's remaining wall panels. So I inspected the room, finding that there is quite a bit of filling to do behind the door. However, I did pull out (and replace) one of the ceiling lights to see how they could be moved for painting the ceiling, but I can't find out how the mirror is removed from the wall. A search for installation information proved fruitless.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to Victoria Grand so that firstly Paul et al could talk with him and then Victoria et al could have a word. The connections worked very well. It seems that Beryl had phoned him earlier.</p>
