        <h1>Monday 11th November</h1>
        <p>My intent had been to check the cars today, the MG for the run on Wednesday and the Panda for the trip to High Wyckam on Friday. However, just before three o'clock I started by checking the tyre pressures on the Panda and found that one was only half what it should be. This was the one that we had noticed a slow leak in before. So I pumped it up and went into Worthing. Unfortunately the nail was on the shoulder and so it could not be repaired. A new tyre cost Â£95!</p>
        <p>The plumber arrived at 8:30 and left just before 5pm. We still don't know when it will be done. After an early dinner, Angela went to her WI committee meeting, collecting the lunch club cash on her way. Then after tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington.</p>
