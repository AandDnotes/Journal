        <h1>Wednesday 27th November</h1>
        <p>Generally a rainy day. In fact the rain was quite heavy at times. My intention was to paint the bathroom today. However, I spent nearly all morning dealing with IET and STEM email.</p>
        <p>Angela had taken her WI programme to someone for checking and got trapped by the rain, but before lunch I managed to give the piece of skirting another coat of primer and then after lunch, while Angela was at table tennis, I painted sealer around the edge of the ceiling (and lights). I also did a little filling. It took quite a time just to get things set up to paint. For example, the steps were too high for use in the shower, but the step was too low in the rest of the bathroom.</p>
