        <h1>Friday 29th November</h1>
        <p>A day of outings. As forecast, the day was dry (although there had been some overnight rain) and sunny. Angela went off to meet Carol at a pub at Arundel and a little later I took the TC to Plummers Plain for the WSMGOC pub run. So we both went out for lunch. I got home about three o'clock, having driven 32 miles, and Angela got home half an hour later.</p>
        <p>I also phoned the plumber and found that he is coming on Monday. I did manage to do a little sanding and filling before going out.</p>
