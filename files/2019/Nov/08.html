        <h1>Friday 8th November</h1>
        <p>My only trip outside today was to go to the garage. Angela on the other hand went down to the High Street this morning and to the Methodist church this afternoon to help set up for tomorrow's Christmas fair. I was a little surprised that the flooring man didn't arrive until ten o'clock, but had finished laying the bathroom floor by lunch time. We're not quite sure how we are expected to pay for it.</p>
        <p>I completed my revised family tree and started making notes for that section.</p>
