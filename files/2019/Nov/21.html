        <h1>Thursday 21st November</h1>
        <p>Essentially a standard Thursday. We went off to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then went into Worthing. We bought a couple of books and some Christmas cards before going to Lyons Farm. We had soup for lunch in Sainsbury's and then did the grocery shopping. So we were quite late home.</p>
        <p>After coffee and cake (and a bit of Dutch) Angela went to the High Street and came back without her reading glasses! She went back, but couldn't find them. So I spent a while trying to make the 'broken' arm of her old glasses work better.</p>
