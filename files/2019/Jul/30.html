        <h1>Tuesday 30th July</h1>
        <p>We left the Premier Inn at Worcester just after 8:30 and arrived at Croft Head at 12:30 following just one stop on the motorway (M5 and M6) for coffee. After a light lunch we went for a walk around the valley, getting back just as it was starting to rain. Actually we were quite wet, but soon dried off and the rain came on much heavier. We then spent the rest of the afternoon and evening having dinner and talking.</p>
