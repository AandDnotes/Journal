        <h1>Saturday 6th July</h1>
        <p>A warm, sunny, pleasant day. In fact better than the weather report had forecast. After a late breakfast we set off to Sheffield Park with our picnic items, arriving at about 12:15. We stopped for coffee and then went for a walk around part of the garden before returning to the car park for our picnic, sat in the shade of some trees. After that we went back into the gardens and took a longer walk part the 'big' trees and around the lower lakes. There was a waterlily festival taking place, with many flowers and sculptures on the lakes.</p>
        <p>We were home by about 5:30 and, having had a late lunch, had an even later dinner.</p>
