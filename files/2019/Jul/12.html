        <h1>Friday 12th July</h1>
        <p>We were expecting the YMCA to collect the wardrobes today. However, they phoned just after 12:30 to ask if they could come tomorrow since they were scheduled to be going in the opposite direction today.</p>
        <p>Apart from covering the TC, I spent most of the morning creating, printing and cutting up name labels for next Thursday's social. I also emailed a couple of people regarding that event. Meanwhile, Angela went down to the town and after lunch went for a check-up at the dentist and an appointment at the hygienist. I measured all the windows and doors and entered the dimensions in a spreadsheet and calculated all the areas that will 'leak' heat. Next I will look up the U-value for each different type of area and calculate the total heat loss.</p>
