        <h1>Thursday 11th July</h1>
        <p>It was a fairly normal start to a Thursday. We went off to Victoria Grand, only a little earlier than usual, after I had rearranged Dad's optician's appointment again. After visiting Dad we went into Worthing so that Angela could pay in her WI cash. Luckily Angela remembered that she had a Waitrose voucher as we were driving in, so we went there to do the weekly shop.</p>
        <p>So we were home fairly early and after lunch Angela went to a funeral. A little later I went to Thakeham Primary School to give a Barefoot workshop. There should have been five teachers, but one was sick, the Head was at a safeguarding meeting and the deputy head missed the start and end of the workshop. So only two teachers were there all the time. But it went well and I was home a little after five.</p>
        <p>I sent an email to members of the Sussex Network committee about attending the social next week.</p>
