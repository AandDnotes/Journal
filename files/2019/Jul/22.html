        <h1>Monday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>I was still in my dressing gown when I realised that I should be leaving to go to Horsham to meet with Gregg and later Norman. I was about ten minutes late, but we had time to review the the Sussex Network budget submission. When Norman arrived we reviewed the 'social', which was generally agreed to be a success, apart from the number of members attending. I was home at midday.</p>
        <p>Angela was still out, but when she got home said that she had met Gwen, who was searching for her husband (who has dementia). While I made lunch Angela went out to help try to find him. He was found on his way home.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then went into Worthing to look at the dining room furniture options. I also bought a shirt.</p>
