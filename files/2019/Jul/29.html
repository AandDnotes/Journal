        <h1>Monday 29th July</h1>
        <p>We left home at 9:15 and headed towards Petworth and the A272, which we then followed past Winchester. On the way we stopped at Hinton Ampner for coffee and arrived at Heather and Roberts just after three, with a few wrong turns in Malvern. We left them after eight and found our way to the Premier Inn next to the M5. The day was quite warm and sunny, but there was a little rain in the evening on our way to the hotel.</p>
