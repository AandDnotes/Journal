        <h1>Tuesday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>The day started quite misty, but that was soon burnt off by the sun and it gradually became very hot. I started with a walk to the Hight Street to get my hair cut. We then spent most of the morning trying to sort out online access to the Milkandmore web site. It appeared not to accept a new password, but I think it was simply not updating correctly.</p>
        <p>After lunch I mapped out our route to Malvern. Then Shiela and John called for a 'cup of tea', which was fizzy elderflower and apple because it was so warm. After they left and while Angela cooked dinner, I put up another tool rack, but found that the space for the 'other half' is too small. So it will need to be cut in half and placed further over.</p>
        <p>Between eight and nine thirty, while trying to watch catch-up TV, the broadband connection failed several times!</p>
