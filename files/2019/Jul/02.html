        <h1>Tuesday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by loading rubbish into the car and taking it to the tip in East Worthing. It was very busy. From there we went to the tyre shop. The rear nearside tyre was still leaking slightly. They couldn't find a puncture, but cleaned the rim and put in a new valve. We will see how it develops</p>
        <p>While waiting for the car we walked into Worthing to have coffee and buy a few things. Then we went to Shoreham to Dunelm to exchange the valance, since we had found before we left that the one we had bought was too long.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch I finished clearing a space in the garage and we moved the parts of one wardrobe from the dining room. I managed to put it together apart from one of the doors.</p>
