        <h1>Tuesday 16th July</h1>
        <p>I had an unexpected trip to Storrington this morning. Angela was taking the bus to pay in her WI cash and I walked with her on my way to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription. On the way she suggested that I went on the bus with her. So I did. When we got back Angela went to the butchers and i went to the health centre, but I could not make an appointment to see a doctor about two skin 'spots'.</p>
        <p>When we got home I found that Julie Hudson was ill and would not be coming to the social. So I spent time emailing people and finding pdf versions of some of the flyers that I have ordered in case they do not arrive. Later I went to the stationers in Steyning and bought a pack of name labels to which I can glue my printed labels.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to Furniture Village in Portslade to look at tables and chairs. So we didn't really achieve anything today.</p>
