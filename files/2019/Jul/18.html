        <h1>Thursday 18th July</h1>
        <p>A very busy day. We started by going to Victoria Grand, a little earlier than usual, and then went on to do the weekly shop at Sainsbury's. As a result we were home quite early to cook lunch, after which I went to the hygienist.</p>
        <p>Much to my surprise, the package from the IET arrived at 3:15, half an hour before I left for Crawley.</p>
        <p>From 4:30 we set up the room at the football stadium. It all went very well. It would have been nice to have more people, but there was a good atmosphere and a good amount of interest in what we were doing. I was home at 5 o'clock.</p>
