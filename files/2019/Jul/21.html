        <h1>Sunday 21st July</h1>
        <p>A fairly standard Sunday. Angela went off to church and I reviewed Greg's budget and drafted the final sheet. After lunch we spoke with Paul and Krista (Rowan only appeared to say goodbye). Afterwards I went into the garage and started putting the tool hangers on the wall.</p>
