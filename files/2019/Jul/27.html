        <h1>Saturday 27th July</h1>
        <p>Today I was due to take the TC to the Sidlesham fete. However, it rained all night and was still raining this morning, so I texted David to say that I would not be going. I did the weekly accounts instead and continued drafting an article for Main Gear, although the rain did stop just after lunch. So Angela did some planting and shredding.</p>
        <p>We had a call from Linda Ottiwell inviting us for lunch on Thursday. So I then booked a hotel for Thursday night at Walsall and retrieved the cases from the loft.</p>
