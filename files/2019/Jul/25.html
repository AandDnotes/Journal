        <h1>Thursday 25th July</h1>
        <p>We started the day by walking down to the Health Centre, Angela to collect more batteries for her hearing aids and me to see the doctor about skin spots. Angela got a months-worth of batteries, but I needed to make anther appointment to have the spots 'frozen' off. Angela then went to the butchers.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning, Hamish called for me and we drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Brighton. We went to the Sussex University Engineering School awards. It was held in the basement of a pub in Brighton, so was dark and noisy. And the IET recipient was not there! I was home at about 4:20.</p>
