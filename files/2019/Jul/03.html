        <h1>Tuesday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>Another busy day, although it did not go quite according to plan. While Angela went walking with he WI friends I planned to finish the monthly accounts. However, while I was putting the second door on the wardrobe in the garage a BT man called. he said that a battery had been found that was getting wet and causing a problem, but he would check the line from our main box (on the front wall of the house), back to the exchange. He found that the wires were exposed going into the box and decided to lower it. One of the wires broke as he touched it and so he used a second pair within the cable. Perhaps this will solve the problem.</p>
        <p>So I spent the rest of the morning printing things for the IET social (which meant fitting new cartridges) and sending an update to Greg and Norman.</p>
        <p>After lunch the window men came. They replaced the locking mechanism on the bedroom window (the gear box had split) and replaced the wheels in the patio door (which now runs smoothly). The we moved the parts of the other wardrobe into the garage and I assembled it. I also emptied two more boxes.</p>
        <p>After dinner I mailed Russel about our trip to/from Gatwick and mailed Robert about visiting them on our way to the Lake District.</p>
