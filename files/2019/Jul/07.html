        <h1>Sunday 7th July</h1>
        <p>There was significant rainfall overnight and it was still drizzling this morning. So thoughts of taking a walk around Shoreham were not feasible. In any case, Kate and Dick planned to leave after breakfast so as to stop at High Wycombe to buy a clock.</p>
        <p>We had a late breakfast and so it was nearly 11 o'clock before they left. We thought that we could then start catching up, but we were tired and so didn't really do much. However we did talk with firstly Paul et al and then Victoria.</p>
