        <h1>Tuesday 9th July</h1>
        <p>My morning was spent at Greg's in Horsham to meet with him and Norman about our social event. Hopefully all is under control. We just need to get people to attend!</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went in search of sandals, and came back with both sandals and a cardigan! Meanwhile I refreshed my memory on the Barefoot slides since I have a workshop on Thursday. I then drafted the final email to IET Sussex members and asked Julie Hudson for some help. I also took the cover off the TC and lowered the hood in preparation for tomorrow. It sounds as thought the weather will be fine.</p>
