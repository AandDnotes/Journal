        <h1>Monday 1st July</h1>
        <p>A normal Monday morning start by going to Victoria Grand, but at least it was another fine summer's day. Since Angela was going out to lunch at twelve, we were home fairly early.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I did some more sorting out in the garage. Although I still have ten boxes to empty, I'm almost at the point where I have room to assemble the wardrobes.</p>
        <p>Later I started doing the monthly accounts.</p>
