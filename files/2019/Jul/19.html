        <h1>Friday 19th July</h1>
        <p>Today centred around going out for lunch. While Angela went to the butchers I emailed the IET Sussex committee about the social and then put some wax on the TC. We then took it to Bolney to meet up with other members of the WSMGOC. It started drizzling as we left and continued for the rest of the day! However, we had a good meal and chat, arriving home at 3:15. So I dried the car as best I could.</p>
        <p>During the evening our broadband connection failed for a while and a speed test showed that download was only 1 Mbps! Earlier in the day I had received a text from TalkTalk saying that they had fixed the earlier problem. So I then spent about 40 minutes on the phone while they tested the line, confirmed that there was a fault and submitted a request for an engineer to investigate it. The person I spoke to was in Thailand and it seemed that it takes quite a few minutes to submit a 'ticket' after it has been completed. The result is that an engineer will investigate and I will get a call back between 6-9 on Thursday to check that the problem has been resolved. Perhaps it has something to do with the rain!</p>
