        <h1>Wednesday 10th July</h1>
        <p>The day started with me rearranging, yet again, Dad's eye test appointment. This time to make it earlier so that he and we can go to the family meeting being held at Victoria Grand on Saturday. Then it was off in the TC for me and off walking for Angela.</p>
        <p>Angela's walking group went to Slindon, while I went to Lyminster to pick up David F-B. They had some German visitors who were interested in seeing the TC. We then set off for the Cricketer's pub in Duncton. After quite a long coffee break we set off for West Dean College, arriving about one o'clock after only a 20 mile run.</p>
        <p>The college is encased in scaffolding as they replace the whole roof. We met in a wood-panelled hall, queued for our drinks and tehn for our buffet lunch. There was plenty of choice and plenty of food. If we'd wanted we could get a sticker that would allow us to explore the gardens, but David and I left for home (his home).</p>
        <p>On the way the low-fuel light came on. I checked for fuel leaks when we got to David's and then stopped at a BP garage to get some fuel. I then arrived home at four o'clock, having done a total of 92 miles.</p>
        <p>I then prepared and printed a couple of blank direction signs and started creating a set of name badges for committee members.</p>
