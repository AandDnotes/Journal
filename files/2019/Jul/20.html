        <h1>Saturday 20th July</h1>
        <p>The day started grey with occasional drizzle, but brightened up around midday and turned into a fine, sunny afternoon, if a little breezy. I walked to the newsagents before we set off in the TC for the Lyminster fete. We arrived at 11:30 as requested to find no space to park amongst the classic cars, so we started a second row. After another short shower we went off to look around and have a cup of tea before spending quite a long time wandering around the church trying to answer their 'treasure hunt'. We couldn't even find some of the question cards!</p>
        <p>I also spent some time talking with other car owners, particularly the owner of an Austin 7 van. He had bought a chassis and a few bits and spent 11 years finding the rest and putting it together. It was a nice little vehicle.</p>
        <p>We were home at 4:20 and spoke with Victoria.</p>
