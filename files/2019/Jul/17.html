        <h1>Wednesday 17th July</h1>
        <p>Being Wednesday, Angela went off this morning with her WI walking friends. They walked down the river to Shoreham and then caught the bus back. Meanwhile I printed the remaining things that are needed for the social, in case the flyers that I ordered do not arrive in time. They need to come tomorrow or they will be too late.</p>
        <p>I then moved into the garage and looked at the plugs and points of the TC. the plugs in the front two cylinders were a little sooty, but those in cylinders three and four were very sooty. So I cleaned them and adjusted the gaps. I also checked the points gap.</p>
        <p>The next job was to check the fuel levels in the carburetters, so, after tightening the bolts that hold the float chambers to the body, I removed the tops and pistons. It appeared that the fuel level in the rear carburetter was too low and that in the front carburetter too high. However, this is contrary to the evidence from the plugs. In the end I decided that I didn't have time today, so I put it all back and checked that the car would start (which it did). As I cleaned the car I noticed that the fuel sender unit is leaking again! What I didn't get done was to put wax on the panels.</p>
        <p>When I put the dishwasher on I discovered that the washing machine water hose connection was leaking! So we cleared it out and mopped up the water. It will be Friday before I can look at it.</p>
