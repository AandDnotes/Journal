        <h1>Friday 5th July</h1>
        <p>The morning was mostly spent preparing for our visitors, however, I managed to do the weekly accounts and get an email out to the IET Sussex committee about the Brighton prize giving. Although warm, it was not the expected sunny day and Kate and Dick arrived just after one o'clock. So it was 4:30 before we sat down for coffee after dinner! However, we did then take them for an 'orientation' walk down to the High Street and back. Then it was more talking and a late tea.</p>
