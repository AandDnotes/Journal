        <h1>Monday 8th July</h1>
        <p>After Angela went down to the High Street we went to Victoria Grand as usual on a Monday. That was followed by a trip into Worthing to get a couple of items for the social. After lunch Angela had a WI committee meeting. Meanwhile, I did a few jobs in the garage and on the TC, including tightening connections on the carburetters to stop fuel leaks.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington. There were about 35 people there and I didn't get a seat.</p>
