        <h1>Monday 15th July</h1>
        <p>We started our trip to Victoria Grand by calling in to the Greenhouse to see if they had a dining table, but they didn't. So after our visit to Dad we called into the YMCA, but they didn't have a suitable one either. However, they did have two ash wardrobes, one of which had already been sold for Â£99!</p>
        <p>After coffee (and buying another set of garage shelves) we looked at tables in the two furniture shops in Worthing.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I worked int eh garage. I fixed an old set of plastic shelves to the wall, made up the new set and fixed that to the wall on the other side. I also fixed the old kitchen cabinet to the wall next to the new shelves.</p>
