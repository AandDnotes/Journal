        <h1>Wednesday 24th July</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela went walking with her WI friends, although, since it was hot, they only walked as far as the cafe! Meanwhile, I checked Greg's spending predictions and mailed him. Then I finished fixing my tool racks to the wall in the garage. I had to cut the original single batten into three pieces.</p>
        <p>Later we had and early bite to eat and then drove to Chichester theatre to see Oklahoma. The traffic was light, but that gave us time to sit and have a coffee before the performance. During the first act all went quiet and the stage manager came on stage and said they had a technical problem with one of their automated scene moves. After five minutes they rearranged the scene manually and continued. The whole performance was quite entertaining. However, on the way home we found that the A27 was closed for road repairs and we were diverted down the A259 and then back up the A29 to Fontwell. So it took some time to get home, with us arriving at about 11:30.</p>
