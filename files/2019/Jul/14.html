        <h1>Sunday 14th July</h1>
        <p>A fairly normal Sunday. Angela went to church and I spent most of the morning working on the accounts. I couldn't find the cause of the discrepancy between the statement and my spreadsheet. I then completed the monthly accounts and retrieved the share notices from the past two months.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was disturbed by the men's final at Wimbledon. We ended up having dinner in front of the TV. Prior to that we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
