        <h1>Wednesday 31st July</h1>
        <p>After a good night's sleep at the very quiet Croft Head we were driven by Richard to Elterwater, for a gentle walk (about four miles), stopping for coffee in the process. Luckily it stayed dry, but started raining when we got back. After lunch we sat and read newspapers before going to a hotel above Windermere for a fine dinner. The chef had obtained a Michelin star at his previous restaurant.</p>
