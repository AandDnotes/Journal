        <h1>Thursday 4th July</h1>
        <p>It may have been the US Independence Day (and the day on which Victoria et al are travelling home from Missouri), but for us today was all about grocery shopping for the weekend. We were fairly early at Victoria Grand and soon set off for Waitrose in Worthing. After taking some things to a charity shop we hunted for interesting picnic food. But we didn't find any. So then it was off to Sainsbury's for a fairly major shop.</p>
        <p>Angela then spent most of the afternoon cooking for the weekend (and for dinner) while I dusted and vacuumed throughout. Luckily it was a warm, sunny day, so we could have all the windows and the patio door open.</p>
