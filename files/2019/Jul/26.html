        <h1>Friday 26th July</h1>
        <p>We pretended that today was Thursday! Since I was out yesterday we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then did our weekly shop. We called in to Worthing and ordered our dining room furniture and went to Waitrose to buy some Sussex (and Surrey) wine to take with us on Monday.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela went down to Steyning and then worked in the garden. I checked over the TC and 'pottered' in the garage. We had bought a gutted trout in Waitrose which was in a paper bag with butter and herbs. We simply put it in the oven. We had to remove the head and tail and then get the flesh off the bones. It was a bit messy, but tasty.</p>
