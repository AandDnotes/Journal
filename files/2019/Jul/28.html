        <h1>Sunday 28th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the usual backups and checked the Panda prior to tomorrow's journey. I also put the cover on the TC. When Angela got home we left straight away for Lyminster and the WSMGOC barbecue. We were the last to arrive, but it turned out to be a fine, warm day. There was plenty of food and good chat.</p>
        <p>We got home just after four and talked with Paul and Rowan. We then packed a couple of bags, ready for the morning.</p>
