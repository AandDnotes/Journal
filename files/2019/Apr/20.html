        <h1>Saturday 20th April</h1>
        <p>Another hot and sunny day. We didn't do a lot of sorting/packing, but while Angela walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper, I finished cutting the grass at Rosemary Avenue. We then did a little sorting/packing, Angela in the sitting room and me in the garage, although I did also clean the main oven glass door.</p>
        <p>After lunch in the garden we showered and went to the Victoria Grand Easter party. We parked in Grand Avenue, thinking that the forecourt would be full, but it actually had at least three spaces! Dad and most of the other residents were already in the dining room (we assume that the large conservatory was too hot) and a singer was waiting to start. She spent an hour singing popular songs of the 50s, 60s and 70s and the staff served small glasses of Pims and cakes part-way through.</p>
        <p>When the singer had finished we went to Dad's room, where we found a letter asking us to make an appointment for Dad at the hospital, although it seems that he has not had a re-occurrence of blood in his urine. But we will make an appointment, just to check. We left at five, so there was little time to do anything before dinner.</p>
