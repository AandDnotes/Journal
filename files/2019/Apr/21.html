        <h1>Sunday 21st April</h1>
        <p>Easter Sunday, so Angela went to church this morning while I did the usual updates, backups and accounts. I also installed a new version of essential OS. Then it was time to pack away the stereo system in the sitting room.</p>
        <p>So after lunch in the garden (it was even hotter today and just a clear blue sky) we removed the boxes from the sitting room wall. The battens took a little longer to remove and I now have to fill the holes. We then spent over an hour talking with Victoria (or mainly her talking to us).</p>
