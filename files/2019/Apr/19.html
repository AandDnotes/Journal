        <h1>Friday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Both Good Friday and Angela's birthday. And it was a gloriously sunny and warm day.</p>
        <p>We started at Rosemary Avenue, cutting some of the grass, but the mower has developed a rattle! So I will look at it tomorrow and, hopefully, finish cutting the grass. After that, I retrieved the empty boxes from the end loft, ready for packing up the iMac and stereos.</p>
        <p>Since the weather was so fine and it was Angela's birthday we took a drive to Shoreham. There we walked along the new footpath next to the river (and past the house boats), over the Ferry Bridge and had lunch in a patisserie, before walking back to the car via the beach.</p>
        <p>later, Paul and Rowan called to wish Angela a Happy Birthday.</p>
