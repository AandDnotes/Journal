        <h1>Saturday 13th April</h1>
        <p>We started by loading the car with stuff for the Oxfam shop. Luckily we could park in the centre of Steyning and so didn't have too far to carry the boxes and bags. We were then able to pick up a newspaper.</p>
        <p>Angela then spent the morning and part of the afternoon sorting out the content of the greenhouse. Meanwhile I continued packing up the study, removing the notice board and shelves from the wall.</p>
        <p>We were expecting to talk with Victoria, but they were up early so as to go to the University's 'open day'. So more sorting out!</p>
