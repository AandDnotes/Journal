        <h1>Thursday 25th April</h1>
        <p>We did the necessary grocery shopping and visited Dad yesterday, so we didn't need to go out today. However, Angela walked to Steyning twice, early so as to get new batteries for her hearing aids and post birthday parcels to Rowan and Austin and then again later to take more things to a charity shop.</p>
        <p>Angela also did some sorting out of cupboards in the hall and vacuumed around. I finished clearing and 'packing' in the garage and struggled changing address at a number of places. The bank was easy (although they really wanted to know after you had moved), mbna wanted a form posted, DVLA for our driving licences took a lot of effort and Horsham (council tax) was also done.</p>
