        <h1>Sunday 7th April</h1>
        <p>In addition to the usual backups and updates, today was all about sorting out more things. While Angela was at church I 'repaired' the 'bits and pieces' boxes that were given to me by Brian Yates. So now they are ready to be moved.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela finished emptying the dresser and the wardrobe and I removed the second set of steel shelving in the garage and dismantled it. So now it is destined for the metal skip at Shoreham tip.</p>
        <p>In the middle we spoke with Paul (Rowan only said hello and goodbye).</p>
