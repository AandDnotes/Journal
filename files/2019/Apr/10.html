        <h1>Wednesday 10th April</h1>
        <p>Whereas yesterday was mostly rainy, today was dry and, in the afternoon, sunny. So it was a good day to take the TC for a run. The Sussex Wanderers met at Barnes Green for coffee and then did a good 25+ mile run to Colegate, via Ashington, Ashurst, Maplehurst and Mannings Heath. After a good lunch I drove home, arriving just before three o'clock. The TC and I drove a total of 74 miles.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her last table tennis session of the season. Later I went into the garage and cleaned the trays that normally sit under the TC.</p>
