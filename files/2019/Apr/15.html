        <h1>Monday 15th April</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He seemed fine, but we later had a phone call from them to say that, over the weekend, he had passed blood, more than once. The 111 operator said they should make an appointment for hem to see his GP. He came today and gave Dad the option of waiting to see how it progressed or seeing someone at the hospital. Dad deferred the decision to me. So we said we should see how it is tomorrow. They will ask him to pee in a jug, since he forgets and flushes the toilet.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting, a talk on Barbados, while I started by looking at the Dansette record player. The valves glow and the motor turns, but the turntable spindle seems to be seized (probably by solidified oil).</p>
        <p>I then emptied the draws in the study and removed the doors from the wardrobe in the spare bedroom.</p>
