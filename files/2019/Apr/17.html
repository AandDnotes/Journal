        <h1>Wednesday 17th April</h1>
        <p>The morning was all about taking rubbish to the Shoreham tip. Although we also called into B&amp;Q to get some 'jubilee clips' and some surface filler. Angela also checked on Rosemary Avenue and I finished filling the holes in the study walls.</p>
        <p>We did some more sorting out after lunch before I went to Falmer to an IET talk on methods of incorporating micro generators into the power distribution network.</p>
