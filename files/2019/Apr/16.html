        <h1>Tuesday 16th April</h1>
        <p>The BHF furniture collectors arrived at nine o'clock this morning, but they didn't want the wardrobe! So I emailed the Renovated Furniture Group, but they didn't want it either. Having checked that the wardrobe can be dismantled, it is now advertised on Freecycle and we have our fingers crossed.</p>
        <p>Angela caught the bus to Storrington so as to bank her WI cash while I dismantled the modelling bench and removed the light and power strip. Then the power strip and lamp over the desk came off the wall. A little later I made my first attempt at filling all the holes. I will need to get some fine surface filler to try to make the surface smooth. Meanwhile Angela sorted out rubbish from the bottom shed.</p>
        <p>We also had a call from Victoria Grand to say that Dad was still passing blood in his urine. So they are to ask the GP to refer him to the hospital. I phoned Alan to keep him informed.</p>
