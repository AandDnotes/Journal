        <h1>Friday 26th April</h1>
        <p>We were wondering how to tell the window cleaner that we are moving. Luckily they came today. After that we loaded the car (again) with rubbish and took it to the Shoreham tip. No queues this time.</p>
        <p>Angela did some more sorting and took some things to a charity shop. I painted the spots in the kitchen. Emmaus called after lunch for the pieces of furniture they had agreed to take. I had phoned to add the two wardrobes, but they were too heavy for them! However, they did take a bed, an armchair, the pew, a nest of tables, a plant stand and the hall table. Ben at Osbourne Humphreys asked the Baxters if they wanted the wardrobes. They already have bedroom furniture, but said we could leave them if we wanted. However, I thought it would be easy to dismantle them, so we decided to take them with us. I then spent the rest of the day dismantling one of them. They are very heavy and it took a while to work out how to take them apart. However, they then don't take up much space.</p>
