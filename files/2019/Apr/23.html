        <h1>Tuesday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>Forecast to be the last of the warm days, it was overcast and humid. We were quite late getting going, but Angela went down to Steyning and I sanded the filled holes in the sitting room and put on some fine filler. They don't seem to need paining, since it is hard to see them. I also replied to the IET about the banners and branded tablecloths that the Sussex Network need replacing.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took more things to a charity shop and bought small, post-able presents for Austin and Rowan, along with some birthday cards. I had previously removed the bedroom mirror from the wall, so I removed the plugs and put some filler in the holes. While Angela cleared out the sheds, I pulled out the bench and cleaned behind and underneath it. I also started removing things from the cupboard above the bench and then loaded more rubbish into the car, ready for a trip to the tip in the morning.</p>
