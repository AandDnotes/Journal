        <h1>Thursday 18th April</h1>
        <p>Since we are going to the Victoria Grand Easter party on Saturday we decided not to visit Dad today. So we just went to Sainsbury's to do the weekly groceries shop, which was not large since we are trying not to add to the things that will need to be moved. Therefore we were home quite early and were able to do some more 'sorting' before lunch.</p>
        <p>My sorting involved painting the filled holes in the study walls. However, I had no paint of the right colour, and some others were mouldy in the pots. So I put some white paint on them, which makes them look worse! Meanwhile Angel started emptying the teak boxes in the sitting room.</p>
        <p>After lunch in the garden, sat in the sunshine, Angela went down to Steyning and I waited for the person who answered the Freegle ad and was interested in the wardrobe. I then spent the rest of the afternoon dismantling it, just in time for them to collect it.</p>
