        <h1>Tuesday 9th April</h1>
        <p>Contracts were exchanged today! Even though it was at about four o'clock. Ben told us that the stair lift will be removed, but the le Tissiers were upset that we asked for the washing machine and dishwasher removed after they had brought a van along over the weekend. So we said that we would dispose of the machines and they will leave all the curtains and blinds.</p>
        <p>As it happens, Ben is moving into a new flat and would like the washing machine. So he agreed to remove them if he could leave them in the garage until he can get agreement to take them to his new garage. He will make a donation to charity.</p>
        <p>After Angela Payne phoned to say that contracts had been exchanged and the completion date confirmed as April 30th, I phoned Saga, the house insurance provider, and arranged for Penlands Vale to be insured between now and the completion date. Surprisingly it did not cost anything!</p>
        <p>This morning Sandy and John called and took away one of the book cases, which we had emptied and unscrewed from the wall. They could just get it in the back of their car, with the tailgate slightly open. The removal firm also brought some boxes and tape and later two hanging rails for us to use when we have sold the wardrobes. I also checked the tyres on the MG and removed the cover, ready for the morning, and did just a little more tidying in the garage.</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning before breakfast to get some milk, since the milkman had not delivered. Then she went down again to get her hair cut, then again to post a letter.</p>
