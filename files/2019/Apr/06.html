        <h1>Saturday 6th April</h1>
        <p>This morning we walked to Steyning to buy a newspaper, but took with us some things for the Oxfam shop, including the rocking horse that I made, what must have been 40 years ago. It was a shame to see it go.</p>
        <p>Then it was weekly and monthly accounts time, which took most of the rest of the morning. After lunch it was time to get back to sorting things out, Angela in the dining room (the dresser is now empty) and in the back spare bedroom, and me in the garage.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria and Austin, with a few words from Juniper, for about an hour. I also finished migrating my TC4985 'outings' entries to the new structure using a grid to define the various parts of the web page.</p>
