        <h1>Monday 1st April</h1>
        <p>A busier day. We started by going to Victoria Grand earlier than usual. Dad was still had his breakfast tray in front of him. But we were able to get home, have a quick coffee and drop Angela off in Steyning with more stuff for a charity shop, as I went off to Crawley to meet Greg at the Crawley football club stadium. We saw the function room that we could rent, with its view over the playing pitch.</p>
        <p>I was home by midday and after an early lunch walked down to Steyning to get my hear cut, but the barbers was temporarily closed (until 3 o'clock). So I walked home, however, I had carried down some books.</p>
        <p>The man from Helliers arrived on time and took just over half an hour to look around. He will email the quote.</p>
        <p>I then spent a lot of time trying to get the Bluetooth connection to the iMac's mouse and keyboard working after having the mouse plugged in to charge it. I tried various things, but after leaving it for a while the keyboard worked and then the mouse after switching it off and on.</p>
