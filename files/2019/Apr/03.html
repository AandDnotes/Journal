        <h1>Wednesday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>A tiring day without actually doing a lot. We booked the removal firm with packing on Monday 29th April and the actual move on the 30th. We told the solicitor of our required completion date. Angela did more sorting out in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I went to a school in Lindfield to run a Barefoot workshop for ten staff. It seemed to go well, but with the drive there and back was quite tiring.</p>
