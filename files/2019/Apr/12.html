        <h1>Friday 12th April</h1>
        <p>Another bright day, but a bit colder, with an easterly wind. So we did our sorting/packing indoors. After going to the doctor's to talk about her cholesterol level, Angela worked on the dining room cupboard and I worked in the study. Before that I put an ad on Friday Ad for our wardrobes. Then I cleared both the corner shelves and the lorry, but only removed the former from the wall.</p>
        <p>In the evening we went to the Fish Factory and used our voucher from Jacob Steel.</p>
