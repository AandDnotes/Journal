        <h1>Monday 8th April</h1>
        <p>There was quite a lot going on today. I went to Victoria Grand on my own, while Angela stayed home since the 'Recycled Furniture Group' people were due to arrive between 10am and 2pm to collect the dresser and table/chairs. In fact they arrived early and had already loaded up when I arrived home. They also took the green upholstered chair.</p>
        <p>Around midday, Angela went to the lunch club, to wash up, and then went on to a WI committee meeting. After lunch, Ben brought Mr Baxter and a friend (who I assumed was a builder) around to look at a few things. He said that completion on the 30th was fine and they were expecting to exchange contracts immediately. Angela Payne phoned a couple of times, initially with a proposal for a different completion date! She then emailed to say that she was still waiting to hear about the removal of the stair lift.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I went into the garage to do more clearing and packing. When Angela returned I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington.</p>
