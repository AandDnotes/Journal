        <h1>Tuesday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>I managed to get my hair cut this morning. We carried a number of books and other things down to Steyning to a charity shop and then I went to the barbers.</p>
        <p>After lunch we were visited by a second removal firm. Both firms provided a quotation this evening.</p>
        <p>I also worked through the Barefoot slides again and later in the day I drove to Crawley for an IET talk on radar systems.</p>
