        <h1>Wednesday 24th April</h1>
        <p>To our surprise there was a queue at Shoreham tip this morning. So it took us a while to dispose of our load. We then called into Lidle to get a few groceries, avoiding the need to go out tomorrow.</p>
        <p>From there, we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He didn't look well and soon became dizzy and nauseous. A carer took his blood pressure and temperature, which were fine. However, he was then sick, and it seems that he is on antibiotics for a urinary infection. The staff called the doctor, who said rest for 48 hours. When we left he was having soup, bread and butter and fruit salad for his lunch in his room.</p>
        <p>When I phoned later in the day he had been down for supper and was feeling better. I am due to take him to Worthing hospital for scans on Monday.</p>
        <p>After lunch I told Southern Water of our change of address and sorted out my collection of wood and rods in the garage. I also removed the notice board and key hooks in the kitchen, filling the holes.</p>
