        <h1>Monday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>A day spent mainly sorting out and cutting grass. Angela cut the front grass and the major part of the back before lunch, while I cleaned around the fridge in the garage and started clearing out the draws under the bench. I completed that after lunch and then finished cutting the grass.</p>
        <p>In between we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
