        <h1>Sunday 14th April</h1>
        <p>Our break from sorting/packing was, this afternoon, to firstly talk with Paul/Rowan and then with Victoria. Of course, Angela also went to church this morning.</p>
        <p>I removed the 'lorry' from the study wall and removed all the wall plugs (including an amount of plaster). Then I managed to get the aircraft, balsa and plans in the TC. After dinner I cleaned out the dish washer. It should have been done months ago!</p>
