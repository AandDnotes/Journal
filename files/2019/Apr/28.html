        <h1>Sunday 28th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the usual backups, finished taking things down from the garage ceiling above the TC and then un-plumbed firstly the dish washer and then the washing machine. That took longer than I had expected, so I finished it after lunch.</p>
        <p>Paul et al were at Greet's birthday party, so we spoke to them quite late, after talking with Victoria (also quite late). Consequently we had a late dinner (fish again). We were tired by bedtime, but more or less ready for the packers tomorrow morning.</p>
