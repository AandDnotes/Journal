        <h1>Saturday 27th April</h1>
        <p>This morning was all about dismantling the second wardrobe. However, a call from Victoria Grand revealed that Dad had pains in his abdomen. They had given him paracetamol and we agreed that they should call the doctor. Later (around 5:30) we found that Dad was feeling better, although he had his tea in his room. They were still waiting for the out-of-hours doctor to phone!</p>
        <p>After dismantling the wardrobe we did a tour of the Close, having a quick chat with each of the residents, although we went into Mel's and had a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Then, before dinner, I removed most of the things in the centre of the garage roof above the TC.</p>
