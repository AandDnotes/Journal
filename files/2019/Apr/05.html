        <h1>Friday 5th April</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. We took some items to the charity shop on our way to Penlands Vale to check that the house is OK. We reminded ourselves just how small the rooms are (and the two patches of garden).</p>
        <p>We then took a car load of 'rubbish' to the tip and took a lot of paints, etc. to Rosemary Avenue so that they don't need to be moved by the removal firm.</p>
        <p>We then spent the afternoon sorting things out. Angela emptied most of the dresser and I did more work int eh garage.</p>
