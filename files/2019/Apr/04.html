        <h1>Thursday 4th April</h1>
        <p>A typical Thursday, but with a few twists due to the house move. So we started at Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then went on to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm, before going on to the Dog's Trust at Shoreham to drop off two dog guards and some blankets.</p>
        <p>When we got home we found that the Baxters have asked to visit on Monday, before contracts are exchanged. So we arranged to do the same at Penlands Vale. We also arranged for the BHF to call on Friday of next week to view the furniture we want to give away. Since they would not take the dining chairs, we arranged for the Recycled Goods Factory to take the dresser and table/chairs on Monday.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I did some more sorting in the garage and Angela sorted paperwork for Rosemary Avenue and went round there to check it.</p>
