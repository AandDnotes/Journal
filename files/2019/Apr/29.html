        <h1>Monday 29th April</h1>
        <p>The packers arrived at eight o'clock! Four pleasant young men spent until about 3pm packing most of our things, even those that we didn't want packed, such as potatoes and custard powder. Although it was really because we forgot to ask them to leave them out. I went round removing picture hooks, which resulted in the need to do just a little filling.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch (prepared and eaten in the sitting room) I went to Victoria Grand to pick up Dad and take him to Worthing Hospital. He had an ultrasound scan of his bladder and kidneys. Then we went to the endoscopy department, but the doctors decided that Dad had a urinary infection and it could make matters worse if they did the procedure. So they prescribed a one week course of antibiotics and will make another appointment. We were back at Victoria Grand at around four o'clock.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Angela had been to Steyning to get some potatoes and broccoli for dinner.</p>
