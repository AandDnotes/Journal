        <h1>Wednesday 13th February</h1>
        <p>A fine, warm and mainly sunny day in what is forecast to be a dry week. In spite of the weather, Angela was the only one to venture out, to hang out and bring in washing and to go to her weekly table tennis.</p>
        <p>During the morning I wrote out the process for setting up schools activities and sent it to Gavin and Ramon, since they seem to have forgotten to close the loop with STEM Sussex. Then I spent most of the afternoon setting up cover, table of contents and page web pages.</p>
