        <h1>Monday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Being Monday we made our usual visit to Victoria Grand, early enough to get back for an early lunch  so that Angela could go to her WI meeting. We showed Dad photos of Austin and Juniper and of Rowan and Flo.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I made another bonnet prop and set up the trickle charger. Then put the cover over the car. I then spent quite a long time finding 'Streetview' images of house in which I have lived.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I went to Bernard's in Shoreham for an IET events committee meeting. We ate curry and finished quite late.</p>
