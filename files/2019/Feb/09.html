        <h1>Saturday 9th February</h1>
        <p>We took two walks today. Firstly we walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper, having to go up to Nissa. Then, just before lunch, we walked up Sopers Lane, part way to the top. We went on that second walk because we had another viewing at 12:30. This was a couple from Storrington who had sold (subject to contract) their house. So Ben was quite excited about this viewing. It seems that they were accompanied by Jan from the Shoreham office and the feedback was that it went well, whatever that means.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria, who seemed even more animated than usual. This was probably due to her friend Carol having stayed with them until this morning, when Brandon took her to the airport.</p>
