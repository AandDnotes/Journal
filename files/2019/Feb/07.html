        <h1>Thursday 7th February</h1>
        <p>We started the day with an exciting trip to the Shoreham tip! We collected a few things from Rosemary Avenue on the way and then went on to Victoria Grand. We were home well in time to cook dinner. After lunch Angela went to Rosemary Avenue again to collect more papers for sorting and shredding. Meanwhile I removed the springs from the old roller blind dowels and used one as a prop for the TC's bonnet. With one side of the bonnet up I was then able to connect the trickle charger.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we had a second viewing from a family in Shoreham. They seem very keen, but are waiting to get an offer on their house.</p>
        <p>Then I went to Ricardo to a joint IET/IMechE talk on busses. It was given by a manager from the Reading Bus Company. He was a good speaker and it was an interesting and entertaining talk.</p>e
