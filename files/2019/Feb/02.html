        <h1>Sunday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>We had a slightly extended walk this morning, since both the Beeding newsagent and the petrol station had run out of Telegraphs. However, Nisa Local had plenty. We were not very early setting off (Angela says I take too much time getting ready) and after a chat with Kirsty in number 7 as we arrived home it was nearly eleven when we got in.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was spent dealing with IET business and doing the weekly and monthly accounts. Angela continued sorting through old photos. We also talked with Victoria. They decided not to attempt to go to the mountains since there was a severe weather warning. They had bought some snow chains, but might try again next week. Austin was quite upset that they couldn't go.</p>
