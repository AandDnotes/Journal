        <h1>Sunday 10th February</h1>
        <p>A quiet but busy day, without straying far from the study. I closed a Virgin Money account and openned a Post Office bond. We also, after speaking with Paul et al, booked flights from Gatwick to Schiphol, along with parking, having looked at the Eurostar and Hook of Holand ferry. However, in order to arrive in time to go to Rowan's swimming lesson, we decided catch the early flight; leaving at 06:50!</p>
