        <h1>Saturday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>Although it started slightly misty, it was sunny from the start and during the day became quite warm. We started with a walk to the Beeding newsagents and then just before 11:30 we drove to West Grindstead station. This is a disused station, now on the Downs Link. We parked the car and walked for about 50 minutes to the Southwater Country Park, where we ate the lunch that we had taken. After buying and drinking coffee we walked back to West Grinstead and drove home. Our main reason for going out was because we had another viewing at one o'clock today. It seems that the lady wants to bring her husband to see the house on Monday. In fact, they will come immediately after another couple (who have made a low offer) are here again.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria and Austin (briefly). Juniper also said goodbye!</p>
