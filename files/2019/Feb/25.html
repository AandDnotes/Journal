        <h1>Monday 25th February</h1>
        <p>Another day of wall-to-wall sunshine and, being Monday, we started by going to Victoria Grand. Dad was waiting for a nurse to see him about removing his catheter. Otherwise he seemed well. They hope to have agreement on what needs to be done to get the lift working in the next few days. On our way home we had a new strap fitted to Dad's watch.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the front and half of the rear grass and Angela did some tidying in the garden. We then went for a walk so that two second viewings could take place, half an hour apart.</p>
