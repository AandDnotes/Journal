        <h1>Friday 8th February</h1>
        <p>I finished writing my notes on the steering box modifications and uploaded it.</p>
        <p>Just before midday we went off to the Dogs Trust in Shoreham to deliver a collection of towels. Then on to the tip to dispose of more stuff, before going to Holmbush. We started with lunch in M&amp;S and then toured Tesco to get our weekly groceries and the food for the lunch club. When we got home we took some of the lunch club food down to the church. Most of this activity was carried out in the wind and the rain.</p>
        <p>Later I completed my notes on sources of information about our life.</p>
