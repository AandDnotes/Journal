        <h1>Tuesday 12th February</h1>
        <p>After breakfast we walked down to Steyning with bags of stuff for a charity shop. Angela went on to the butchers and then to Rosemary Avenue while I stopped for a haircut.</p>
        <p>After a slightly early lunch Angela walked to St Peter's church for a meeting and I drove to Field Place for an RCEA talk on the history of the Westland Aircraft company. I also spoke to Simon Chambers (chair of the Sussex/Surrey IMechE) about collaborating on engagement with SMEs and saw Mike's prototype light tube. Simon seemed interested, but talked about Thales and Elekta, rather than small companies.</p>
