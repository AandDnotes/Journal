        <h1>Wednesday 27th February</h1>
        <p>Today was forecast to be the last of the warm, sunny days. Angela started with some housework and I forwarded a request to hold a ball-launcher event for guides/brownies. After an early lunch Angela went to table tennis.</p>
        <p>I went in the garage to fit new fibre washers to the carburetters. However, there still seems to be a slight leak. I also checked the fuel level in each carb. It may be a bit high, which would account for the rich mixture. I also spent some time trying to work out how to make a table of contents slide in and out, going under a repeating edge image, but no success.</p>
