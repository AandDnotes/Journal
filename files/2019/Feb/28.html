        <h1>Thursday 28th February</h1>
        <p>The last day of February and the weather has changed. It started grey, with a little sunshine, then rained heavily and then back to grey.</p>
        <p>We started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. He has had a 'flip-tap' fitted and his 'bag' removed, at least for some of the time.</p>
        <p>We went on to Holmebush, since Angela had a 20% off voucher for M&amp;S. The journey took a long time due to road works. Angela bought a jumper and I bought two pairs of trousers. We then did the grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch we sorted the books in one of the book cases. So now we have several cardboard boxes full of books to take to a charity shop.</p>
