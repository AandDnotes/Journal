        <h1>Monday 11th February</h1>
        <p>We started the day by driving down to the Methodist church where I left Angela to start cooking for the lunch club. Afterwards, she went on to a WI committee meeting.</p>
        <p>When I got home I showered and then went off to Victoria Grand to see Dad. I took the iPad to show him Rowan without her front teeth and a video of Moon running around the paddock. I left him as his lunch was being brought up to him, since the lift is still out of order.</p>
        <p>After my lunch I made a few phone calls about IET STEM workshops and then did more research on an html Table of Contents pop-up, finally emailing Paul for advice.</p>
        <p>Later I went to West Chiltington for the WSMGOC meeting. With the I sat with Tony, Linda and Ray (?) and together we did the 'feel what's in the bag' competition, and won a bottle of wine. So Tony will try to 'smuggle' it into the Annual Dinner so that we can all have a glass.</p>
