        <h1>Friday 1st February</h1>
        <p>The snow was not as severe here as had been forecast, although we had no plans to go far. Angela walked to Steyning, but the paths were mainly clear. And I stayed indoors. My day was roughly split between IET email and phone calls and sorting things out. I spoke with Mike Wooldridge about building some lighter version of his light tubes for the Energy Watch workshop and checked that food had been ordered for Tuesday's talk. I also had a couple of calls from Dean the structural engineer. The second was to ask for my email address, but still nothing has arrived!</p>
        <p>Angela and I both tackled items from the top cupboard in the study. She started sorting through a bag of photographs, keeping only those that were of interest. I looked at the video camera, only to find that I could remember seeing the power supply in the desk draw, but could no longer find it. I found it in a bag in the dustbin! So I charged one of the batteries and checked that the camera worked. I also looked up the Pentax 35mm camera and found that there are 50 for sale on Ebay! My other find was diaries dating back from 1972. Some are missing and they stop at 2008, but I have started going through them and noting anything of interest. I've already found a couple of car registration numbers that were missing in my car list.</p>
        <p>In between, I closed one of Angela's Virgin accounts and moved the money into another that pays higher interest.</p>
