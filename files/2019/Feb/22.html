        <h1>Friday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>It was a grey, misty start to the day. Angela walked down to the butchers and the library before we set off in the MG. She delivered some paper flowers that she had made while I put some petrol in the tank. We then drove to Billingshurt, to the Bat &amp; Ball for the WSMGOC pub run. While we were there th sun came out.</p>
        <p>It was a good meal and interesting company. As we were leaving so a hot air balloon was inflated and launched from the field adjacent to the car park. We all then went 100 yards down the road to Milestone Classics to look around their garage. Of the 15+ cars, some were sold, some for sale and some being worked on. It was a good day out.</p>
