        <h1>Wednesday 6th February</h1>
        <p>Just before lunch this morning a removal firm came to collect the piano. There were only two of them, but they had a trolley and a ramp and put the piano on its end on the trolley. It took us a while to clean up the skirting board and carpet where the piano had been.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and Bernard and Greg came here for a meeting about our proposed business event. We also discussed a 'wine and cheese' event for members. Then, after an early dinner, we went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'The Bookshop'. It was a wet, but luckily not too windy evening.</p>
