        <h1>Tuesday 19th February</h1>
        <p>As usual after a WI meeting, Angela took the bus to Storrington to pay in the resulting cash. Meanwhile I dealt with a number of IET email and emailed the speakers that I had arranged for the 2019/20 season.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to Rosemary Avenue to do some tidying in the garden. I found that I needed to prepare a certificate for tomorrow's speaker. I also created a 'map' of how to get from the Richmond Building on the Arts Building, where tomorrow's talk will now be held.</p>
