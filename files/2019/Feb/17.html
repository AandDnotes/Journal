        <h1>Sunday 17th February</h1>
        <p>A mainly sunny day, at least until mid afternoon. While Angela went to church I replaced the battery in my iPhone. It was fiddly, but worked without any problem. I then charged it to 100% and left it charging for a further two hours. now I need to let it discharge completely so as to recalibrate the battery.</p>
        <p>I then spent a little time looking in my car books and online for photos of an MG of which David Wright wants to make a model. But I didn't have much success.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went in the garden and I went in the garage. I checked the plugs and points and then started the engine. I played with the carburetters, but ended up only making them one flat leaner.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Paul, Krista and Rowan. Krista is thinking of getting a Shetland pony to keep Freda company when they find another home for Moon.</p>
