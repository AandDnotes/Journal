        <h1>Thursday 21st February</h1>
        <p>We got away fairly early this morning to go to Victoria Grand, calling into Rosemary Avenue on the way to pick bags of garden waste. We showed Dad images of houses in which he had lived. With a little prompting he remembered the names of the roads, but got the timeline a little confused.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Holmebush via the Shoreham tip to dispose of the garden waste and two bags of rags. After coffee we did the weekly groceries shop, having a late meal when we got home.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went in the garden and I removed the float chamber mounting bolt of one carburetter so as to measure the size of fibre washers needed. The top and bottom of the bolt, which allows fuel to pass from the float chamber to the main body, are different sizes, 9/16" at the bottom and 7/16" at the top. I ordered two packs of five of each size from an online supplier.</p>
        <p>In the evening I went to the IMechE ADSC committee meeting. I'd been invited to talk about possible collaboration on STEM events. I thought it was being held at Ricardo, but hound out, a little late, that it was at Bernard's house.</p>
