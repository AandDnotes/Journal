        <h1>Tuesday 26th February</h1>
        <p>We mustn't 'count our chickens', but we seem to have sold our house. In fact we had two offers today. Firstly, the Harrises, who had a seond/third viewing yesterday, upped their offer to £610K. Then the Baxters offered £605,500. Ben went back to them with news of the other offer and they were happy to match it. The Harrises are in a chain, but the Baxters aren't, so we accepted the Baxter's offer.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I drove to Horsham and parked at Greg's house. It was another fine, sunny and warm day, so we then walked into town to the Council offices to meet Sarah Bennetts from West Sussex County Council. She had come up from Chichester to see us and do some other things. We talked to her mainly about STEM activities and how the IET could work with their other initiatives. While I was out, Angela finished cutting the back grass and emptied the manger baskets.</p>
