        <h1>Tuesday 5th February</h1>
        <p>The noise reducing liquid that I bought yesterday was put to use this morning. I followed the usual procedure of tying up the ball valve, draining a few bowls out of the central heating system and pouring the liquid into the pipe from the expansion tank. Now we just need to see if the banging stops or at least reduces. Angela went to Steyning and to Rosemary Avenue, bringing back papers to sort through and some towels.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela did sorting and shredding, while I worked through more old diaries. Later I went to Crawley for the IET talk, for which I was convenor. We had 33 people in the audience and it was an interesting talk, even if it was focussed on the speaker's research.</p>
