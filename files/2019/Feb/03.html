        <h1>Sunday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>Another cold, but sunny day. Angela went to church and called into Rosemary Avenue while I did the usual updates and backups and emailed people about IET workshops. I also ordered an HDMI to VGA adapter for use at IET talks. It will be delivered tomorrow to the Amazon lockers at the Beeding service station.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela continued going through photos and I went through my old diaries for the 1980s. Later we spoke with Paul et al. They have found that Freda is in foal! She is probably due in April of May. So they will probably sell (or give away) Moon.</p>
