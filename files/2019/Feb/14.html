        <h1>Thursday 14th February</h1>
        <p>We set off earlier than usual to Victoria Grand since we were expecting a call from the St Barnabas team from midday onwards to view the Rosemary Avenue contents. So we visited Dad early and had finished our weekly groceries shop and got home by twenty to twelve. Only to find a message to say that they were on their way!</p>
        <p>The guys looked around and noted what is in each room. Someone will phone in a few days with a quote. We were home by 12:20.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela worked in the garden and I 'played' with my reminiscences web site.</p>
