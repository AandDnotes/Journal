        <h1>Friday 15th February</h1>
        <p>The end of a fine, dry week. In fact, although starting frosty, today was the sunniest day of the week, with unbroken sunshine and a light breeze. We also had scheduled a second viewing, the prospective purchaser bringing a builder to look at potential extension.</p>
        <p>So we decided (or rather I suggested) to take the MG to Nymans gardens. The viewing was at midday, so we set off at 11:30, stopped at Beeding to get some petrol, and then went on through Henfield and Cowfold to Handcross. We had lunch in the cafe and then walked through the woodland paths. We arrived home at twenty to four, after a good day out.</p>
