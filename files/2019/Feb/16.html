        <h1>Saturday 16th February</h1>
        <p>Not really a day of achievements, at least not for me. We were early enough at Beeding newsagents to get a paper. Angela then worked in the garden, cutting down the raspberry canes, in preparation, hopefully, for the next owners of the house. It was a grey day all day, so I decided not to go into the garage. I prepared for Monday's IET events meeting and did some research into my first and second schools and discovered where we lived in Edmonton in the process.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. Gene and Claudia had arrived yesterday and were playing with the children, but decided to go for a walk, even though the children didn't want to go with them.</p>
        <p>The new battery for the iPhone arrived today, so I let the old battery run down to below 25% so that I can try changing it tomorrow.</p>
