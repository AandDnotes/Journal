        <h1>Wednesday 20th February</h1>
        <p>A busy day without achieving very much. I had to answer some questions that a prospective buyer had asked Ben and we have another viewing on Saturday (as well as the one tomorrow). I also waisted time answering a request to attend this evenings IET talk, only to find that an event on a similar theme was being held at Surrey and that was the one he wanted to attend.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went out with her walking group, finishing with lunch. After lunch I finally got in the garage to search for fibre washers for the carburetter bowl. I could only find one that looked suitable, but NTG want £1.50 each (and I need four), plus £7.20 delivery! So I will need to dismantle one carburetter and measure the diameter of the bolt so that I can try to find washers elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Later was a talk at Falmer on energy storage. We had to use a different lecture theatre, but had 40 in the audience.</p>
