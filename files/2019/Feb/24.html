        <h1>Sunday 24th February</h1>
        <p>It was another sunny day with practically no wind. Although there was frost on the roofs first thing, it soon warmed up.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to church and stayed for a meeting where lunch was served. I worked on the March IET newsletter. I finally finished it after dinner and sent out test versions, but I forgot to add the links to the registration buttons.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garden and finished pruning the apple tree. Then, when Angela got home, we spoke to Rowan (or a tiger). They had been to the zoo and she had her face painted.</p>
