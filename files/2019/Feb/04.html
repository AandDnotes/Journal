        <h1>Monday 4th February</h1>
        <p>On the way home from our usual Monday morning visit to Victoria Grand we had planned to call into B&amp;Q to get some boiler de-scaler. However, we decided to call into Sainsbury's for a coffee and ended up buying a few things as well. We then bought some 'noise reducer', although the one I had intended buying (and was said to be in stock) was not on the shelf. Since the liquid is in a container with a wide top I also bought some plastic funnels to replace my old ones that are cracking.</p>
        <p>My intention had been to put the boiler de-scaler in the system this afternoon, but we had a call to say that the viewing tomorrow had been cancelled and it did not stop drizzling. So I left it until tomorrow. Some previous viewers are returning for a second look on Thursday, so it needs to be done well before then.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela did her WI accounts and I dealt with email and worked through more old diaries, extracting useful information. I also drove to the Beeding service station to collect my adapter from the Amazon locker.</p>
