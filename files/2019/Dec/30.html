        <h1>Monday 30th December</h1>
        <p>After some initial heavy mist it turned into a sunny and mild day. Like most Mondays we started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. He seemed to have forgotten about Christmas, but he did remember that he'd put his new radio in the cupboard. I set it up for him, but turning it on and off may be too confusing for him, even though I wrote the instructions on his pad. He likes to turn the radio off at the wall socket, but turning it on also requires holding down the power button for a second or two. We shall see.</p>
        <p>We then popped into Waitrose for coffee and to buy a few items. On our way back home we called into Wickes to pick up their 'appliances' brochure and then into Benchmark (which was actually closed) to get their kitchen brochure. So a lot of the afternoon was spent looking at more (similar) kitchens. However, I did add more to my chapter on family and in the evening we watched (or slept through) the Paddington 2 film. It was a case of 'spot the well known actor'.</p>
