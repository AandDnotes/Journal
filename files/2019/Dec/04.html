        <h1>Wednesday 4th December</h1>
        <p>The plumber was here at 8:30. He has connected the shower and fitted the splash-back around the room. However, the board had warped in the garage and he had to leave parts wedged. He had finished by 2:15 and is coming back on Saturday to finish off.</p>
        <p>I spent the morning dealing with IET email and then a lot of the afternoon doing the monthly accounts. There were a number of messages from Equinity. Angela went to the village to get some bread rolls, since I was a little late putting the bread on. Then, after an early lunch she went to table tennis.</p>
