        <h1>Friday 13th December</h1>
        <p>It seems that the Conservatives won a majority of 80 seats in the election yesterday! My slightly sore throat from yesterday was no better and I seem to have another cold! However, today was supposed to be about painting (in the bathroom). I started doing so while Angela went down to the High Street. Then, after lunch, we went to Wickes to get a kitchen brochure and then on to Screwfix to pick up the 'loud' doorbell that I ordered yesterday. I finished painting around the edges when we got home.</p>
