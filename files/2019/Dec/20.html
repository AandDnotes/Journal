        <h1>Friday 20th December</h1>
        <p>The day started very wet, with floods in various parts, causing chaos on road and rail transport. So it was a little later in the morning that we walked down to the High Street. I wanted some white silicone and batteries for the new doorbell and we needed meat and milk.</p>
        <p>Both prior to our walk and afterwards I put together the December newsletter. Although Julie had said she would be leaving at 4pm, she actually left at lunchtime, so someone else looked at my approval request. But they spotted an error, which I corrected later in the day.</p>
        <p>Having bought white silicone I was able to complete the work in the bathroom.</p>
