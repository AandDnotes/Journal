        <h1>Tuesday 17th December</h1>
        <p>A tiring, but enjoyable day. It started early with a drive in the rain to Brighton College. This was the venue for the Brighton heat of the FIRST Lego League. We had seven teams (two from Steyning Grammar) and a great day. Getting into the centre of Brighton and out again in the evening (still in the rain) was difficult, so I was about 15 minutes late arriving and it took 45 minutes to get home. I was home by 4:30.</p>
        <p>This morning Angela took a lot of money to Storrington to bank. Most of it was lunch club money, the rest was for the WI.</p>
