        <h1>Saturday 21st December</h1>
        <p>Another mainly rainy day. Angela went to the High Street while I did the weekly accounts and took tools and paint back into the garage. I also got the cases down from the loft and replaced the pieces of carpet up there.</p>
        <p>Chris and Alan called just after one o'clock (with Boo) for lunch, after having visited Dad at Victoria Grand. It was good to talk with them. Shortly after they left we also went to Victoria Grand. We firstly called Paul so that Dad could have a quick word and then we called Victoria. We will probably talk to them both again tomorrow.</p>
