        <h1>Tuesday 31st December</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day. Not a particularly eventful one. The morning was spent catching up with things and most of the afternoon and evening was spent doing a jigsaw puzzle (and drinking a bottle of wine). We did, however, stay up to see the fireworks from London, so it was one o'clock before we went to bed.</p>
