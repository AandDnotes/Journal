        <h1>Sunday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church as usual this morning, while I did odds and ends, including packing my case for tomorrow. We had a quick chat with Paul (Rowan would not talk) and then later with Victoria. Austin and Juniper opened their small presents from us, T-shirts that they could colour (with special pens) and later wash out. They did not seem particularly impressed. Austin had been building his Lego train set. They just had the track to assemble, but were waiting for batteries to arrive. They had ordered rechargeable batteries on-line, rather than drive to a shop. Juniper was trying to work out what to do with the pots of 'slime' that she had wanted.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela packed her case.</p>
