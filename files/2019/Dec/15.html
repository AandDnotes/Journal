        <h1>Sunday 15th December</h1>
        <p>My cold progresses and I feel quite tired, perhaps because I woke up several times during the night. I've got through a lot of tissues today. However, I managed to give the bathroom ceiling and walls a second coat of paint while Angela went to church. Again I left cleaning the brush and rollers until after lunch.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
