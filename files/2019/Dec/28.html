        <h1>Saturday 28th December</h1>
        <p>This morning was a surrogate Thursday in that we went to Sainsbury's to do some grocery shopping. Angela had been to the High Street beforehand, mainly to go to the butcher, while I showered.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was spent doing odds and ends, like putting the cases back in the loft, making a temporary fix to Angela's glasses and doing the weekly accounts. This morning I tried to remove the ceramic disk cartridge int eh cold kitchen tap, but I couldn't free it. I was afraid that I might loosen something else, so we will need to get a plumber to replace it.</p>
