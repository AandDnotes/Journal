        <h1>Sunday 29th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I spent a lot of the morning working on the airing cupboard. I wasted some time by cutting a piece of plywood too short, so used a piece of MDF that was just the right size, albeit a little thick. I also refitted some slats after cutting them to fit through the pipes.</p>
        <p>Not a lot was done during the rest of the day apart from some reading and the usual Dutch lesson. However, I did update my 'important' html documents and sent Victoria and Paul an email explaining where to find them.</p>
