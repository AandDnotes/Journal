        <h1>Monday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>The start of our Christmas break (as if we needed a break). We spent most of the day travelling to Paul's. Our journey to Gatwick took an unexpected turn. We knew that the road north of Henfield was flooded, but we did not expect the road through Ashurst to be closed, so we went on to the A24, past Horsham and around the Crawley ring road. Since we parked int eh short-term car park we were quire early, only to find that our flight was delayed by half an hour. This went up to three quarters of an hour, but we arrived at Schiphol just after three. After a quick lunch we caught the train to Rotterdam. I had a slight misadventure on the escalator going down to the platform. When trying to move over to let someone pass I tripped with the case and fell backwards. But no harm was done. Then we found that Angela had not 'tapped' her ov-chip card correctly to buy the supplement (she blamed me for rushing her), but the ticket inspector let us off. Paul collected us from Capelsebrug.</p>
        <p>After a pizza dinner we played some games before Rowan's bedtime.</p>
