        <h1>Thursday 12th December</h1>
        <p>Election day. But we didn't get around to voting until later in the day. We started by taking Angela to Worthing hospital for her appointment about her ears. I dropped her off and went on to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. They had let him sleep in and he was still in his pyjamas. Whilst there we phoned Uncle Mick and Aunt Joan.</p>
        <p>Just before eleven I went back to the hospital and tracked down Angela just as she was going in to see the consultant. He removed the wax and sent her for a pressure test. The said that the grommet had come out (and was in the wax) and the hole had healed. Following the pressure test he said that there was fluid in both ears. So he wants to fit a grommet in each ear, removing the fluid in the process. Angela should get an appointment in one to two months. The consultant gave her a nasal spray that might help in the short term.</p>
        <p>We decided to have some lunch in Sainsbury's after doing the groceries shopping. We then went on to Screwfix in Shoreham to buy a 'loud' doorbell, but they did not have one in stock. So I ordered one that should arrive tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Then, after a cup of tea, we went to the pharmacy, the Steyning Centre to vote and then Angela went to the library. It rained for much of the day, so we went to these places int he car!</p>
