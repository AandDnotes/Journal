        <h1>Monday 9th December</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning to help with the lunch club and then returned to collect her WI documents for a committee meeting at 2:30. Meanwhile I went to Victoria Grand and showed Dad photos of Austin and Juniper and after lunch started paining emulsion around the 'edges' of the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Later we went to the WSMGOC Christmas meeting. There was not enough space and the food was disappointing. However, the company was good.</p>
