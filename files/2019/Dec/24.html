        <h1>Tuesday 24th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Eve and Christmas music has been playing for most of the day. It rained heavily over night and for some time during the morning. However, we were able to take the ponies for a little walk up the garden while Krista cleaned out their stables. Meanwhile, Angela and Rowan made the gingerbread parts of a house. After lunch we let the ponies free for a while in the paddock while Krista, Paul, Rowan and Flo went to visit Krista's grandmother. Then I helped them stick the house pieces together with icing that Rowan mixed. It was quite messy, as was the result, but Rowan enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>At various times during the day we played games.</p>
