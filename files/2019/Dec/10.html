        <h1>Tuesday 10th December</h1>
        <p>Angela started the day by catching the bus to Storrington to bank her lunch club cash while I finished painting around the edges of the bathroom. I looked at turning around the top radiator brackets, but you need to pull the radiator some way off them in order to do so. They will just have to stay upside down.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to an RCEA meeting given by a member who worked at the NPL on ultra-sound measurement and calibration. I got caught in quite a lot of traffic on the way home in the dark, wind and rain.</p>
