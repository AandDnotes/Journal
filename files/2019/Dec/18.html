        <h1>Wednesday 18th December</h1>
        <p>I started the day by having a shower in the 'new' bathroom. My aim had been to finish the bathroom, but the Post Office / hardware shop did not have any white silicone. They will order it for late tomorrow. I also found that we didn't have the right batteries for the new 'loud' door bell. So I just replaced the bell push. Meanwhile, Angela went off to Sainsbury's to do a 'small' weekly shop.</p>
        <p>After lunch I read the documents for tomorrow's GOG meeting at Brighton and revised my article for Main Gear.</p>
