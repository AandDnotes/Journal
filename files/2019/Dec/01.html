        <h1>Sunday 1st December</h1>
        <p>A fine day, even if I didn't see much of it. While Angela went to church I put the first coat of primer on the bathroom ceiling and walls, although it took until one o'clock to get the first coat on. After lunch I got a second coat on the ceiling before we spoke to Paul et al and then managed to get a second coat on the walls before dinner. I had to clean the brush and rollers after dinner. So now it is almost ready for painting!</p>
        <p>Paul had all the family round, since Wednesday is Sinterklaus's birthday and the children get presents from him. Angela spent a lot of time writing letters and Christmas cards. Her deafness is pretty bad. Even if she is looking at me I need to shout.</p>
