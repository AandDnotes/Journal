        <h1>Thursday 19th December</h1>
        <p>I discovered that if I wanted my December newslatter to be approved by Julie I needed to submit it before the end of tomorrow. So I spent the evening drafting the text and working out what photos I wanted to include.</p>
        <p>I had to leave it until the evening since I was at a Gift Oversight Group meeting at Brighton during the afternoon.</p>
