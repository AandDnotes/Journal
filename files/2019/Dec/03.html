        <h1>Tuesday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>It was almost lunchtime before I managed to start painting and by the time I had to go out I had only put top-coat on the door and frame.</p>
        <p>This evening was an IET talk for which I was the convenor. Our 'last minute' speaker was very good and there were many complements from the audience. Luckily I had taken my VGA-to-thunderbolt adapter, which worked on her laptop. Unfortunately Florentine had to catch a train and so we didn't have time to have a meal, so I took her to the station and then came home to have something to eat.</p>
