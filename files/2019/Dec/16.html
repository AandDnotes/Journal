        <h1>Monday 16th December</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Monday we started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. Our plan was then to have coffee in Waitrose, but their machine was out of action. So we just bought a few things and came home.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I put the bathroom mirror back on the wall. I put Duct Tape over the 'cracked' cover on the back, since it looked as though it covered the ring of LEDs. I also 'cleaned up' things and put transparent silicone under the skirting board. Unfortunately my white silicone had gone hard, so I will need to buy some more.</p>
        <p>After dinner I read notes on the FIRST Lego League Robot Challenge, which takes place tomorrow in Brighton.</p>
