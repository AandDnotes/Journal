        <h1>Sunday 8th December</h1>
        <p>Another day of painting. At least, while Angela was at church I put a gloss coat on the bathroom woodwork. After talking with Paul et al later in the afternoon I added a second coat to the window sill. Just the ceiling and walls to do now!</p>
        <p>Between coats I also updated the Windows system on the laptop (after backing up files), which took most of the afternoon, and made another loaf.</p>
