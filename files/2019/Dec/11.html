        <h1>Wednesday 11th December</h1>
        <p>I went off fairly early to David FB's and then in his TF to the Roundabout Hotel at West Chiltington. We then did the Sussex Wanderers run to the Spur for lunch. I got home at about 3:45 and Angela got back from table tennis just after four. I was glad that I didn't take the TC, since it rained heavily at various times and part of the run was very muddy.</p>
        <p>In the evening we went to Barbara's, at number 52, to meet some of the neighbours.</p>
