        <h1>Wednesday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Day (Eerste Kerstdag). After heavy rain over night the day became dry and the sun came out just as it was setting. As expected, we started by opening presents. We spent part of the day building various marble runs, although Rowan soon started following the instructions herself and then making up her own runs.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon Greet and Wim came for dinner. We sat around the table cooking various pieces of meat on a hot plate in some small pans. It is a traditional way to cook a meal in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Angela went out with Paul and Flo for a walk after lunch.</p>
