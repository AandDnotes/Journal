        <h1>Friday 27th December</h1>
        <p>We decided to make our visit to Berkenwoude quite short, only three full days plus a part day at either end, so that on the one hand we did not outstay our welcome and on the other we did not get too tired. However, the time did go quickly and today was our journey home. We left (or rather Paul et al took us to Capelsebrug) a little before ten. We then did the usual of Metro to Rotterdam Centraal, train to Schiphol, plane to Gatwick and car home, arriving at about three, UK time. A total journey time of six hours.</p>
        <p>Everything was on time and by the time we'd had coffee at Schiphol we could check in our bags. Then by the time we'd had some lunch it was almost time for our flight. We were thirsty when we got to Gatwick, so stopped for a cup of tea before crossing to the short-stay car park and driving home.</p>
        <p>Our plan was to walk down to the High Street to buy a fish and chip supper. In fact we did walk down, but the shop was closed (until January 3rd)! So we bought some frozen fish and chips in the Coop, walked home and cooked them. Not quite the same, but it did the job, albeit a little later than planned.</p>
