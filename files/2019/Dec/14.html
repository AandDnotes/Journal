        <h1>Saturday 14th December</h1>
        <p>It would be more satisfying to have a journal where you simply turned to a page and typed your entry. However, to keep the text accessible and secure I will have to make do with writing basic html, saving it on GitHub and then using a viewer to read it (occasionally), even if I need to perform a search on the GitHub site.</p>
        <p>Today I did get some white emulsion on the ceiling and walls of the bathroom, even if I didn't start until eleven. However, I did finish in time for a late lunch, although I had to clean the brush and rollers afterwards. Angela went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then did some housework.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Austin and Brandon and then Victoria, with just a "good morning" from Juniper. Austin (although really Brandon) had a 'Turing Tumble' marble logic kit. It looks good, but they were stuck on one of the puzzles. Then I did the weekly accounts, including a statement reconciliation while Angela cooked dinner. Then I completed my plan of the kitchen, with no content, but including dimensions.</p>
