        <h1>Thursday 5th December</h1>
        <p>A pretty typical Thursday. We went to Victoria Grand, went into Barclays in Worthing to try to get Angela's correspondence address changed. We also bought some wax coated cheese to take to Paul's at Christmas. We then went on to Lyons Farm for the weekly groceries shop and called into the Wren kitchen showroom to pick up a brochure.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I started reading the FLL documents.</p>
