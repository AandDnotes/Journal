        <h1>Monday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>It was frosty, but a clear, blue sky for much of the day. The plumber was supposed to come today, but he phoned to say that the parts had been put on a delivery van and he didn't know when they would arrive. So he will come on Wednesday! I phoned the manager at UK Power Networks and he assured me that Florentine would be coming to give the talk. He said that she had not done this type of thing before.</p>
        <p>Angela stayed at home to wait for the delivery, which came at about 11:30. I went to Victoria Grand and got Dad to finish writing his Christmas cards. That took most of the morning and with various other things it was not until 4:30 that I started thinking about painting. One of the other things was an email from Florentine with her details and then a short call from her. In the end all I did was put some metal primer on the copper pipes to the radiator.</p>
