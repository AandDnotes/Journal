        <h1>Saturday 7th December</h1>
        <p>The plumber has finished the bathroom! Now I just need to complete it's paining. He arrived at 8:30 and left a little before twelve. Someone should call on Monday to pick up the rubbish.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went to the church to cook the turkey rolls for Monday's lunch club. I did the weekly accounts. After lunch we went down again to carve the turkey, which only took an hour. When we got home we spoke with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Once again this is just a note of the events of the day, rather than my thoughts and commentary on the world around me.</p>
