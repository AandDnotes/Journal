        <h1>Monday 28th January</h1>
        <p>We spent most of the day out. Angela walked to Steyning while I finished and submitted February's IET newsletter. We then went to Victoria Grand, a little later than usual. So we only had half an hour with Dad before he went down for lunch.</p>
        <p>We had to park in Grand Avenue since the Victoria Grand driveway was full. So when we left Dad we walked to a bus stop and caught the 700 into Worthing to have lunch and then to go to the cinema. We saw 'Stan and Laurel'. It was a good film.</p>
        <p>We then went for a cup of tea and Angela bought a pair of wellington boots before we caught the bus back to Grand Avenue and drove home. Later, in the early evening, someone called to look at the piano. It was the person who had said he had a child car seat, but then couldn't find it! He brought a piano teacher with him and they both liked the piano. He now needs to work out how he will move it.</p>
