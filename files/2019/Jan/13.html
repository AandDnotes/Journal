        <h1>Sunday 13th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the usual updates and backups, although I also did an adjustment to the 'investment' spreadsheet. Updates to the Windows system took most of the morning. While that was happening I sorted through the documents in the filing cabinet, throwing out most of them, either for recycling or shredding. Two files that I did not throw out were the two undergraduate projects that I did at Lancaster.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried starting the TC, but although the battery turned the engine quite fast it did not fire. And soon the battery would not turn the engine. So I put it back on charge and checked/cleaned the plugs. They did not seem particularly dirty.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Paul, and briefly with Rowan. I also added a little to my article on the steering box.</p>
