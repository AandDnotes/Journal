        <h1>Monday 14th January</h1>
        <p>The morning was really spent going to Victoria Grand. We had to park around the corner and they had all the internal doors closed, since the fire alarm system (that holds the doors open) had been flooded by a water leak.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon Angela went to a WI committee meeting and I tried starting the TC after checking that the carburetter needles were not stuck. The battery, which I had charged over night, would hardly turn the engine. So I went to Halfords in Shoreham and bought a new battery. It turned the engine easily, but the engine did not fire. I checked that the plugs are sparking.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting, where someone talked about his life involving classic cars and racing.</p>
