        <h1>Sunday 6th January</h1>
        <p>Another rainy day, in fact a very rainy day with quite a strong wind. So we whiled away the morning, had an early lunch and then Victoria took the children and us to Sacramento to a model railway exhibition. The mother of Juniper's friend Lena had called and asked if we would like to join them there. The rain was very unpleasant, both driving there and walking from the car park. But it was a good exhibition, with about a dozen train layouts and lots of trader stalls. We arrived just before one thirty and were home just after four o'clock. Then we had a good steak dinner that Brandon had cooked.</p>
