        <h1>Monday 21st January</h1>
        <p>We had three viewings this morning. So we extended our visit to Victoria Grand by calling into Sainsbury's to get what was already on the shopping list. I also walked down to Argos to buy a trickle charger for the TC's battery.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I went into the garage. I firstly removed the carburetter pistons and cleaned the top of the jets with a tee-pee brush. However, it made no difference. The engine would only continue to run with the choke out and the revs high.</p>
        <p>On the basis that, if I still have about 10% diesel in the mix of petrol and diesel and, if some of the diesel is not burning, then the mixture going into the cylinders is weaker than it needs to be. Pulling the choke out makes the mixture richer. So I lowered the jets by five flats and the engine kept running. In fact, I took the car for my usual test run. It seemed to run well!</p>
        <p>After putting the TC back in the garage I connected the new trickle charger to the battery.</p>
