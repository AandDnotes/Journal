        <h1>Monday 7th January</h1>
        <p>We stayed safely in bed while Brandon went off to work and Victoria got the children ready for school and they all left. A little while after Victoria returned we walked to downtown Davis to have coffee, buy some bread and get some cash. We chose to go into the bank rather than use the ATM, which was a mistake. It took over ten minutes just to get cash and required presenting a passport and filling in a form. We walked home via some quieter back streets. By this time a grey day had become much warmer with some sunshine.</p>
        <p>Later, Victoria went off to collect Austin from school and then went to the supermarket and on to collect Juniper. We all played one game, but then Austin only wanted to play video games. Austin eat a little dinner, but Juniper had already eaten fruit snacks and didn't eat much dinner at all. She then eat more jelly and more fruit. Again they were late for bed.</p>
