        <h1>Tuesday 15th January</h1>
        <p>We had a relatively early start to Littlehampton, by bus. We left home at about 9:30 and where in a coffee shop by eleven. We spent some time in the Kent Reliance office sorting out savings accounts before we went to 'the Fish Factory' for lunch. Since the weather was pretty gloomy it was then a case of catching the bas back to Shoreham. We were home by about 3:30.</p>
        <p>Later I went to Bernard's house for a meeting of the IET events sub-committee. There was a lot of straying off topic, but we made good progress.</p>
        <p>In the mean time the Brexit withdrawal bill was rejected by Parliament by two thirds to one third!</p>
