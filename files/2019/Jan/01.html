        <h1>Tuesday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day. 2019 already! A relatively late rise for everyone and a nice sweet bread for breakfast (even though Victoria had baked it with the cling film still on the top). Part of the morning was spent making butternut squash soup for lunch, which was then a little late. I completed my January newsletter and submitted it for approval. I also asked Sathish to invite Ludivine Bell to our next committee meeting. A&amp;J didn't get dressed until the afternoon, after V&amp;B had gone out to the cinema. They saw Spiderman!</p>
        <p>After we had played some games we got them washed and dressed and took them to the 'Rainbow City' park. As usual, Juniper did not want to leave. In the process of getting her away from the park I pulled a muscle in my left leg as I pushed her in the buggy up a slope. So it took us a while to get back, arriving just after V&amp;B had returned. We then spent a while making chicken curry from Friday's left over chicken and a variety of vegetables. Victoria make naan bread dough and Brandon cooked them in the pizza oven (outside). It was all quite good, but, as usual, neither A or J eat much, then wanting lots of bedtime snacks (which they got).</p>
