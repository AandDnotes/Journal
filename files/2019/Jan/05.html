        <h1>Saturday 5th January</h1>
        <p>Today was overcast and raining for most of the day. However, we made a relatively early start by taking Austin and Juniper to Home Depot for their monthly kid's building activity. They built and painted a mini white board on an easel. Otherwise we played a game or two, started building a marble run and generally sat around.</p>
