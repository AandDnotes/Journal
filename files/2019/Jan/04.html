        <h1>Friday 4th January</h1>
        <p>After our tiring day yesterday we were all quite late up and then spent the morning playing with the children. Austin and I finished his cardboard robot controller pack and he started using it to control a 'destroyer' robot. It is very good technology, even if it is all about destruction. Brandon started another batch of beer, his friend Ed coming round for a short while.</p>
        <p>Following lunch Victoria went off to the supermarket and the rest of us went to the Rainbow City park; Austin and Juniper on their bikes and the rest of us on foot. We arrived home just after Victoria returned. Austin was telling us about his favourite 'Paw Patrol' cartoons, so I showed him some video of 'Thunderbirds are Go' craft taking off and landing. I don't think he was that impressed. A little later Brandon went out to meet up for dinner with his friend Dan.</p>
