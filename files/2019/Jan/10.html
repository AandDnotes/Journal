        <h1>Thursday 10th January</h1>
        <p>We were tired when we went to bed last night, but, in spite of waking up a couple of times during the night, I didn't expect to sleep until 9:15. So we skipped showering and were still late going to Victoria Grand. We showed Dad some photos that we had taken in California and left as he was going down to lunch. We went on to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. So it was about 1:30 before we got home.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to my 3 o'clock appointment at the hygienist, with what was left of the afternoon spent going through emails and sorting out a new energy tariff. We decided to switch from First Utility to Octopus! That means our bill will only go up by about £150 next year, rather than £300, although Octopus will not be able to use our smart meters for readings.</p>
        <p>When we were at Lyons Farm I got two copies of Austin's school photo and bought a picture frame for Dad. So I put A&amp;J's photos in our frame and in the new one.</p>
