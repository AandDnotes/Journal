        <h1>Wednesday 9th January</h1>
        <p>Our second short day. Although we left Oakland 45 minutes late, we arrived at Gatwick only 20 minutes late (at 12:20), after a short night. Russell was there to meet us and we were home before two.</p>
        <p>We dumped our bags and then walked to Rosemary avenue to check it and then into Steyning to get some milk. We then unpacked and prepared for an early night.</p>
