        <h1>Tuesday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela took her WI cash to the bank in Storrington and I mailed some prospective speakers for the next season of IET talks. Then, before Angela got home, I went to Halfords in Shoreham to get some thread lock. I actually bought some stud lock, which is supposed to fill half millimeter gaps. I also tried the 'sat nav' with Apple Maps. It is fine, but the volume was a bit low.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage, checked that there was oil in the steering box, tied up cables under the dash and refitted the steering wheel with some stud lock on the splines. I will need to see how it feels on the next run.</p>
        <p>After dinner we discovered that the printer would not work. This was because I had turned off the TakTalk router wi-fi. I changed the devices to AirPort, but forgot about the printer. It took some time to install software and make the changes.</p>
