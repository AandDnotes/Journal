        <h1>Friday 25th January</h1>
        <p>Angela helped at another funeral today. She went off just before 10:30 and got home after 3:30. So not quite as arduous as last Wednesday. Apart from uploading my web pages on our last trip to Paul's I spent most of the morning either replying to IET emails or preparing images for the February newsletter.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage to check the TC. The oil level was at the full mark and the plugs were in better shape than I had expected. Dipping the tank showed that there is three gallons (or 13.6 litres) of fuel. My estimate is that, following various additions and syphoning, there was about 29 litres of petrol/diesel mixture in the tank. Following my running of the engine in the garage and my 52 mile run on Wednesday I have used about 15.4 litres, or 3.4 gallons. Therefore my pub run probably only achieved 17 mpg!</p>
