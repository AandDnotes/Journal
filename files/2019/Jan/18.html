        <h1>Friday 18th January</h1>
        <p>Today was generally bright, but cold. Angela went out this morning, to Rosemary Avenue and to Steyning High Street, but I only poked my nose out of the door. I didn't even go into the garage!</p>
        <p>So I was very busy doing seemingly not a lot. In fact it was a lot of small things, mainly seated in the study. I renewed my membership of the BMFA and then of the SRFC, paying both sets of fees online. The structural engineer hadn't phoned, so I called them and this time he did call back. He is coming on Wednesday, but I had to pay up front. We also had a call from the estate agent to arrange a viewing for Monday morning. Otherwise I replied to IET STEM emails, updated the accounts and arranged for a maturing bond (one of Angela's) to be transferred into an easy access account.</p>
        <p>Today was also an opportunity to tell my sorry tale of diesel and the TC to the mg-tabc group so as to solicit advice. I had three replies, but none helped, only commiserated.</p>
