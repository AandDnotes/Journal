        <h1>Tuesday 8th January</h1>
        <p>A slightly shorter day than usual. Victoria took us to the train station where we caught the 12:25 Capital Corridor train to Oakland Coliseum. From there we took the BART extension to the airport (having failed again to top up our BART cards). We had a late lunch and then boarded our 'six o'clock' flight. Boarding started 45 minutes late because the plane, due to customs restrictions, has to unload at one gate and then be moved to another gate for boarding. We eventually took off just before seven. So night came early, after a meal and watching a film.</p>
