        <h1>Saturday 26th January</h1>
        <p>After walking to Beeding to buy a newspaper we only had a little while to read some of it before we had to go to Rosemary Avenue. We had a viewing of our house at one o'clock, so we made some lunch and a flask of coffee and took it to Rosemary avenue to eat. We had decided to bring the TV back here, since there is no longer a licence. I had expected to find the TV box in the loft, but there is nothing up there. While un-connecting the TV Angela vacuumed the hall and dining room. We also brought back the DVD player.</p>
        <p>Before leaving Rosemary Avenue we called on Sandy and John to see their new extension. John demonstrated his new 'in wall' speakers and I helped him move a heavy cupboard.</p>
