        <h1>Wednesday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>A tiring but good day. We started early, with Brandon taking us at eight o'clock to the station. Everyone else was up and had eaten breakfast when we left, so Brandon returned home for the others while we bought the train tickets and we all caught the nine o'clock train to Oakland. There was a short hold-up, so we were late arriving. however, we found the ferry terminal and just caught the 11 o'clock ferry to San Fransisco. The first port of call was the Ferry Building, but we stayed on the ferry to Pier 41.</p>
        <p>It was lunch time by now (they eat early and the children had both eaten most of the snacks that Victoria had packed) so Brandon found online a jacket potato 'place' just off the main coast road. It didn't look particularly clean, but the potatoes were good. We then walked back to Pier 39 to look at the sea lions basking on the pontoons. They were very smelly.</p>
        <p>Then it was back past where we had eaten to the end of the cable car line. Brandon had bought us all day passes so we went to the other end of the Powell-Mason line and walked back up Powell to Union Square. There we saw the Christmas decorations and the ice skating rink. We had a good view of the whole square from the seventh floor of Macy's, where we had popped in for a drink. It had been sunny all day and it was really quite warm in San Fransisco. We had to take off a layer.</p>
        <p>Originally we had thought of having dinner in San Fransisco and then getting the BART to Richmond, but we decided to walk up to California street and catch a tram back to the Ferry Building. We then just caught the ferry back to Oakland where we called into an Italian restaurant for a light meal and again just caught the 6:10 train to Davis. We waited at the station for Them to collect the car and take the children home. Then Brandon came to collect us. We were back by about eight o'clock.</p>
