        <h1>Saturday 12th January</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier this morning. So I took the jerry-can, in the Panda, to Beeding service station to get 15 litres of 'Supreme' unleaded petrol. Meanwhile, Angela decided to walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper. The rest of the morning was spent reading the paper and updating the accounts, while Angela cut up the cooked oranges.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried to syphon some more petrol/diesel from the TC, but found that I could not get low enough. So I simply added the 15 litres to the tank, along with some additive. However, the battery would not turn over the engine, so I connected the charger.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Victoria for a relatively short time; they were about to go to the supermarket so as to be back in time for Brandon to watch the football. After that I checked the bank statement against my spreadsheet and Angela made marmalade, nine pounds of it.</p>
