        <h1>Wednesday 16th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I paid Dad's paper bill and set up standing orders for our new regular savings accounts. The latter was difficult because the Santander online system send text messages with a one-time code. This is fine if you have a signal!</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela, as usual on a Wednesday, went to table tennis. I went into the garage and removed and cleaned the float chambers on the TC. The car then started, but would only continue to run with a lot of choke and high revs. Also, it was running very roughly. So I suspect that it is only running on two cylinders. This implies that one carburetter is not passing fuel.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed the speaker for the IET talk on robot-human interaction.</p>
