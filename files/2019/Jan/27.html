        <h1>Sunday 27th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church this morning I spent most of the time preparing my February newsletter. One talk in February doesn't seem to be in the IET events calendar, so I couldn't include a link for registration. I've emailed Julie Hudson to find out why. However, I generated a test email and Bernard has checked it.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Rowan, Paul and Krista. They had been out for lunch for Krista's grandmother's 90th birthday. I then went into the garage to check the TC's windscreen chip repair (still looks worse than before I tried to repair it) and cover up the car. I couldn't find a way of keeping the bonnet open without laying it back on itself so as to connect the trickle charger. Since it needs to be well ventilated I left it unconnected. Then I replaced our 26" TV and our old DVD player with the 32" TV and DVD player from Rosemary Avenue. It looks quite big.</p>
