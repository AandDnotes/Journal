        <h1>Thursday 31st January</h1>
        <p>Thursday again! However, rather than head straight for Victoria Grand and then on to Sainsbury's, we firstly went to the health centre so that Angela could get more batteries for her hearing aids. Luckily this did not take long. We needed to be out by ten o'clock since there was another viewing of the house at that time.</p>
        <p>After lunch we saw Nick Quincey arrive at the 'wood', so I went out to have a word with him about moving his equipment so as to not put off potential buyers. He wasn't very sympathetic and he put the digger back where it had been.</p>
        <p>The forecast snow arrived by about nine in the evening.</p>
