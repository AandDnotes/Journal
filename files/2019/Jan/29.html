        <h1>Tuesday 29th January</h1>
        <p>Angela did her usual walk to Steyning, mainly to go to the butchers, while I spent most of the morning on IET issues, including how to get the Brighton student access to our blog. After lunch we both sorted out more things, mainly cupboards and draws in the study.</p>
        <p>The weather forecast was for snow and ice as the evening progressed, so we tried to finish the IET committee meeting a little earlier than usual. We had one new member attending, which was good. It was snowing (and settling) when we left at nine o'clock, but was not settling when I got home.</p>
