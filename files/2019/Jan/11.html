        <h1>Friday 11th January</h1>
        <p>Another late morning. By the time that we had eaten breakfast and showered it was almost 10:30. Angela walked to Steyning while I read the surveyor's report and caught up with email. In between I repacked the stop tap, which was leaking badly, syphoned off more fuel from the TC and took it to Simms, who poured it into a drum. Meanwhile Angela went to the veg shop to get some Seville oranges. On our way home we called in at Rosemary Avenue to read the gas and electricity meters.</p>
        <p>Angela cooked the oranges while I did the weekly accounts, monthly accounts and shares update.</p>
