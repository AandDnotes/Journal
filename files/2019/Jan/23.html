        <h1>Wednesday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>A cold, but good day, at least for me. The structural engineer arrived at ten o'clock and spent an hour looking at the extension, before saying that everything is well. He will send an email report first because his boss is away for two weeks and he will need to approve it.</p>
        <p>Angela left the house at eleven to help with Phil Clarke's funeral. She took two cakes with her. She didn't get home until about 7:30, by which time I had cooked dinner and put it on hold.</p>
        <p>Also at eleven I took the TC on the WSMGOC pub run to Charlton, near Singleton. There and back was a total of 52 miles. There were 19 people at the pub. The weather was cold and grey when I left. It stayed cold, but the sun came out en route. However, I left the hood up and was home about 3:30.</p>
