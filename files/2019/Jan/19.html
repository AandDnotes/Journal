        <h1>Saturday 19th January</h1>
        <p>I did go out today, in the rain. We walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper and I spent most of the rest of the morning reading it. However, when we got home from Beeding Angela realised that she had not posted a letter, so before taking off her coat she walked to Steyning and back. Then she cooked her second batch of oranges.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela I filled cracks in the hall walls and around the front sitting room window while Angela cut up the oranges before we spoke to Victoria. Then I did a small update to one of our web pages while Angela cooked the marmalade. The responses to my post about diesel in the TC are still only 'I did that too', rather than practical advice.</p>
