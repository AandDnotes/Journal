        <h1>Thursday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Since Angela had a meeting after lunch we set off a little earlier than usual to Victoria Grand. We didn't stay very long before going off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. So we were home by 11:40.</p>
        <p>When we got home we discovered that our buyers had pulled out! They could not get a mortgage, they said because of the history of the house. We decided to get a structural engineer's report on the extension so as to avoid this in the future. Ben will advertise the house at 'offers in excess of Â£600K.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I told the solicitor. Then I examined the spark plugs, but could not see any difference between the cylinders. So I checked that the carburetter needles were both free. However, the engine would still only run at high revs with the choke well out.</p>
