        <h1>Sunday 20th January</h1>
        <p>Another cold day, but one that was sunny for most of the time. Angela went to church a little earlier than usual (she was making coffee) and got back later and then went to an inter-denomination service in the evening. So we had our main meal at lunchtime, but I had to cook it! I even cooked a sultana sponge for my pudding.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I did the weekly accounts, having forgotten to do them yesterday, and finished off my article on steering boxes, which I sent to Roger. After a late lunch we spoke with Paul et al and read the paper. Although I did press two jumpers that had been washed.</p>
