        <h1>Thursday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>Today was supposed to be a day for recovering from yesterday's exertions. We were all up quite late and we and Austin didn't go outside all day. V&amp;B went to the supermarket and later Brandon walked Juniper to the DIY store. He went later still to the brewing store so that he could start a brew tomorrow.</p>
        <p>So we spent most of the day playing with the children. Austin and I built the 'backpack' for his Nintendo 'robot' game. It took a long time and was quite complicated.It was quite tiring, so we both ended up ready for an early night. Unfortunately the children were not. Juniper must have eaten half a dozen satsumas during the day as snacks! So didn't each much of her lunch and dinner.</p>
