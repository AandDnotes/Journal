        <h1>Tuesday 18th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Storrington on the bus to pay in her WI cash, John cam around with his sack trolley to collect the freezer. I helped him take it around to their bungalow. Since it was raining they invited me in for coffee. So I didn't get much done this morning, but removing the freezer from the garage was a good step forward.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela was out again while I started doing more address changes. When Angela got back we went to Rosemary Avenue to vacuum around and bring back the liquids that I had stored in the shed when we moved house. We also read the meters and told the suppliers that Friday was the final day. It was then back to changing addresses.</p>
