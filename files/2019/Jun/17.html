        <h1>Monday 17th June</h1>
        <p>A bright, reasonably warm day. As usual on Mondays we started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad, although we called via the charity warehouse on the way, dropping off the box of light fittings. As it happened, Alan and Chris arrived at Victoria Grand shortly after we left.</p>
        <p>When we got home Angela cut the back two lawns while I caught up with some email. After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I removed weeds from the front lawn and cut it. Then I scraped out the joints between the blocks at the top of the drive in front of the garage. I then eased the blocks back up the slope and filled the joints with sand. We will need to see if it gets washed out by rain.</p>
        <p>After dinner I looked at travel insurance. Saga wanted £600, but I chose a £200 policy via Just Travel, the broker we had used before. Meanwhile, Angela finished the spare room curtains.</p>
