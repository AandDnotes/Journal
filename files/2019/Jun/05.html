        <h1>Wednesday 5th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking this morning with her WI friends. I mailed Jeremy Watson, Simon Chandler and Peter Fussey about the Summer Social and then continued fitting shelves in the study.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I helped by pruning the bay tree in the front. I also finished fitting the shelves and also fitted a power extension to the wall above the desk. Next I need to look at the desk, which seems to be coming apart at the back.</p>
