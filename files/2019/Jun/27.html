        <h1>Thursday 27th June</h1>
        <p>Our usual Thursday schedule was changed around a bit today. We started by going into Worthing, parking near the station and going to Nat West to pay the Rosemary Avenue cheque into the RBS account. We then bought some of Dad's favourite sweets in Waitrose before visiting Victoria Grand. Then it was the usual grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>After lunch Bill's friend called for the cardboard boxes and then Bernard called for a piece of copper tube. At the time I was dismantling the door bell push to clean it, since it did not always work, and Angela was cutting the front grass.</p>
        <p>While I went to the dentist to have a filling, Angela cut the other pieces of grass. Afterwards I started looking at the posters, etc. that I want to to 'pin up' at the Sussex Summer Social.</p>
