        <h1>Friday 28th June</h1>
        <p>It was probably the warmest day of the year so far, although it was still quite breezy. After the window cleaners had called and we had organised a direct debit for our water account, we set off in the TC to Denman's Garden. We got home just before one.</p>
        <p>After lunch I eventually fixed the bike brackets to the garage wall and then some nails on which to hang the petrol strimmer. Also, someone called to take the bike racks. We were expecting someone to collect the other tree lopper, but they didn't come. While I was working in the garage, Angela washed the Panda.</p>
