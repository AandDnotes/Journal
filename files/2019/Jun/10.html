        <h1>Monday 10th June</h1>
        <p>A typical Monday morning, starting with a visit to Victoria Grand (in the rain). However, since it was a holiday in the Netherlands we had a short Facetime call with Paul and Rowan while we were there.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting while I started replacing the wall lights in the sitting room. The first light (the one that we had opened) had no fittings or instructions, but the wall plugs in the second light would not hold the screws straight. Also, the electrical connector will only take one wire, whereas one of the wall lights has two wires. So I'll need to embed another connector in the wall.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting in West Chiltington and won a raffle prize (sweets). The rain was easing as I arrived home, having been raining heavily all day.</p>
