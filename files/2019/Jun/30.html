        <h1>Sunday 30th June</h1>
        <p>A glorious summer's day. Not as hot as yesterday, or as humid, and a refreshing breeze. After lunch someone called to collect the electric lawn rake and a little later we spoke with Paul and Rowan. Angela went to church as usual, but I spent most of my day in the garage.</p>
        <p>I finished dismantling the old kitchen cupboards, including cutting the work top in half (so as to get it in the car) and put my bench in place. I also took the other kitchen cupboard off the wall and assembled my modelling bench along the back wall. I'll not throw away the old cupboard (yet) since it is in quite good condition.</p>
