        <h1>Saturday 15th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went for a newspaper and then came on to Rosemary Avenue where I had taken the electric mower. We really only tidied up the garden and still need to empty the shed and vacuum around. So Angela then did some shredding when we got home, while I fitted the final ceiling light in the sitting room.</p>
        <p>We spent quite a time talking with Victoria et al. I then packed up the old lights, ready to take to GuildCare Greenhouse, and started sorting out the paintings that are not yet on the walls.</p>
