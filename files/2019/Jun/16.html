        <h1>Sunday 16th June</h1>
        <p>The day was wet on and off and became windy during the day. However, the evening turned calm, brighter and reasonably warm. While Angela went to church I did the weekly accounts and backed up the file. Then I sent several email relating to the IET social and did a couple of minor jobs.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I hung pictures around the house. When we moved in we just hung pictures on existing hooks, with little regard for what we were putting where. Some stayed where they were, but most were moved or removed from the box. we also spoke with Paul et al. They have named the foal Archie! It seems that they are born grey, but will turn black as the coat grows.</p>
        <p>Just before we sat down to dinner a couple arrived to collect the pew. They had a convertible Golf and so put the hood down and stood the pew upright on the back seat. They were a couple of hours later than they had said.</p>
