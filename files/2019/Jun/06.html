        <h1>Thursday 6th June</h1>
        <p>This morning was a typical Thursday morning. Admittedly Angela did start by taking some bay tree trimmings down to the church, but we then set off to Victoria Grand. Dad's haircut looked good. We then went into Worthing, since Angela wanted to get some net curtain to replace that in the front bedroom. Then, while Angela started the grocery shopping in Sainsbury's, I took the car over to B&Q to get some ready-mixed mortar. I had to buy a 25 Kg bag of the stuff. It was very dusty and certainly needed a small trolley (plastic basket on wheels) to get it around the shop and to the car.</p>
        <p>We were not home until about 1:30, so had lunch and did a quick Dutch lesson before setting off to the bath shop in Lancing. We were there at three, as arranged and did not leave until 4:15. We looked at the revised design, chose colours/textures for the doors, carcasses, worktops and wall boards, looked at the sanitary ware, tap and shower and mirrors. We need to decide if we want an optional non-slip surface on the shower tray and what type of mirror we want. Paul gave us a list of fitters so that we can get a quote for the installation.</p>
        <p>Before we went out this morning I set up the stereo system in the study, so when we got home I started sorting out some of the contents.</p>
