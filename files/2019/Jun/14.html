        <h1>Friday 14th June</h1>
        <p>We spent most of the day out shopping. This morning we went in search of ceiling lights for the sitting room. We started at Next (where Angela bought a sun hat), went on to Dunelm and then went to Range. Then we went back to Dunelm to buy three shades (plus one for the study), along with three ceiling roses, cables and lamp holders and three dimmable LED bulbs. On our first visit we bought a fitted valance for the spare bed.</p>
        <p>Angela is looking for a particular variety of honeysuckle (a scented one), so after lunch we went to Rogers Farm garden centre. However, all she bought was two packs of seeds.</p>
        <p>When we got home I fitted two of the three new ceiling roses and shades. The two fittings in the main part of the room are clearly newer than the one around the corner.</p>
        <p>Earlier I had messaged the person who wanted the pew to say that if I didn't hear from her by lunchtime I would offer it to the next person on the list. So I did. Then later she replied! But the next person still has not!</p>
