        <h1>Monday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. While we were there a young lady arrived to see if Dad wanted his hair cut. So we left him about to be trimmed.</p>
        <p>Angela had decided that her trousers were getting too large around the waist. So we went into Worthing so that she could she could buy some new (smaller) trousers. She also looked for a sun hat, but with no success. We had to get back in time for the delivery of our new laundry basket. We had been given a one-hour slot around lunchtime. It arrived early in the slot and is very good.</p>
        <p>After lunch I modified my newsletter, following Julie's notes, and then we took the electric mower round to Rosemary Avenue to cut the grass. When we got back Angela cut our grass and shredded most of the trimmings that she had brought back.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile I spent a long time on the phone trying to get an incompetent TalkTalk support man to understand the problem we are having. He kept putting me on hold, I guess while he asked someone what to do/say. He said that they would modify some configuration settings in the router, but could not tell me which. He will call back between 8 and 9 tomorrow. For what I don't know!</p>
        <p>After that I fitted the second shelf in the study, above the computer trolley.</p>
