        <h1>Wednesday 12th June</h1>
        <p>Today was the June Sussex Wanderers meet. So I headed for East Sussex, to the Bolney Stage. It was overcast and splitting with rain when I got there. I followed the usual couple, in their Lotus Elise this time and it started raining shortly after we started. About half way my windscreen wipers stopped working. The nut holding the wiper to the motor spindle had come loose.</p>
        <p>This happened just as the rain became torrential! So I had to complete the rest of the run peering through a rainy windscreen. However, lunch at the Laughing Fish at Isfield was good. After lunch it was still raining. I was able to fix the wipers and needed them on the way home, since it was pouring most of the way. However, I was home just after three o'clock having done a total of 69 miles.</p>
        <p>I spent some time 'drying off' the car and later replied to one of the five people who want the small pew.</p>
