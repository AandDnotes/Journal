        <h1>Thursday 13th June</h1>
        <p>Basically a standard Thursday, but with a few tweaks. We started by taking two mirrors to the charity warehouse and buying a bag of block paving sand from Wickes, before going to Victoria Grand. From there I picked up a free bottle of wine from Majestic (courtesy of Barclays) and then we had coffee in Morrisons before going on to Lyons Farm. I popped into Boots to speak to the pharmacist about my itchy foot. She thought it was fungal and so suggested a course of hydrocortisone, followed, if necessary, by Lamisil.</p>
        <p>We were home in reasonable time, but there was no reply from the person who said they wanted the pew. So I spent most of the afternoon sending email and sorting out things for the IET social.</p>
        <p>The big news of the day was that contracts have finally been exchanged on Rosemary Avenue, with completion in a weeks time.</p>
