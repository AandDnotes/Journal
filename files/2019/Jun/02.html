        <h1>Sunday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>It was a warm and fairly sunny day until the evening, when it rained. While Angela was at church I generated the June IET newsletter did the monthly accounts, for two months, since I'd missed doing them when we moved. I took the opportunity to change the address when I had to log into an account. The Adestra tool had a new editor, which was too restrictive in what it would let you generate and produced some errors in the test email. Bernard has checked it, but I have emailed Julie about the problems using the editor. All that, together with retrieving notices on share dividends, took all morning and part of the afternoon.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the arrival of our new spare bed on Tuesday we put some bedding into the 'vacuum bags' we had bought. They were not that easy to use and didn't really seem to gain you much space.</p>
        <p>It seems that it was very hot in Berkenwoude. We had a fairly short chat with Rowan and Paul before starting to look at fares to California. Returning a week into September saves us Â£200, so it looks as though I might need to miss this year's South Downs Run. However, I did enquire about joining this month's Sussex Wanderers.</p>
