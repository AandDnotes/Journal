        <h1>Wednesday 19th June</h1>
        <p>Angela was out for most of the day. In the morning she went walking with her WI friends and then in the afternoon she went to a garden centre for a cream tea with her table tennis group. Meanwhile I cleaned out the area under the freezer, removing as much dust as I could reach, since it had leaked water again. I then did more address changes (including finding a couple that I'd missed off the list) and emailed the plumber, asking him to do the work.</p>
        <p>At midday I joined an IET webinar on how to best use social media. These people seem to live in a different world! I also took photos of the petrol mower, the bike racks and the two long loppers and advertised them all on freegle. I also cut up the canes so that we can get them in the car to get them to the tip.</p>
