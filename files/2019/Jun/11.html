        <h1>Tuesday 11th June</h1>
        <p>The only thing we had planned for today was a visit from a plumber (off Leaney's list) later in the day to provide us with a quote for refitting the bathroom. He came when he said he would and will send us a quote at the end of the week.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street I finished fitting the second wall light in the siting room. I then finished filling the cracks in the study and in our bedroom.</p>
        <p>After lunch I uncovered the TC and checked it over in preparation for tomorrow's run while Angela worked in the garden. I sprayed the top part of the drive with weed killer and also 'wiped over' the little pew, took its photo and offered it on Freecycle.</p>
