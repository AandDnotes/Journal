        <h1>Tuesday 4th June</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Before nine o'clock I had a call from TalkTalk. They have decided that our router is too old and so will send us a new one. The fact that we didn't have the problem of the line dropping before we moved didn't seem to come into their thoughts.</p>
        <p>Angela waited in for the new bed (for the spare room), which was due to be delivered between eight and one. Meanwhile I went to the Coastal West Sussex meeting at Worthing College. They had put a slot for me on the agenda to tell the others what the Sussex Network do in the way of STEM and skills events. It was interesting and my help us with both schools and business contacts. I was home at about 12:30 to find that the bed had been delivered (and the old one removed) just after ten.</p>
        <p>After lunch I emailed the committee about the Three Bridges Forum and today's meeting while Angela filled the base of the new bed before going down to the High Street to post a book and card to Rowan. She had fallen from a seesaw yesterday and broken her wrist. Today she went back to the hospital to have the bones set.</p>
        Afterwards Angela continued modifying curtains and I started putting up one of the large shelves in the study.
