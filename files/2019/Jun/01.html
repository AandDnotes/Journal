        <h1>Saturday 1st June</h1>
        <p>My 71st birthday! Turning 70 was bad enough, but now being in my seventies is a bit much. Anyway, it was a gloriously warm and sunny day and we had an excellent day out. We took the MG to the Amberley chalk pits museum where the Floral Fringe fair was being held (today and tomorrow). Owners of classic cars were asked to register because there is limited space on site. I was too late, but we were able to park in a 'classic car' area relatively close to the entrance.</p>
        <p>We arrived just after eleven and did a quick tour of the fair (which took over an hour) before going back to the car to collect our lunch. We sat on a bench in the shade to eat our picnic and then explored the fair and the museum buildings in more detail. We found both David Wright and Simon Keeble on the Jensen display.</p>
        <p>We finished with a ride on one of the narrow gauge steam trains that was operating, going from one end of the site to the other and back again. We then drove home, arriving at 4:30 and having done 27 miles in the MG.</p>
        <p>When we got home we had just missed Victoria; they went to Home Depot to make a golf game. So we spoke to them for a relatively short while after our dinner.</p>
        <p>To my surprise and delight I had seven birthday cards, three made by Rowan, Austin and Juniper.</p>
