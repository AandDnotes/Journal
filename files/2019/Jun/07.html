        <h1>Friday 7th June</h1>
        <p>A major step forward today in the unpacking stakes. I unpacked as many boxes as I could in the study, leaving only one (half full) and one half-size box that I took out to the garage. These are mainly modelling tools and equipment. We were then able to move the Z-bed from the dining room to the study, after I had laid out the piece of carpet that had been left there.</p>
        <p>Angela went to Pamela's funeral just before lunch, having got very wet when walking down to the library. After dinner I drove to Greg's in Horsham to meet with him and Norman to discuss the IET social event.</p>
