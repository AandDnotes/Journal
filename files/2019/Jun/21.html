        <h1>Friday 21st June</h1>
        <p>The longest day (or perhaps its tomorrow), so the days get shorter from here on! Actually it was a fine, sunny day. Some threatening clouds at some points, but it stayed dry and warm.</p>
        <p>The main event of the day was completion on the sale of Rosemary Avenue, at last. Angela took the spare keys and some notes round this morning and then the call from the solicitor came through just before three. So Angela took the final key down to the agents. She should get the cheque on Tuesday and we now need to sort out adjustments to the inheritance tax.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning changing addresses for Dad's pensions and savings accounts. So we are now almost there.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was more about cleaning. While I cleaned out the gutters, Angela vacuumed. Then I cleaned the filters on the vacuum cleaner that we had retrieved from Rosemary Avenue. I doubt that they had ever been cleaned.</p>
