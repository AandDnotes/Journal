        <h1>Saturday 8th June</h1>
        <p>A breezy and mainly dry day. After I walked to the High Street, to buy a newspaper, we drove to the Ashurst Village Hall where the local WI were holding a coffee morning and plant sale. Angela bought some nerines and we had coffee and cake. When we got back I did the weekly accounts and Angela continued modifying curtains.</p>
        <p>Later we booked our tickets to San Francisco and spoke with Victoria. I also spent some time getting the printer connected to the new router. We had received a revised quote for the bathroom bits (including a 15% discount) and I arranged for a plumber to call next week to give us an installation quote.</p>
