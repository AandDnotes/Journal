        <h1>Saturday 29th June</h1>
        <p>The hottest day of the year, again! There was not a cloud in the sky all day, but it was too hot to do anything in the slightest demanding. Our slightly round about walk to the newsagents, before ten o'clock, was demanding enough.</p>
        <p>So it was a day for doing quiet, sitting down jobs. That meant the weekly accounts, ordering IET flyers and sorting out photos fro the social, as well as sitting int he shade reading the paper. Luckily, one or other of the two gardens has enough shade to sit out.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned the YMCA in Worthing about our wardrobes. They are booked to collect them Friday week. But I need to assemble them in the garage so that they can load them straight on to their van. While talking to them someone called to collect the second long tree lopper, so now we have none. Later in the afternoon we checked the electric lawn rake and I advertised that on Freecycle.</p>
        <p>Apart from talking with Victoria (they are currently with Gene and Claudia in Missouri), most of the afternoon was spent in the garage trying to make space to assemble the wardrobes. I started dismantling old kitchen units that were in the garage when we arrived. The parts will need to go to the tip.</p>
