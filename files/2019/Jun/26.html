        <h1>Wednesday 26th June</h1>
        <p>An early start after a poor night's sleep. I was up at 5:30 and left at 6:45 for Mike's at Woodmancote, arriving just after Hamish. Mike and I spent most of the day judging projects at Big Bang SE and Hamish manned the IET stand.</p>
        <p>While I was out, Angela went walking with her WI friends and later the man came to fix the oven. He replaced the element. I got home around 4:30.</p>
