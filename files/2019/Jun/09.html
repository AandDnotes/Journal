        <h1>Sunday 9th June</h1>
        <p>The day started as a usual Sunday. We did a little moving around of chest of draws in the spare bedroom before Angela went to church. I connected the laptop to the new router and did some backups. Then I removed the old mortar from the loose coping stones and a brick on the front wall. After lunch I mixed some mortar and fixed them back.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Rowan and Paul. She still has a temporary cast on her arm and goes back to the hospital on Tuesday for, hopefully, a hard cast.</p>
        <p>After that I sprayed the lower part of the drive with weed killer. We will see what happens to the weeds!</p>
