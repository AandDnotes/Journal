        <h1>Saturday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>A gloriously sunny day. In fact a little too warm for work out in the sun. However, Angela worked in the garden in the shade.</p>
        <p>We started with a round about walk to the newsagents. I also asked the estate agent to collect the 'for sale' board. I then did the weekly accounts before trying to contact TalkTalk, but the broadband connection went down! So I tried to get the petrol strimmer working so as to put the vegetation up the twitten. However, I couldn't get it started. I had to reduce (if not fix) a petrol leak, the plug was sparking and fuel was getting to the cylinder, but it only fired once. I also removed the breather in the fuel cap, since it seems to have 'melted'.</p>
        <p>So I used the sickle and dug out the soil from half the side of the garage (the easy half). During the afternoon we spoke with Victoria and Austin, who had enjoyed his robotics camp and his cub camps.</p>
