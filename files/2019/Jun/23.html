        <h1>Sunday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the usual the usual backups and then went back to digging out the twitten alongside the garage. Although it was overcast, it was warm and humid, so I left the last part until after lunch.</p>
        <p>Angela continued to work in the garden and later in the afternoon we talked with Paul and Rowan.</p>
