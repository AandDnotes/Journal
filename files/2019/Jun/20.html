        <h1>Thursday 20th June</h1>
        <p>Our weekly shopping day has become somewhat multi-purpose of late and today was no exception. We called into the Greenhouse to drop off some curtains and paintings on the way to Victoria Grand. Then, on the way back, we stopped in Worthing to deliver a change of address form to the Nationwide and to change Juniper's T-shirt for a larger one. Angela also bought two T-shirts in Debenhams. Then it was on to do the weekly groceries shop.</p>
        <p>When we got home I found 11 people who wanted the motor mower. So I chose one who seemed able to collect it today. And he did. So now a little more space in the garage. Four people are interested int he loppers, so we'll see if they can go too.</p>
