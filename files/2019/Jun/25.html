        <h1>Tuesday 25th June</h1>
        <p>I spent the morning and a little of the afternoon cleaning and lubricating the windows and doors. I couldn't get the locking mechanism on the top window in our bedroom to move, even after lubrication.</p>
        <p>Two 'window fixers' called to look at the sliding patio door (that doesn't slide very well) and also looked at the bedroom window. I then fixed two screw eyes to the wall in the front garden so that Angela could tie up a bush.</p>
        <p>Then it was quick paint of waterproofer on the seams of the TC's hood, before I replaced the spark plug in the strimmer. It then started first pull! So I strimmed the twitten along our fence and then removed some weeds on the drive.</p>
