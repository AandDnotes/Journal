        <h1>Saturday 7th September</h1>
        <p>We started with a walk to buy a newspaper and, since it was market day in Steyning, some cooking and eating apples. Angela then worked in the garden and I looked at changing the blade on Lynn's mower. However, it was the wrong type, so I sharpened the old blade. After lunch Angela continued in the garden and I cleared weeds from the drive, stopping in the middle to talk briefly to Victoria. They were about to go off to Home Depot to make 'a plant pot'.</p>
