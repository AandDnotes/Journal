        <h1>Thursday 26th September</h1>
        <p>We got off fairly early start to visit Dad at Victoria Grand and were able to show him a photo of Alan's new puppy. So we got to Sainsbury's early to do the weekly groceries shop and therefore were home earlier than usual.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela went to have her hair cut and then I went off to Brighton for a Gift Oversight Group meeting. It did not take long and I was home before four o'clock. When I got back we decided that the fridge/freezer was broken. I powered it off and on in case something needed to be reset, but no joy. So we went to Storrington to see if we could get a replacement. However, it seems that the same hight fridge/freezer is no longer available. They are either lower or too high for the available space.</p>
        <p>After looking at the options we decided to bring the old fridge in from the garage and buy a small (table top) freezer to stand on top. So we ordered one from Curry's, for delivery on Monday. We also paid them to remove the old fridge/freezer. When the kitchen is revamped we will probably install an integrated fridge/freezer.</p>
