        <h1>Friday 13th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to help clean parts of the church before I was out of the shower this morning. I cleared the dining room ready for the arrival of our new furniture and then dealt with some IET schools email.</p>
        <p>After lunch we worked in the garden. Angela made the flower border in the rear garden a bit wider and I fixed wires to the fence. Then our dining room furniture arrived. I had to remove the chair seats to as to remove the plastic wrapping.</p>
