        <h1>Thursday 5th September</h1>
        <p>For some reason we felt very tired today. We tried to catch up on a few things this morning and then after lunch went to a garden centre, where Angela looked for some plants and I called next door to buy some oil and 'lead' additive.</p>
        <p>When we got home Angela did some cooking and I fixed the notice board in the kitchen to the wall.</p>
