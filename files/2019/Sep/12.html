        <h1>Thursday 12th September</h1>
        <p>We were back to our usual Thursday today. We started at Victoria Grand to see Dad, who seemed well. He wrote birthday cards for Teddy and Juniper. We then went into Worthing, where Angela bought a coat.</p>
        <p>After a short stop at Morrisons to buy more plants, we did our groceries shopping at Sainsbury's (and another plant from B&Q). Consequently it was very late by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>So Angela did some gardening after lunch and I dealt with a lot of IET-related email. I also got the last place on October's Wanderers run from/to Parham House.</p>
