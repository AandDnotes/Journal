        <h1>Sunday 1st September</h1>
        <p>We had a quieter day today. After a late breakfast we walked round to the nearest playground, let the children play and then had a game of frisbee. Although it was still early, we drove into downtown Davis to the 'Black Bear Diner' for lunch. It was very busy (we had a half hour wait for a table) and the food was not very good, although the children enjoyed it. So it was quite late when we got home.</p>
        <p>We then did things inside and out, including lego building, before the children went in the pool. After a 'cheese and biscuits' supper Juniper took herself to bed early and went to sleep, Austin stayed up until about nine, watching Brandon play a computer game.</p>
