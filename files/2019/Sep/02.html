        <h1>Monday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>Today was really about finishing our packing, saying goodbye and starting our journey home. We left Catalina drive at midday, with everyone in the car. They dropped us at the railway station in Davis and the 12:27 Capitol Corridor train arrived on time. The train was very busy, but we just managed to find two seats together, the seats before the engine! We bought some not very good filled rolls from the buffet car. The train then had to stop just north of Martinez, when the bridge over the Carquinez Strait was up, to allow a ship to sail underneath. We were only delayed for ten minutes and at Richmond we transferred to the BART. That was equally busy since it too was operating a Sunday timetable because it was Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Anyway, we got to San Fransisco Airport at about 3:30 and our 6:30 flight boarded at 5:30. So we had time for a coffee and a cake. The flight took off on time and so somewhere over the atlantic it became Tuesday.</p>
