        <h1>Tuesday 10th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street I uncovered the TC and checked the oil, plugs and tyre pressures. I also charged the battery and checked that there were no petrol leaks when the pump was turned on. Since I have some 'lift the dot' pins I looked at replacing the one on the driver's door. It seems that it is only screwed into the hardboard backing of the lining. So I put a small plug in the hole and replaced the pin.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took two paintings to the framer, but he was closed until next week! So we went on to a floor covering shop in Findon Valley to look at Karndean. We then went to two garden centres where Angela bought bulbs, basket plants and a honeysuckle.</p>
