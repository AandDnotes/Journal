        <h1>Tuesday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>After a sleepless (short) night we were given Norwegian's 'universal' light meal; a filled roll and a piece of cake. However, we landed at about ten past twelve, twenty minutes early. Russell brought us home, arriving at 1:30. So the journey took us 21.5 hours door-to-door.</p>
        <p>I walked to the Coop to buy some milk and a small loaf and later we went back down and bought some fish and chips. We were very tired, so had an early night.</p>
