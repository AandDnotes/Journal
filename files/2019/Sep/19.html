        <h1>Thursday 19th September</h1>
        <p>Today was busy, with us trying to fit two day's worth of errands in one day, since the Panda goes in for a service and MoT tomorrow. We were fairly early at Victoria Grand and then called into Morrisons to buy plants on our way to Lyons Farm. I printed a couple of photos and we did the weekly groceries shop.</p>
        <p>So after lunch we did Friday's trips. We started at Dunelm, went on to Halfords and B&amp;Q, then went to the tip and finally Lidl before coming home. We bought some plate racks for the sideboard and a shade for the lamp on the sideboard. Then it was brake fluid and a water butt before we dumped the bird bath from the front garden and the oil from the TC. Angela bought some items from Lidl for the church homeless collection.</p>
        <p>When we got home I installed the the water butt in the walled garden. Now we just need to see if it fills when it rains.</p>
