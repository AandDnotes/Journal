        <h1>Friday 27th September</h1>
        <p>Today was windy, with repeated heavy rain showers for most of the day. Which wasn't ideal for Angela's McMillan coffee morning. I took her down to the church with her cakes and other things in the car. Then later in the morning, between showers, I walked down for coffee and cake. Luckily I got home between the showers as well.</p>
        <p>I ordered new brake bleed nipples and dust covers and 'horseshoe' clips from the Octagon Club and investigated the tariffs offered by Octopus Energy. It was later in the day before Angela could get into the garden, where she raked the back lawn, and I went into the garage. I fitted the oil filter and drain plug and refitted the front brake drums and wheels.</p>
