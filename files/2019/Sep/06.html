        <h1>Friday 6th September</h1>
        <p>A mainly pottering day. After a late start Angela worked in the garden and I caught up with the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>In the evening we went to Felicity and John's to meet the neighbours. Actually the only neighbours were Lynn from next door, Barbara from one side of F&J and Christina and Phil from the other. The rest of the people (about five) were from elsewhere in Steyning. Christina and Phil are a nice and interesting couple.</p>
