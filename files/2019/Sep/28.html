        <h1>Saturday 28th September</h1>
        <p>For a Saturday we were out unusually early. Although we went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and go to the butchers, we went early to go to the health centre to get our flu jabs.</p>
        <p>Before lunch Angela worked in the garden and I topped up the brake fluid, replaced the driver's side carpet, filled the engine with oil and lowered the car to the ground. After lunch Angela was again in the garden and I replaced the tonneau floor and hood and took the car for a short run to warm up the engine. This was just my usual figure of eight, but with a start going up the hill (because a car was parked opposite to the right). When I got back I removed the plugs and checked the tappet clearance. None needed adjusting.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Victoria et al (for quite a long time). I then did the weekly accounts while Angela cooked dinner.</p>
