        <h1>Sunday 8th September</h1>
        <p>A day spent indoors, in spite of it being sunny and dry. Angela went to church while I answered some IET email and did the weekly and monthly accounts. After lunch Angela widened the flower borders in the walled garden by removing a strip of turf and I 'messed around' with photos and videos, trying to get them on to the iPad. I sort of succeeded, but one photo still shows as a frame from a very old video (although double clicking it shows the correct photo) and I had to load the video clips into another area of Photos (the video area). I also managed to set the location of a number of photos of Lake, Tahoe, Davis, Yosemite and the Big Sur so that they show up on the map in Photos.</p>
        <p>In the middle of this we spoke to Paul and Rowan and agreed that we would try to visit them on Thursday 3rd October, returning on the 8th.</p>
