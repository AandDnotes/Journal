        <h1>Wednesday 4th September</h1>
        <p>Today was about trying to get back into some form of normality. We started by visiting Dad, a day earlier than usual, and then went into Worthing, mainly to pay in a cheque. We also found the weekly market and so, after calling in to Pollards to arrange delivery of our dining room furniture, we went back to the car for some bags and returned to the market to buy fruit and vegetables. We then went on to Lyons Farm to do a weekly shop.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela worked in the garden and I cut the grass, followed by emptying another box in the garage. We had a fairly early dinner so that we could go to the Steyning Centre to see a film, Red Joan. I was not sure about it, but it was very good.</p>
