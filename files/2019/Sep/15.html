        <h1>Sunday 15th September</h1>
        <p>Another fine, warm day. While Angela went to church I removed the wire netting from the top of the wall in the rose garden.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden and I found that the 'lift the dot' on the driver's door had been fitted upside down. So I refitted it and replaced the pin with one with a longer screw that, hopefully, will grip the plastic plug more firmly.</p>
        <p>As usually on a Sunday we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
