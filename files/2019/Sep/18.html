        <h1>Wednesday 18th September</h1>
        <p>A bits and pieces day. Angela went to table tennis after lunch and I filled the TC's differential and gear box with oil, removing the gear box cover so as to get the filler cap off.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I booked our tickets for our trip to Paul's and emailed the plumber about dates and Karndean.</p>
