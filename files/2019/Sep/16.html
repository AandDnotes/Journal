        <h1>Monday 16th September</h1>
        <p>Angela needed to leave early after lunch for her WI meeting, so I went to Victoria Grand on my own, in the TC. The object was to drain the engine oil while it was still hot. So when I got back I removed the sump plug and the oil filter. Leaving the final drops to drip into a plastic tub I put the car up on axle stands in preparation for the rest of the service jobs.</p>
        <p>The speaker at Angela's WI meeting talked about sleep (and the lack of it), so I scanned part of the article in Saturday's paper and sent it to Victoria.</p>
