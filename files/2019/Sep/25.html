        <h1>Wednesday 25th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis this afternoon, but I only went as far as the garage. I rained most of the day. So I spent all morning dealing with the IET newsletter and other IET and Barefoot email. I also moved some money around to top up Dad's account and give Juniper a birthday present.</p>
        <p>After Angela got home I went in the garage and re-fitted the rear brake drums and wheels, adjusting the brakes in the process. Later in the evening I spoke with Alan.</p>
