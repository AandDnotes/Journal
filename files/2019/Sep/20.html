        <h1>Friday 20th September</h1>
        <p>It was an early start (for us) because I had to take the Panda to the garage for a service and for it to have an MoT test. They phoned not long afterwards to say that it needed new front brake pads and discs. Even then, the work was done by mid afternoon. As I left the garage so I got caught up in the school children's climate change protest, which essentially closed the High Street. So I turned around and came home the back way.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the day working on the TC. I checked and topped-up the dampers, greased the prop shaft universal joints, the front suspension and the hand brake cables. I also dismantled the rear hubs. There was more grease in them than I had expected, although everything seemed tight. I think it was the grease from the bearing. However, I could feel some movement in the bearing carrier! I tried tightening the nut holding them to the back axle, but could not move them. I can only assume that it is movement in the bearings themselves and so must consider replacing them (with sealed bearings).</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden, but spent most of the afternoon taking bulbs to WI members and getting cheques signed.</p>
