        <h1>Wednesday 11th September</h1>
        <p>Today I drove the Panda to Midhurst for lunch! I had intended driving the TC to Adversane to join the Sussex Wanderers, ending up in Midhurst, but when I started the car this morning it was not happy. The engine was clearly not running on all cylinders. So I decided to investigate and only go to Midhurst for lunch.</p>
        <p>I checked that there was a spark at each plug (although they seemed a bit weak), checked the contact points gap and looked at the static timing (roughly by eye). Then I put it back together and ran fine! By this time there was not enough time to take the TC, since I need some petrol. So I drove the Panda. It was a long way to go for lunch, but the food was good.</p>
        <p>Angela arrived home from her table tennis an hour after I got home.</p>
