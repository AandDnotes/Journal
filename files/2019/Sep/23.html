        <h1>Monday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>Today was the Autumn Equinox and the first day with rain (overnight and during the afternoon) for some time. The Methodist Church had collected items for a homeless charity in Worthing and so we collected the bags of items and took them with us into Worthing. After visiting Dad at Victoria Grand we parked and carried the bags of items to the shop in Montague Street. After a coffee, a visit to the bank (or two) and to Wilko to buy some bulb fibre (we had the wheeled basket with us) we came home, via a distributor of seals and gaskets. I had hoped that they would have a seal for the MG's oil filter, but no.</p>
        <p>After lunch I walked to the High Street to get my hair cut and then we had a very short call with Juniper to wish her a happy birthday; she is four today.</p>
        <p>I then completed the September newsletter and posted a blog entry in the hope of winning some 'old brand' give-aways.</p>
