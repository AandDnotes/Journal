        <h1>Saturday 21st September</h1>
        <p>Today is forecast to be the last of our warm (even hot) sunny days. It is due to rain tomorrow as a low pressure system sweeps across us.</p>
        <p>It certainly was warm and sunny. We spent most of the morning outside, walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then on to the Steyning Centre to look at the first steps in the development of a neighbourhood plan. I then only had time to do the weekly accounts before lunch, although Angela did some more work in the garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch I continued with servicing the MG, although apart form greasing the front spring eyes I didn't achieve any more. I had planned to replace the brake fluid, but I haven't been able to move the bleed nipples. I might have to fit new ones, then I can 'mangle' the old ones while removing them.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes chat with Victoria we went down to the Methodist church to help put out tables and chairs for their harvest lunch tomorrow. Victoria will call back after their lunch.</p>
