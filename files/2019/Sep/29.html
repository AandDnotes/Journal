        <h1>Sunday 29th September</h1>
        <p>A mainly wet and very windy day. Angela went to church as usual and I tidied up various things and prepared for the IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch it stopped raining for a while, so Angela went in the garden and I went in the garage. I put the rocker box on and replaced the plugs, then tidied up. Just before we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
