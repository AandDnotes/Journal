        <h1>Sunday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church as usual and stayed for lunch. So I cooked myself venison burgers with flat chips and spinach.</p>
        <p>I spent all morning putting together the September newsletter. It was quite a struggle with the Adestra system.</p>
        <p>Angela was home by three thirty and we spoke to Paul a little later. I also looked at the bleed nipples on the brake cylinders. The parts catalogues show that the front nipples are 7/16" UNF and the rear are 5/16". The rear ones are certainly smaller than those at the front, but a 7/16" AF spanner is a little loose. I also gave each another squirt of WD40.</p>
