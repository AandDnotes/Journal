        <h1>Monday 9th September</h1>
        <p>Angela was due to help wash up at the lunch club this morning, but was asked to go in early to help in preparation. Meanwhile, I went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. I showed him our holiday photos (again), including some that he had not seen before. However, all seemed new to him.</p>
        <p>After lunch I looked at the various options for travelling to Berkenwouder, with driving and using the Harwich ferry the cheapest.</p>
        <p>Later I went to the WSMGOC.</p>
