        <h1>Saturday 14th September</h1>
        <p>A fine, sunny and warm late summer day. We had intended taking the TC to Adversane and then along to 'Architectural Plants' for coffee in their cafe. However, firstly the car started running badly (as it had last Wednesday) just as we were about to turn out of Penlands Way. I turned around and, with the engine now running better, did a quick loop. All was well, so we went off to the petrol station at Beeding. I have concluded that since the car has been standing for a while, some residual diesel had worked its way through to the carburetters.</p>
        <p>Secondly, we found that the bypass was closed between the Bramber and Beeding roundabouts. This meant that all the traffic was going through Bramber, resulting in long queues. So we decided to change our destination to Camelia Botna, which meant that we could continue up to Henfield and then Partridge Green (to buy a newspaper) and then up to the garden centre. It was also an opportunity for Angela to buy some plants.</p>
        <p>I then just had time to do the weekly accounts (including reconciliation against the statement) before lunch. Afterwards we worked in the garden, Angela planting and me removing the wire netting from the top of the fence in the rear garden. We then spoke, for quite a long time, to Victoria et al.</p>
