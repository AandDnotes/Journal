        <h1>Monday 30th September</h1>
        <p>It was a fairly quiet morning, but a busy afternoon. Our mini freezer was due for delivery any time between 7am and 7pm, so Angela stayed home while I went to visit Dad at Victoria Grand. When I got home I updated Dad's finance prediction that keeps a check on his future ability to pay his rent.</p>
        <p>I was setting up the new pot in the front garden when the freezer arrived and the old fridge/freezer taken away. So we moved the fridge into the kitchen and started up the small freezer placed on top. I also put the TC's hood up and put the cover on.</p>
