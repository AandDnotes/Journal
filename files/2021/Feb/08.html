        <h1>Monday 8th February</h1>
        <p>When we woke there was a slight layer of snow that covered the road, but not the grass. However, it stayed around zero all day and at times was quite breezy. So we didn't go outside, apart from Angela retrieving the bins after they had been emptied.</p>
        <p>I finally got around to writing and sending out notes from Thursday's PEI group meeting. I also replied to our Italian student about providing a reference for his industrial placement. I also asked the PhD student if she is interested in the Communications Officer role. She replied later with a couple of questions.</p>
        <p>Once again I spent a lot of time (probably too much) experimenting with python code. But I did phone Dad after lunch.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the WSMGOC Zoom meeting.</p>
