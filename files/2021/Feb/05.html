        <h1>Friday 5th February</h1>
        <p>We showered this morning, so it was ten o'clock before we got going. So, after doing a few minor things we had an early cup of coffee and then went for a walk. It was mainly sunny and calm, so we went up the steep path at the end of Ingram Road to the Bostal, up the 'snake' path and then on up to the top. Workmen were strimming the path round the top of the horseshoe, so we went on up to the South Downs Way and down Sopers Lane. We were out for an hour and forty minutes.</p>
        <p>After lunch, since the weather forecast is for very cold weather over the weekend, I investigated the point where the TV cables come into the sitting room. We've had quite a few woodlouse in that corner, so I stripped off the tape over the entry of two of cable and filled the holes with brown mastic. The very old tube of mastic split, so I had to use my finger! It doesn't look very neat, but hopefully it will stop anything crawling in.</p>
        <p>I had emailed someone about the possibility of a talk on SMRs and I had a reply. So I answered his questions. We also each received letter from the NHS asking us to login and book an appointment to have a COVID-19 vaccination. However, the nearest place was Brighton. The letter did say that we could wait for a call from our surgery, which we will do.</p>
