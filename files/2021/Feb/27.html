        <h1>Saturday 27th February</h1>
        <p>Another glorious day, if not quite as warm as yesterday. As usual on a Saturday we started with a walk to the High Street. Again as usual, I bought a newspaper and some rolls and Angela went into the Coop for a few things.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I started the TC and ran the engine for 15 minutes. I really didn't think it was going to start, but it eventually fired. I also drove it out and back into the garage to free the back shoes and moved it slightly further back because it seemed to be settling on flat points on the tyres. While waiting for the engine to warm up I checked the tyre pressures on both cars.</p>
        <p>I had planned to wash the front garage door after lunch, but we called Victoria as usual and spent three hours on FaceTime, initially with Juniper and then mostly with Victoria. By the end it was too late to go outside, so it was back to the newspaper.</p>
