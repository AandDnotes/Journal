        <h1>Wednesday 17th February</h1>
        <p>Again there was too much rain to go for a walk. However, I spent most of the morning finishing my newsletter. But it was rejected and after making the correction I don't know if anyone will approve it, since Julie is away.</p>
        <p>Later I arranged to meet our new Communications Officer. And it seems that we found a way to make her an administrator on our web site. I also read the text from Subu on 'Net Zero'. I need to concoct a reply to get her to modify it.</p>
        <p>So overall it was a day centred around IET things.</p>
