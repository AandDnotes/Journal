        <h1>Thursday 25th February</h1>
        <p>In spite of the forecast, we had no rain today, although it was overcast. I started by checking that our money had arrived in Angela's new OakNorth bond account and then made some corrections to my Savings spreadsheet. We then spent the rest of the morning talking with Kate and Dick, catching up on each other's news.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned Dad. Then Angela delivered something to someone the other side of Steyning. Later I had a short Zoom call with Ferheen to talk about the next stage of changes to the Sussex Network web site. Then, after dinner, I attended the IET talk on IoT and Bloodhound. Quite interesting, although the speaker's definition of IoT was not quite what I thought it was.</p>
