        <h1>Wednesday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>It was raining again this morning, which stopped just before lunchtime. So we went for a walk around the roads later in the afternoon. We just went up the road, along Laines Road back down to Dog Lane and home via Penlands Way. It only took half an hour.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was just a case of checking things, updating things and emailing people. I also did a little more experimentation with tkinter.</p>
