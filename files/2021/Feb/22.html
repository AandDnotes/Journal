        <h1>Monday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>It was forecast to be dry and warmer today, but it was damp and, according to the outside thermometer, it did not get above ten degrees. So we didn't go out. Angela spent the morning writing up notes from her WI treasurers meeting, typing them up later int eh afternoon. Meanwhile I closed Angela's Post Office account (a bond had matured) and opened her an OakNorth bond.</p>
        <p>I 'played' with my micro:bit/pi project for a while, taking another video. I also installed a python editor with a micro:bit option and read a little about event handling. My February newsletter was approved and our new Communications Officer sent some thoughts about our web site.</p>
        <p>Today was also the day that a 'roadmap' for the easing of COVID-19 restrictions was spelt out, with five weeks between each stage so as to measure the effect. If all goes well, all restrictions could be eased by the end of June.</p>
