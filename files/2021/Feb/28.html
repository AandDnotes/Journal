        <h1>Sunday 28th February</h1>
        <p>The morning started very overcast and misty, but it soon cleared and the sun came out. So while Angela was at her Zoom church service I started cleaning the garage door. Since the door doesn't get any sunlight, it acquires some green mould. Some Flash and an old washing up brush works quite well. I finished just in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>A little earlier than usual we spoke with Paul. It was just as sunny with them.</p>
