        <h1>Monday 15th February</h1>
        <p>The cold has gone and it rained overnight, but we didn't go outside. So it was a day of doing bits and pieces. An email here, a modification to a spreadsheet there.</p>
        <p>I added another 'how to' and this afternoon we both had Zoom calls, mine with the Eurotherm group and Angela's for WI. This morning I phoned Dad.</p>
