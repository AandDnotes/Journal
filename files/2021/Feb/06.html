        <h1>Saturday 6th February</h1>
        <p>I started with a walk to the High Street to get a newspaper. Meanwhile, Angela delivered some things to an elderly lady from church. All parts of the Telegraph had not arrived, so I bought a copy of the Times.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and 'playing' with my python code. Most of the rest of the day was spent reading the paper until, although just before we dished up our main course at dinner, we had a quick chat with Victoria et al in their new house. Austin took us for a quick tour, although he was n=more interested in showing us that they had moved his toys. They had about two feet of snow, but are expecting their heavier furniture to be moved on Tuesday. In the mean time they are staying in the new house, using an airbed.</p>
