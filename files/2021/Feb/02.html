        <h1>Tuesday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>Walking to the health centre (to the pharmacy) before lunch and doing our Dutch lessons after lunch took most of the day. Although the weather was brightening up when we left, it started raining before we got home and we got quite wet. In addition to my repeat prescription (which apparently was the last automatic renewal) I bought Angela some dental floss and me a pot of Epaderm ointment. Years ago I was prescribed the ointment and having finished the pot I now discovered that it is quite expensive.</p>
        <p>Before and after going our I worked on the cloakroom door catch and handle. I lubricated the catch and replaced the spring in the inside handle, which had broken.</p>
