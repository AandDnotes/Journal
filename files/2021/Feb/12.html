        <h1>Friday 12th February</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but cold day with a brisk breeze that made it feel even more cold. After an early mug of coffee we went for a walk across the the cricket field, down the Rifle Range, up the slope and down to Mouse Lane, before coming back across the cricket field. That essentially took the rest of the morning.</p>
        <p>I copied my python program to the Raspberry Pi and modified it so that it would work if it couldn't find a micro:bit. It couldn't find it because I only have one micro usb cable. The pi can only be powered using such a cable and the only usb port on the micro:bit is also a micro. But I only have one!</p>
