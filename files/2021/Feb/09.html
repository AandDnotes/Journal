        <h1>Tuesday 9th February</h1>
        <p>Another smattering of snow greeted us this morning. However, it had melted (mostly) by the time we needed to go out. But it was bitterly cold. So the morning was spent paying Dad's newspaper bill and sending emails. We now seem to have a Communications Officer for our Sussex Network.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took a ride to Henfield to have our first COVID-19 vaccination. It was well organised and after our obligatory 15 minute rest we drove home for a cup of tea. We were given the Pfizer vaccine and our second jab is scheduled, also at Henfield, towards the end of April.</p>
        <p>After our mug of tea I drafted another 'how to' on problems you might encounter on the iMac.</p>
