        <h1>Sunday 21st February</h1>
        <p>A much brighter and warmer day. In fact, the sun came out on occasions during the afternoon. While Angela attended her Zoom church service I re-worked the 'circular' design for the walled garden. Angela was still not impressed. I also did a little more of my write-up on my micro:bit to pi communications project.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk. Up the horseshoe path from Newham Lane, down the 'snake' path and down the Bostal Road. There were quite a few people out. That brought us home in time to talk with Paul and Rowan. Krista had posted a photo earlier showing them having lunch outside in the sunshine. I then tested my micro:bit to pi compass and took a video of it. The movement of the image was very haphazard.</p>
