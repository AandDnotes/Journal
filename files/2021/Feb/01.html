        <h1>Monday 1st February</h1>
        <p>There are two things that are good about February; it is the shortest month and the next month is March. But it started cold and grey.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the Post Office to get a card from Dad to Aunt Joan and some stamps while I moved money into the new Skipton BS 3-yr bond and checked the Kent Reliance regular savings money transfer. I also started updating the monthly accounts using my new spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon I joined the 'Eurotherm group' chat, most of which was a discussion on the use of hydrogen as a fuel. I then tried to phone Dad, but just got a message asking to leave name and number and they would call back. They didn't. I also finished updating the monthly accounts.</p>
