        <h1>Sunday 7th February</h1>
        <p>We had a slight flurry of snow this morning morning, but it didn't settle. On the other hand, Paul et al had a few centimetres and Victoria et al had two feet!</p>
        <p>Apart from speaking with Paul and Rowan later in the afternoon, Angela attended her Zoom church service and I read the paper and experimented further with python. Neither of us went outside apart from when Angela put out the bins.</p>
