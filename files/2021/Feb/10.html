        <h1>Wednesday 10th February</h1>
        <p>After an early mug of coffee we walked to the High Street. Angela went in the Coop to get some fruit, veg, rolls and cold meet, while I went into the Post Office to send a card to Victoria and get some cash. Neither of us have any reaction to our COVID-19 jab, although we are both feeling a little tired.</p>
        <p>The rest of my day was spent reading, sending email and trying to resolve iMac problems. I researched coking coal and steel-making in preparation for the 'Eurothrm' Zoom meeting, replied to our new Communications Officer and emailed the committee to tell them about her. In between I tried to resolve a problem that Angela was having with Safari. In the end I restarted the machine!</p>
        <p>While Angela was applying for her new driving licence, I combined my python code for displaying the compass image and the usb interface.</p>
