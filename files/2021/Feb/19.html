        <p>In spite of the weather forecast it didn't start raining until mid afternoon, although it was cloudy all day. Nevertheless, we did not go out.</p>
        <p>I spent some time adding to my notes on our life during lockdown and on my career at Ferranti. A lot of this was done while Angela was on a WI Zoom call and talking with their president.</p>
