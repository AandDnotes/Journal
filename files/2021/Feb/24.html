        <h1>Wednesday 24th February</h1>
        <p>The forecast was for this to be the warmest day of the year so far. We probably got to 12 degrees, but it was mainly overcast and with a breeze. However, we did go for a walk around the lower horseshoe after lunch. The breeze had dropped and the sun did shine on and off.</p>
        <p>We transferred Â£8,000 from Angela's RBS account into Dad's current account so that he has enough money for the next three months until his NS&I bonds mature. However, we are still waiting to hear that money has been received by OakNorth for Angela's new bond.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended the events sub-committee meeting. I only got a couple of actions over and above getting two speakers.</p>
