        <h1>Sunday 14th February</h1>
        <p>It was another cold day. At least I think is was, since I didn't put my head outside. Angela did though. She put some washing out, since it was dry and windy.</p>
        <p>Angela attended her Zoom church service and I read the paper and did some investigation of the steps needed to find the usb port into which the micro:bit was plugged. Then I did a little to update to what I had already written.</p>
        <p>This afternoon we spoke with Paul. Rowan has been back at school for four days (Monday was a snow day).</p>
