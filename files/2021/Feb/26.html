        <h1>Friday 26th February</h1>
        <p>It was a glorious day; clear blue sky from sunrise to sunset. So, after morning coffee in the garden, we went for a walk around the upper horseshoe, getting home just before lunch. An hour and twenty minutes was just about enough. Angela had changed the bed and put some washing on before we left.</p>
        <p>I emailed the Sussex Network committee about the changes to the name of our SLOs to Education Officer and then emailed Julie Hudson about details of a 'hybrid' event. Then I 'played' with my micro:bit/pi communication. Simply modifying the heading every half second produced a smooth movement of the image on the python application on the MacBook, so it looks as though it is the reading of the magnetometer that has the variability. I then struggled to get some micro:bit python code in the mu editor to work when downloaded.</p>
