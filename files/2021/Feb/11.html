        <h1>Thursday 11th February</h1>
        <p>Another cold day, but with enough layers it is ok. So before lunch we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe. Luckily the ground, although a little muddy, was quite hard.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent emailing people, mainly IET related. However, having received a letter from the HMRC about the calculation of my tax coding and found that I owe tax on un-taxed interest, I spent a while estimating our annual interest and calculating how much we each have invested. I only have £1,000 tax relief on interest, whereas Angela has £6,000 relief. So we need to move some money to Angela's accounts.</p>
