        <h1>Tuesday 16th February</h1>
        <p>It seemed to rain most of the day, although Angela did manage to get out for a walk later in the afternoon. I spent a lot of the day drafting this month's newsletter. I just have a review of this evening's talk to add, before sending it off to Greg to review.</p>
        <p>There wasn't really any need for me to be a panelist this evening, but I got invited. There was only 66 attendees, but the talk was interesting, even though it was difficult to work out what it was going to be about.</p>
        <p>I took the MacBook into the dining room for the talk, since Angela had a church meeting and so used the study.</p>
