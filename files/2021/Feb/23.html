        <h1>Tuesday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>A mainly sunny day, although we didn't stray beyond the garden. I replied to our new Communications Officer about changes to our web site and then moved money from our bank account (after a bond matured) to Angela's new OakNorth account.</p>
        <p>Later Angela did some work repotting seedings and I printed the latest garden plans and marked out Angela's preferred version with canes and rope. I also did some reading on python communications on the micro:bit and did a couple of experiments.</p>
