        <h1>Saturday 20th February</h1>
        <p>Most of the day was spent either walking, reading the newspaper or talking with Victoria. We started by going to buy a newspaper at Beeding. We returned via the river bank, the footbridge over the river, the Downs Link, the 'cows' field and back down the twitten. We were out for an hour and three quarters. We only had two Visa expenses during the week, so doing the weekly accounts was easy.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They were waiting for the electricians, who was replacing the consumer unit, to turn off the power. I then updated the 'Year Notes' page of our web site to add an entry for 2020. I also phoned Alan. He is still having problems with his stomach and they've had no heating since before Christmas. They are due to have a new boiler fitted early next month.</p>
