        <h1>Saturday 13th February</h1>
        <p>We took the basket on wheels to the High Street this morning. It was sunny, but bitterly cold again. Angela firstly went to the butchers while I bought some rolls. I had previously discovered that the Post Office did not open until 10pm on Saturdays. So after transferring the meat to the 'wheels' and while Angela was in the Coop, I went back to the Post Office to see if they stocked usb cables. They didn't. So I waited for Angela to come out of the Coop, transferred most of her shopping to the 'wheels' and we came home.</p>
        <p>After reading some of the paper, I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts. Updating them with the week's transactions didn't take long, but we had a bank statement and so I reconciled the entries with my spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>After lunch I ordered a (cheap) micro-usb cable. It cost more to have it posted than to buy it. It will take 4-6 days to arrive (perhaps longer since today is a Saturday), but then I will be able to test my micro:bit to Raspberry Pi communication project.</p>
        <p>We were just about to get our pudding when Austin and Juniper called. We then spent an hour and a half talking to them and to Victoria, getting a tour of their new house. Afterwards, we watched a programme on Stonehenge.</p>
