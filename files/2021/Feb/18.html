        <h1>Thursday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off quite early to Sainsbury's to do what has now become our fortnightly supermarket shop. She said that it was quiet when she arrived, but there was a queue at checkout and a long queue of people waiting to get in.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile I replied to our would be author, suggesting that she expands her article into two or three blog posts.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a short walk, keeping to the pavements (apart from walking up the twitten) before I phoned Dad. Then I had a Zoom call with our new Communications Officer. We started by making her an administrator on the web site and talking about some of the things we could do to enhance it.</p>
