        <h1>Thursday 4th February</h1>
        <p>It used to be that we were up and ready to start the day's activities by nine, or half past if we showered. Now it is 9:30 or ten if we shower. So this morning Angela left home just after 9:30 to drive to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop, even though we tried to change it to fortnightly. Meanwhile I had email and phone correspondence with Leaneys about the cloakroom and checked our our Kent Reliance accounts. Our 'easy access' accounts had been closed and the money transferred to our 60-day accounts and we agreed to place an order with Leaneys after some amendments.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent 'playing' with python or other things. After dinner I chaired a PEI group meeting.</p>
