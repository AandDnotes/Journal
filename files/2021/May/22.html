        <h1>Saturday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>At least the wind had dropped. However, it started mainly dry, but became showery from lunchtime, causing the washing to be wetter when Angela brought it in than when it was hung out. And it was hardly warm.</p>
        <p>We started, somewhat later than usual, with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper, but after that only ventured as far as the garage. I did the weekly accounts, but otherwise mainly read. Angela did some dusting and vacuuming and we spent two and a half hours talking with Austin and Victoria. I then checked the tyre pressures and oil and water on the TC, fixing our number 72 in the front window ready for tomorrow.</p>
