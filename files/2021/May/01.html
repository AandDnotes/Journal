        <h1>Saturday 1st May</h1>
        <p>We decided to walk to Hyde Square to buy a newspaper this morning, so, although we were quite late getting going, we walked via Clays Field and St Peters and returned via The Street. We were out for over an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>I then managed to do the weekly accounts and set up this month's table before lunch. After lunch, however, we spent two and a half hours talking with Victoria! In the evening I finished reading the AC book, 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles'.</p>
