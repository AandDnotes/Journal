        <h1>Friday 14th May</h1>
        <p>Not a particularly productive day. We decided to go to M&S to try to buy new slippers (using the Â£5 vouchers that we both had) and then back to Sainsbury's to do the weekly supermarket shop. We left at about 10:30, I bought some slippers, but they didn't have any Angela's size, I sat in the car at Sainsbury's and we got home just before one o'clock.</p>
        <p>Angela was then productive. As well as cooking dinner she baked several batches of biscuits and cut the walled-garden grass in between. Whereas all I did was lower the front of the TC to the ground and put the back up on axle stands. Usually I jack up the front first and then jack up the rear, so there is room to get far enough underneath to position the trolley jack under the differential. With the front on the ground, this was very difficult and I was very tired having done it.</p>
