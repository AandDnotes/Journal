        <h1>Wednesday 19th May</h1>
        <p>We seem to have had a busy day, but I'm not sure that we have achieved very much. We woke a little later than intended. Luckily we dressed before breakfast, since the plumber arrived while we were still eating breakfast.</p>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI group at 9:30 and the plumber (with his helper) had finished before eleven. He will be back early tomorrow. I arranged for the recordings of our last two IET talks to be uploaded to our OneDrive and I edited the earlier one. Then exported it and ran it through Handbrake to reduce its size.</p>
        <p>We spent part of the afternoon in the front garden. I cleared some more weeds from the drive and then clipped a couple of bushes that hang over the pavement. Then we paid the balance of the bill to Leaneys, so that the parts for the cloakroom can be delivered on Friday.</p>
        <p>We didn't have time for a shower this morning, so we had one this evening.</p>
