        <h1>Monday 10th May</h1>
        <p>Angela made a quick visit to the High Street before going off for a coffee morning at the church. They took garden chairs, expecting to sit outside, but went inside. I had a chat with Dad.</p>
        <p>It took quite some time to set up online access to Dad's RCI Bank accounts and then transferred money into his two year bond. I also started investigating how to proceed with setting up an OakNorth account for him.</p>
        <p>Later I joined the 'Eurotherm group' Zoom meeting and after dinner the WSMGOC meeting. Richard Pope gave an overview of his restoration of a TR6.</p>
