        <h1>Friday 28th May</h1>
        <p>The plumber arrived at about 9:30 and Angela went off to do the weekly supermarket shop while I checked Dad's account, but the money that I moved from his RCI account had not yet arrived. Later I went into the garage and started working on the slow running adjustment mechanism. After lunch I finished making and fitting clips to hold the slow running cable and the spring. I had to modify the main clip quite a bit and it is a bit of a bodge, but seems to work.</p>
        <p>It was slightly overcast pretty much all day, but quite warm, with sometimes hazy sunshine.</p>
