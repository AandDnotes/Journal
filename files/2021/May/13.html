        <h1>Thursday 13th May</h1>
        <p>It did not seem like a Thursday today, since neither of us went out to do grocery shopping. Angela went to help clean at the church and after transferring more of Dad's money I went into the garage, put the front of the TC on axle stands and started greasing the front end. I also checked that the tie-rod and drag link would still rotate at full lock.</p>
        <p>Before going out to the garage I also emailed someone from the WSMGOC about fuel leaks from the carburettors.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I finished greasing the front-end and adjusted the front brakes while Angela cut the front grass and the kitchen garden grass. Then I set up the Echo Dot and smart plug that were given to us by TalkTalk when we renewed our account and which arrived just after lunch.</p>
        <p>A little after four I spoke with Dad (their phone was engaged when I had tried earlier). He was still down stairs playing draughts, so we only had a short chat.</p>
