        <h1>Wednesday 5th May</h1>
        <p>Angela was up slightly earlier than usual and went off walking with her WI group before I was out of the shower. I read email, downloaded statements for Dad and had a short play with the flying simulator. However, I had to change the settings (the elevator and ailerons had to be reversed) and then, after a few circuits, the batteries were low.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a half-hour walk, mainly to deliver a WI booklet to someone in Goring Road, although we took a longer route home. Later I downloaded a Phillip K. Dick short story, which didn't take long to read, so I downloaded a slightly longer short story by Dick. I also started collecting photos to add some details to our family history web pages.</p>
