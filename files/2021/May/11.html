        <h1>Tuesday 11th May</h1>
        <p>For me it was a day spent indoors, mainly in front of a screen. I found that one of the RCI accounts had been closed because nothing was put into it in time, even though the letter with the account details said I had 14 days! Having phoned them, it should be rectified, but the payment has been returned and I will need to transfer the money again. I also spoke with Coventry BS, who will send me a pack.</p>
        <p>Some time was spent preparing for this evening's talk. Then we had an early dinner and I led the talk, which wasn't really very good. The speaker's accent was strong and his slides were poor, but we had 275 in the audience.</p>
        <p>Later we had a short chat with Austin to wish him a Happy Birthday, plus a longer talk with Victoria about trees, roofs, camping and kitchen appliances.</p>
