        <h1>Monday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>Today was the Spring Bank Holiday. Not that it affects us much. The weather forecast was for wind and rain later in the day, so we decided to go for a walk before lunch. We went around the upper horseshoe via the steep path from the end of Ingram Road and then the 'snake' path. We were out for an hour and a half. It was occasionally sunny and a little breezy, but the wind was coming from the west, so wasn't too cold. The wind became stronger as the day went on and it started raining at about 7:30.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I checked Ferheen's edit to the recording of last week's talk. Then after lunch I read the latest instalment of from our blogger and read some more of Ayn R's book.</p>
