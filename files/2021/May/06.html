        <h1>Thursday 6th May</h1>
        <p>We started by driving to the Steyning Centre to vote; for West Sussex Council and for the Police and Crime Commissioner. I only discovered yesterday evening that Mike Croker was standing as a Green candidate. It seems that he is already a Horsham councillor.</p>
        <p>I had intended walking home while Angela went on to Sainsbury's, but her hearing aid battery started bleeping, so she drove back home to change it before going to Lyons Farm. So I did not get to walk. The rest of my morning was spent dealing with mainly IET emails.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage and used thread lock on two bolts of each carburettor; the fuel inlet banjo bolt and the bolt holding the flat chamber to the main body. I only lost one fibre washer in the process. Luckily I had a spare.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended an IET Cambridge talk on the programming of quantum computers. The speaker had a strong accent and talk very fast. He covered a lot of ground at a fairly high level, but he described three of the technologies used and basically said that his company is leading a collaboration that is producing python functions to address all levels of the quantum stack that will apply to all the technologies.</p>
