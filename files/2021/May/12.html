        <h1>Wednesday 12th May</h1>
        <p>Being Wednesday, Angela went off with her WI walking group. While she was out I sent some IET emails and had a call from someone at RCI Bank, saying that Dad's 2-year account was now open, but only for today. So I transferred Â£40K into it again. Then I took the TC out for a run via Ashurst, Partridge Green and Henfield, stopping to buy some petrol in Beeding; a total of 17 miles. The car ran well and the thread-locked bolts don't seem to be leaking petrol. However, the front carburettor jet is still leaking.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a two-hour FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. We arranged to meet them for a picnic 'mid-way' towards the end of June.</p>
