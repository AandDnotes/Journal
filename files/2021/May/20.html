        <h1>Thursday 20th May</h1>
        <p>Another early start. The plumber was here at 8:30 again, on his own this time. He went off just before eleven to get materials and before he left at about four had put the sub-frame of the floor in place.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day 'playing' with video recordings of the last two talks. By the end of the day both were edited and uploaded to YouTube. Yesterday's talk, however, was recorded in a lower resolution than previous talks. Also, the image of the speaker is on the side, rather than in the top corner, and so the aspect ratio is 2:1.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to Holmbush to do a smaller weekly shop in M&S, since she had a money off voucher.</p>
