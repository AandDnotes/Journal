        <h1>Wednesday 26th May</h1>
        <p>We had a more relaxed morning, since the plumber was not due to arrive until about midday. So we had breakfast and then showered. In fact I was still in the bathroom (cutting my hair) when Angela left to join her WI walking group. They went up Sopers Lane and around the top horseshoe.</p>
        <p>Another letter arrived from Coventry BS about telephone passwords. I'm not quite sure how that works, but I found that if I log in using my details (I already have savings account with them) I found that I could view Dad's account. And the £10 that I transferred Monday evening was there. So I then moved a further £39,990.</p>
        <p>I ordered a slow running arm spring and cable clamp and two bolts to hold float chambers to carburettors. I looked for material to make the clips and bracket, but could find where I had put my off-cuts of sheet metal. I also cleaned the paintwork on the TC and put on some wax. I still have to clean under the wings.</p>
