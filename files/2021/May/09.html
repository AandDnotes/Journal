        <h1>Sunday 9th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church this morning and I moved the first tranche of Dad's money to one of his new accounts. It was noticeably warmer, with hazy sunshine for a lot of the day. However, the cloud did thicken enough for a few spots of rain around lunchtime.</p>
        <p>Later I 'grubbed out' weeds from part of the drive. I used the wire brush on a pole, since the blow lamp blew out. Angela pottered int eh garden. We then spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
