        <h1>Sunday 30th May</h1>
        <p>Another beautiful day, hardly a breath of wind and, after a cloudy start, a lot of sunshine. Angela went to church while I checked Dad's current account and then phoned RCI to find that withdrawals, if made before 2pm, should get to their destination by 5pm the next working day. So I need to wait until Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I added to my web page on carburettor work and then did some more 'scrubbing' of weeds off the drive. I also replaced the cardboard under the TC from one of the cloakroom cabinet boxes. Whereas after lunch I lifted the rear off-side wheel, removed it and cleaned under the wheel arch. Then I removed the brake drum to check for oil or brake fluid. Luckily there was neither.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
