        <h1>Tuesday 4th May</h1>
        <p>I started by walking down to the pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription. When I got home, Angela went down to the High Street to the Butchers and Coop. Meanwhile I paid Dad's paper bill.</p>
        <p>At lunchtime I had a FaceTime call with Dad. He looked well and we had a good half-hour chat. Later I finished reading Ayn R's book. After diner I called Alan and caught up with him.</p>
