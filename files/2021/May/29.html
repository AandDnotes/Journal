        <h1>Saturday 29th May</h1>
        <p>We seemed to get more done today than we usually do on a Saturday. The morning started overcast, but warm and so, as usual on a Saturday, we walked to the High Street, this time with Angela getting a newspaper and a few things for dinner in the Coop. Then it was home to start reading the paper before doing the weekly accounts. I found that the money I transferred from Dad's RCI Bank account into his current account had still not arrived, even after five o'clock.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria for the usual two and a half hours! Then Angela continued to work in the garden and I went into the garage. I fitted the new bolts that hold the float chambers on to the carburettor body, using some thread-lock around a couple of threads. The slow-running adjuster has always seemed rough to turn, but I can't see any way to lubricate it without removing the cable completely.</p>
        <p>The weather improved as the day progressed. There was hardly any wind, the sky gradually cleared of clouds and it was warm enough to have the patio door open until quite late in the evening.</p>
