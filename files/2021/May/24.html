        <h1>Monday 24th May</h1>
        <p>The plumber arrived later than we had expected. He had been to buy some bits. I spent most of the day creating the IET Sussex May newsletter. By the end of the day I had sent a test newsletter to Greg for review.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her church coffee morning and again got very wet on her way home. We had a lot of post. It included the return of documents from Coventry BS and details of the account. At the end of the day I transferred Â£10 into it as a test.</p>
        <p>At five I joined the Eurotherm discussion group on Zoom. Only four or five of us are planning to go on the walk on Thursday. After dinner I looked at the maps to see where we are going.</p>
