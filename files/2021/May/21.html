        <h1>Friday 21st May</h1>
        <p>It was very windy all day. The plumber arrived at about 8:30 and left at four, having cut the floor panels to size. He still has to fix them down and cover them with plywood sheets.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers and the Post Office at around ten. When she got back she decided to make a new holder for my set of Whitworth spanners. She had made it by the end of the day, but had got one of the measurements wrong so had to make some modifications so that I can get the spanners out.</p>
        <p>Since nothing arrived in the post from Shawbrook Bank, I phoned them to check that the two lots of Â£40K that I'd transferred to them had arrived. I'm now just waiting to hear from Coventry BS. Otherwise I printed off the documents for Sundays MG Spring Run, looked at the route, read and worked out what to buy for the slow-running adjustment on the TC.</p>
