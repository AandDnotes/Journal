        <h1>Tuesday 25th May</h1>
        <p>It seems to have been a busy day. The plumber was here just after 8:30 and we agreed how the cabinets in the cloakroom would be sited. Angela started by going to the High Street and I edited and submitted my newsletter following Greg's comments. I also added a note of Sunday's MG run to my 'outings' web page.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the time working in the front garden and before lunch I cleaned out the rear gutters. Later I did the same to the front gutters and cut the grass all round. I also checked the fuel link on the TC. The banjo bolts on the fuel supply lines seemed fine, but the hold-up bolt on the front and rear carburettors are leaking. I also noticed that the slow running cable goes through the wrong hole in the bulkhead and that the starter cable goes to a solenoid that is bolted to the bulkhead, rather than to the starter motor. It looks as though this is off a TD!</p>
