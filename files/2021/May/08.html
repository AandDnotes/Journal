        <h1>Saturday 8th May</h1>
        <p>It rained heavily during the early hours of the morning and was still raining when we got up. However, by the time that I'd put on my wellies, waterproof trousers and kagool, it had stopped raining! In fact the ground along the twittens was still quite hard when I walked down to the newsagents to get a paper. Then it was a quick update to the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Rowan (today was her 9th birthday) briefly before we spoke with Victoria. I also ordered a voucher for Austin's birthday and started adding some photos to Angela's page on our 'family' pages.</p>
        <p>My application to RCI returned, with the original documents and the two accounts. The documents were also returned by Shawbrook. I also checked that the money from Dad's NS&I bonds is now in his current account.</p>
