        <h1>Sunday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>A relatively quiet day. Angela went off to church for the first time for some time and I started by sending Ferheen details of where to find the video recordings. Then I tackled the monthly accounts. In fact I had only just finished them when Angela got home. The rest of the morning was spent reading Saturday's paper.</p>
        <p>There had been some showers of rain during the morning, so we didn't go out. After lunch I started reading Ayn Rand's book Anthem. Then we spoke with Paul. Rowan was busy writing something on the computer. She has another week's holiday as part of the Spring break.</p>
