        <h1>Thursday 27th May</h1>
        <p>An excellent day. The sun was shining when we got up and was still shining as we sat in the sitting room in the evening.</p>
        <p>I phoned Dad and then made my lunch and a flask of coffee. It was warm enough to go out in just a sweater, so I put my kagool in the rucksack and set off at 25 to 11, bound for the Bramber car park. I met up with Hamish McNaughton, Simon Windust, Simon Keeble, Dave Brennen and finally John Halliday and we set off on a six mile walk along the eastern bank of the river and then back along the Downs Link. We stopped for lunch shortly after joining the latter. Towards the end we cut across the water meadows and under the castle. I left them there and walked back up the 'cows field' and home.</p>
        <p>I got home at 2:45 and spent the rest of the afternoon recovering.</p>
