        <h1>Monday 17th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went out twice today as did I. Angela started with a church coffee morning and got very wet on her walk home. It was a day of heavy showers and she was caught in one walking home with Shiela and June. Then, after lunch, she went to a WI informal meeting in the Memorial Gardens. Luckily she didn't get wet this time.</p>
        <p>My first out was in the late afternoon when I went to the dentist for a checkup. Although I was early I went straight in and was out only seven minutes after my appointment. The dentist took x-rays of each side and put some fluoride around the roots of my teeth. I must not rinse after brushing them and can put a little toothpaste on the one sensitive area.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to a WSMGOC meeting at the Frankland Arms at Washington. Quite a few people (about 25) went. I was presented with the 'Enthusiast's Cup'. Otherwise it was just a natter night.</p>
