        <h1>Sunday 16th May</h1>
        <p>Angela managed to stay reasonably dry to and from church this morning in spite of the heavy showers. I spent the morning replying to our new Fellow and filling in the forms for Dad's savings account with Coventry BS.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke firstly to Victoria and then to Paul. Victoria, Austin and Juniper had been camping with the cubs and Austin seemed to have enjoyed the experience. Juniper was sulking! Rowan was busy on her computer.</p>
        <p>I also experimented more with the dual boot software on the old laptop.</p>
