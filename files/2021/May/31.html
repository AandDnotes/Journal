        <h1>Monday 31st May</h1>
        <p>Bank Holiday Monday. And for a change is was warm (hot) and sunny with barely a breeze. In fact it was the hottest day of the year so far. While many went to the beach or other outdoor locations, we stayed at home and worked in the garden or the garage.</p>
        <p>I had not expected to make any progress with Dad's savings, but I had hoped to move some money from our current account into an existing savings account. However, online access to Kent Reliance (the operators of the chosen account) was down all day! I did review Ramon's latest edits to the fuel cell video and replied to him and Gavin with a suggested description.</p>
        <p>Angela had started in the garden quite early and I moved into the garage after morning coffee. I removed the rear off-side wheel, cleaned and waxed under the wing and removed the brake drum to for leaks. Later in the afternoon I did the same for the front near-side wheel.</p>
        <p>One other little exercise was to photograph a number of purple flowers, put them into a collage using an online editor and post them, primarily for Juniper, who likes purple.</p>
