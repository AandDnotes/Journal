        <h1>Sunday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>A good, but tiring day. The sky was clear blue when we got up and was streaming through the window while we had breakfast. However, by the time we left at ten o'clock it was raining. Luckily the rain didn't last long and it was dry for the rest of the day apart from a short shower around midday.</p>
        <p>So this morning we took the TC to Ashington to meet the MGCC participants in the 'southern' Spring Run. The RainX seemed to work well on the windscreen, but the rain had stopped by the time we got to the Red Lion. We had coffee and a small slice of cake before setting off on a 30 mile run to Leonardslee Gardens. Another group started at Leatherhead, so there were 100 cars in total. We had a dedicated area to park at Leanardslee, where we arrived at midday.</p>
        <p>So we had lunch in the cafe and then walked around the gardens, leaving just before three. We had the top down and were home a little before four, having done a total of 51 miles. The car ran well, although there still seemed to be a smell of petrol at the end.</p>
        <p>After a cup of tea we spoke with Paul.</p>
