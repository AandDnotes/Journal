        <h1>Friday 7th May</h1>
        <p>The day started with a clear blue sky. Cloud came and went during the day and finished mainly clear, although the breeze picked up during the morning and was quite cool. Angela started with a walk down to the High Street to do a little grocery shopping and to go to the Post Office.</p>
        <p>We then went for a walk, starting by going across the 'cows' field, across Maudlin Lane and down to Annington Road. Then to the South Downs way, a cut through to the Downs Link and then up Maudlin Lane. We had intended going up the 'cows' field, but they had just let the cows and their calves out for the first time and the man 'guarding' the lower gate said they were a bit frisky. When we got to the top we saw them running around the field and into the barn. We were home just in time to get lunch, after an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I ordered an Amazon voucher for Rowan and Angela walked back down to the High Street to have her hair cut. I took her photo before and after and posted them.</p>
