        <h1>Tuesday 18th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street and then had to retrace her steps to find the mask that she had dropped. Meanwhile, I transferred another Â£40K of Dad's savings to his new OakNorth account. Later we checked the lights on the Panda, since failure of one could explain the warning light that appeared yesterday. One of the rear number plate lamps was not working, but later I removed it and it looked fine. So I put it back and it worked.</p>
        <p>I had a reply from the owner of TC4984, who is in Staffordshire and imported the car from New York.</p>
        <p>After lunch I attended an RCEA Zoom talk on the taking of the Pegasus bridge on D-Day. Although I new some of the story, it was interesting. After an early dinner I attended the IET talk on 5G networks in vehicular applications.</p>
