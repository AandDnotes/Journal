        <h1>Saturday 15th May</h1>
        <p>A wet start, but is brightened up later. However, it wasn't a very energetic day. We started with a walk down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the bank statement, while Angela worked in the garden. I also spent time trying to back up files on the old laptop, which eventually worked once I'd added myself specifically to the remote user names.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage. I adjusted the rear brakes and handbrake cables and greased the rear prop-shaft u/j before lowering the car to the ground. Luckily Angela brought the washing in before it started raining.</p>
