        <h1>Sunday 14th March</h1>
        <p>The only time that I went outside today was to explain to a landscaper what we want doing. He will phone with a price and only after I say I want him to proceed will he put it in writing.</p>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent investigating the use of a favicon and how to get them displayed on my web sites. It seemed to work for two sites, a third displayed the wrong icon and a fourth didn't work at all. Then one of those that worked did not change when I changed the favicon.</p>
        <p>This afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. Then, for the first time in years, we watched an episode of Top Gear. It was actually quite entertaining.</p>
