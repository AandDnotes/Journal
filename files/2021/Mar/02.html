        <h1>Tuesday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>The day started very misty. In fact, although the sun came out before lunch, there was still some mist around.</p>
        <p>I spoke with Alan this morning, to update him on the rise in Victoria Grand fees. We then also looked at the VG's Facebook page and found some of Dad's paintings. I also prepared an introduction slide for the evening talk, although Norman, who was the convenor, had already produced one.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk up to Bramber Castle. We were only out for an hour. We had an early dinner, since I was acting as backup for an IET talk. The speaker, a very senior person in BP, gave an interesting talk without using any slides.</p>
