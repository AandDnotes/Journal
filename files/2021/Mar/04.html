        <h1>Thursday 4th March</h1>
        <p>Grocery shopping day. Actually it was also the day that Angela had an appointment at Worthing Hospital for her ears to be checked. So, since we were a little early, I drove to Waitrose and Angela walked back to the hospital while I went into do the shop. By the time that I came out, Angela was back and waiting in the car. I got most things right, although I did buy coffee beans instead of ground coffee! By the time we got home it was almost lunch time.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I joined an IET talk by the Scottish Network on the hydrogen economy. It started with a presentation, but there were two speakers and it was more like a panel discussion. The talk was also interesting, because it looked at the whole energy generation, distribution and consumption system.</p>
