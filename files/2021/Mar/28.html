        <h1>Sunday 28th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela attended her Zoom church service, I put the transparent silicone on the shower tray. Later in the morning Juliet and Colin came to take a photo of me with the the 'Enthusiasts Cup', which they then took away to be engraved.</p>
        <p>After lunch I added to my 'anecdotes' web page and we spoke with Paul. We also spent some time looking for something to give to the grandchildren as an Easter present.</p>
