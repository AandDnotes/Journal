        <h1>Friday 19th March</h1>
        <p>It was sunny most of the day, even if a little breezy and cool. Angela started by going to the butchers while I dealt with a few IET email and then finished my newsletter. I sent a draft copy to Greg for review.</p>
        <p>At three o'clock we joined Uncle Mick's funeral service online. I had sent details to Jemima at Victoria Grand, so Dad was also able to join. I spoke to him afterwards and he seemed a little confused. Alan also phoned later. We discovered that Uncle Mick was seven years younger than Dad, not five years. He was just approaching his 90th birthday when he died. So I updated one of my 'family' web pages.</p>
