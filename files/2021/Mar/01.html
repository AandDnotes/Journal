        <h1>Monday 1st March</h1>
        <p>The first day of metrological spring, and, after a misty start, ti was another sunny day, with, perhaps just a little more breeze.</p>
        <p>We had an email from Victoria Grand saying the Dad's rent would be going up on April 1st, by 16%! So I spent quite a lot of the morning working out Dad's income and forecasting his cash flow over the next six years; when his savings will run out. We will probably need to top up his bank account a little more before his NS&I bond matures in May.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street to post Krista's birthday card and buy a few things from the Coop. Later I modified the walled garden design (hopefully for the last time) and updated the 'scope of work'. I then chalked the outline of the patio so that Angela could visualise it.</p>
        <p>Later still I attended the Eurotherm group discussion meeting. There was not actually much discussion.</p>
