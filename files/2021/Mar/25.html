        <h1>Thursday 25th March</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy morning, even if the results were not quite as I had hoped. I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's and then went off to Victoria Grand to return Dad's (cleaned) electric razor. I also took him a photo of Corfe Castle, along with a sketch that he could paint. Then it was back to Lyons Farm to wait for Angela to finish the shopping. We were quite early and were home by coffee time, so I gave Dad a call.</p>
        <p>In the mail was my invitation to apply for a new driving licence, which I did online. Then it was time to walk down to the Health Centre to have my blood pressure measured. I got part-way down the second twitten when I realised that I'd not picked up my mask, so it was a quick about turn and a fast walk to the health centre. Even though the nurse took my blood pressure three times, it was higher than she thought acceptable, so asked me to buy a monitor, measure my blood pressure morning and night for the next week and go back with the results. So I spent Â£25 on a blood pressure monitor, which seems quite easy to use.</p>
        <p>Later I finished my notes on the control technology that I encountered during my career.</p>
