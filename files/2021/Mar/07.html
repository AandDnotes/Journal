        <h1>Sunday 7th March</h1>
        <p>Another weather report! Cold, sunny, with light winds. So after lunch we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe. It was muddier than we had expected, but it was sunny and not too cold, even though the temperature remained at about six degrees.</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela attended her Zoom church service, I finished my computer basics 'how to'. I also read the SRFC newsletter that I had not received earlier. Peter Plank and Clive Upperton had each written several articles on planes they had built over lockdown. I also discovered that I started building my Tiger Moth five years ago! And that SMC an 'order and collect' service, even though the shop is closed. So I could get some CA and continue with the build.</p>
        <p>After returning from our walk we spoke with Paul (and a little with Rowan). Their week had been as exciting as ours.</p>
