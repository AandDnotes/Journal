        <h1>Thursday 11th March</h1>
        <p>Breezy, but quite mild, so we walked down through the 'cows field' and down the Downs Link. After a loop around by the river we walked back up the Downs Link and then up Maudlin Lane. It was only an hour and a quarter walk and we were back just in time to get lunch. The wind kept blowing right through the day.</p>
        <p>I spoke with Dad, who was in the middle of a quiz, and then did a little work on the software page of my RC site.</p>
