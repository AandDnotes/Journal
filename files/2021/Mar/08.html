        <h1>Monday 8th March</h1>
        <p>I started by emailing Victoria Grand to see if I could arrange a Zoom call with Dad. Also, my ISA application was approved, but I have to wait for information to arrive by post. However, we transferred Â£20K into Angela's new account.</p>
        <p>I spent some time working out the size of size of an antenna as used on my RC experimentation and had a brief look at the talk I had prepared. Later in the day I started adding to the 'antenna' page of my RC web pages.</p>
        <p>While Angela had a Zoom WI meeting I had a Zoom call with Dad. He looked well and was about to play dominoes with Jemima, who organised the call.</p>
        <p>After dinner it was time for another Zoom call, this time the WSMGOC AGM. Luckily they use the 'free' version and limit things to 40 minutes, but there were 25 participants, at least five of which had two people.</p>
