        <h1>Wednesday 3rd March</h1>
        <p>It was only Angela that had anything arranged for today. She had a Zoom session to practice some service that is arranged for later in the week. So I replied to a speaker on SMRs and then completed the monthly accounts and updated our shares dividend spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Later I opened an ISA account for Angela. It started raining before lunch, so there was no incentive to go out.</p>
