        <h1>Tuesday 16th March</h1>
        <p>A more energetic day. Angela started by walking to the High Street to get a few things and I spoke with Julie at Victoria Grand. I can take Dad some cash on Thursday and she will give me his watch to get a new battery. She will also ask him if he wants to view Uncle Mick's funeral service on Friday.</p>
        <p>Before lunch we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe, getting back just in time to make lunch. It was quite mild and with little wind, so I had to take my cagoule off half way round.</p>
        <p>Later I added some more to my notes on my career, but initially put things about my career in the page on control. So had to do some editing.</p>
