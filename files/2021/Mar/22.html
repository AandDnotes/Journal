        <h1>Monday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>After an early coffee we went out for a walk. It was quite mild and intermittently sunny, with only a light breeze, so we went up the upper horseshoe, down the steps to the lower horseshoe and home. It took us an hour and a half; back just in time to prepare lunch.</p>
        <p>Then Angela did some work in the garden, I transferred some money from Dad's account for the cash, watch battery and Christmas cards, and put some cash for Krista's birthday in Paul's account. I then read the final GOG document in preparation for tomorrow's meeting. It took several attempts to call Dad (no one answered), but when I spoke to him we had the patio door open, with Angela in the garden.</p>
