        <h1>Tuesday 9th March</h1>
        <p>The forecast said that today would be the last fine day for a while, so we tried to make the most of the sunshine from rise to set, the light westerly breeze and a mild temperature above ten degrees.</p>
        <p>Angela started by going to the High Street, twice. She forgot her mask the first time. Meanwhile I paid Dad's paper bill, replied to our Communications Officer about this week's web page update and read the 'blog' from our would-be author. It was good, but I just made one comment.</p>
        <p>After an early coffee we went for a walk around the field to the south of Mouse Lane. We were out for an hour and a half, but got home just in time for lunch. Then, rather than do our Dutch lesson after lunch we went outside. Angela gardened (not quite sure what) while I cut the grass, front and back, and washed the Panda. I swept the garage floor in between.</p>
        <p>So by the end of the day we were tired.</p>
