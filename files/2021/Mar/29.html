        <h1>Monday 29th March</h1>
        <p>Today was sunshine from dawn to dusk. Angela started by taking a package to the Post Office to send it to Rowan. It was a book and cost more to post it than to buy it. She then delivering some letters to her WI members and met lots of people, so was quite late back. In fact, I hung out the washing! Before lunch I started up the TC and drove it out of the garage, where I took a couple of photos. I had to turn the engine over a lot of times before it fired. But it started on first fire. The photos are ones that I am thinking of using in an article.</p>
        <p>Later I started making notes for the article. We also ordered Junior Monopoly for Austin and Juniper via Amazon US.</p>
        <p>Angela went out delivering letters again in the afternoon. Of course, she met lots of people again and so was very late back. I waited until five o'clock before making a pot of tea, forgetting that the Eurotherm group Zoom meeting started at five. Angela reminded me when she got home and so I was a little late joining.</p>
