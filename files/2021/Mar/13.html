        <h1>Saturday 13th March</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the High Street, where I bought a newspaper and some rolls. It was still windy, but at least it was dry. After reading some of the paper I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the statement.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spent two hours talking with Victoria. I also experimented with .icon images on web sites.</p>
