        <h1>Friday 26th March</h1>
        <p>I started the morning by measuring my blood pressure. After the nurse found that it was a little high, this morning's reading was slightly low.</p>
        <p>Somehow the morning seemed to disappear just dealing with odds and ends. However, after lunch I removed the silicone sealant from between the back wall and half the length of the shower tray in the bathroom. I then used some mould killer to clean it so that I can start reapplying sealant tomorrow. In between I reviewed and modified my notes on 'control' and uploaded the files to Github.</p>
