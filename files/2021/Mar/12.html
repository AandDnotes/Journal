        <h1>Friday 12th March</h1>
        <p>It seems to have been quite a busy day, but on the other hand we don't seem to have done very much. It was quite stormy overnight, but it was dry until mid-afternoon. Luckily it stopped just before Gary the landscaper called to look at what we want done in the gardens.</p>
        <p>Over and just after lunch I updated the OS on the iMac, which took longer than I had expected. Otherwise I finalised my write-up on the RC software and uploaded it to the RC web site.</p>
        <p>The only real work that I did was to remove the silicone sealant along both sides of the shower end panel. It was stuck well (too well) to the glass, but was not stuck to the shower tray. After scraping it off the glass with a blade I removed the remainder with some white spirit and then used some 'mould buster'. Tomorrow, when it has dried thoroughly, I will try to apply some more translucent silicone.</p>
