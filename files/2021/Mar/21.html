        <h1>Sunday 21st March</h1>
        <p>It was a day doing bits and pieces; a little of this and a little of that. While Angela attended the church Zoom service I put the spare slab at the end of the raised bed in the kitchen garden. A lump of concrete prevents the slab going down far enough and the slab does not go far enough back, so more work is needed. Then I read most of the Brighton GOG meeting documents before lunch, while Angela did some tidying int he garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Paul, Rowan was in the bath, until she needed her hair washed. In between these various activities we read the newspaper, although I did spend some time in the garage cleaning Dad's electric razor.</p>
