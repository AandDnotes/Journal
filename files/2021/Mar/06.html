        <h1>Saturday 6th March</h1>
        <p>A busier and sunnier day. They say that the British like talking abut the weather and I seem to mention it most days. It looks as though Spring is starting to appear, but it is cold. Luckily today there was little in the way of a wind.</p>
        <p>Angela went off fairly early to the High Street to get a newspaper, some rolls and a couple of other items, all from the Coop. I read/sent email and then did the weekly accounts. This was easy since we only had three Visa slips. So we then had an early coffee and went for a walk, across the cricket field, down and up the Rifle Range, then back down to Mouse Lane and back across the cricket field. We were back well before lunchtime.</p>
        <p>We had just finished lunch when Victoria called. It seems that Juniper is starting at her new school on Thursday. Presently they are divided into two, each group only attending for two days and a third every other week. The other days are home schooling. Kindergarden is only for half a day anyway.</p>
        <p>Austin will start at his new school in two weeks, when another child leaves. Until then he will continue with home schooling from his old school.</p>
        <p>I spent some time during the afternoon writing a 'how to' on basic computer operations.</p>
