        <h1>Thursday 18th March</h1>
        <p>We had a busy morning, even if it was very overcast. I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's, got some money out of the ATM and took it to Victoria Grand to give to Dad. After four rings of the bell I phoned them. It seems that the bell does work, but they were all busy. They checked the money, with a witness and then collected Dad's watch, which had stopped. I then took it to Timpsons for a new battery. I then went over to B&Q to buy some silicone sealant and an LED light to put over the computer desk. Angela was just putting the shopping in the car when I got back, so we then took the watch back to Victoria Grand. Unfortunately I didn't notice that the strap also needs replacing. One of the carers also gave me Dad's electric razors, saying that they were not cutting well. So I said I would clean his current (quite new) one and dispose of the other.</p>
        <p>We then called into Roger's Farm nursery so that Angela could get a small propagator and some plant plugs. She had bought some seed compost in Sainsbury's. We were home just in time to make some lunch. Afterwards I spoke with Dad and then did more of the newsletter.</p>
