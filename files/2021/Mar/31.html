        <h1>Wednesday 31st March</h1>
        <p>Angela joined her WI walking group early this morning, although they seemed to spend more time sat in someone's garden. I finished off my MG article and added another anecdote, adding the latter to the ROM site.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the health centre so that a nurse could check my blood pressure. I had been measuring it morning and night for the past week. She took the average value and measured it twice, both of which were lower than my measurements. So all seems to be well. However, she suggested that I measure my blood pressure perhaps once a week and had those results in to the surgery when I next go there for some other reason.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning I woke with a stiff back. I thought it was getting easier, but this evening is quite bad.</p>
