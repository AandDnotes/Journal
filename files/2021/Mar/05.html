        <h1>Friday 5th March</h1>
        <p>We didn't do a lot today apart from Zoom meetings. Although it was bright early and then later, it was mostly grey and cold all day.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela had a Zoom service and after dinner I had an SRFC AGM via Zoom. Otherwise, Angela did some washing and cooked. Whereas I finish my write-up on my micro:bit/pi project, added a page to my Notebook and started thinking about a 'basic computer operations' how-to.</p>
