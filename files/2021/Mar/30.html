        <h1>Tuesday 30th March</h1>
        <p>Apparently today was the warmest March day for something like 65 years! It was chilly to start, but was shirt-sleeves weather by lunchtime. It was sunny all day and is forecast to be similar tomorrow, but the temperature will be in single figures by the weekend.</p>
        <p>Angela had some WI letters to deliver, so we spent most of the morning walking around Steyning and Beeding. She went off again after lunch to deliver letters in the opposite direction, while I fixed a fuel leak on the TC and checked the brake fluid level. i also checked the tyres on both cars.</p>
        <p>Later I added some more text and photos to my draft article.</p>
