        <h1>Tuesday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the Post Office and into the garden, but I only got as far as the garage; and then only briefly, even though it was mainly sunny. So Angela repotted two large plants in the hall as well as doing a batch of washing, whereas I submitted my newsletter, got it rejected by a mistake made by Julie, and re-submitted it. I did, however, start another page in my 'reminiscences', as the start of a set of anecdotes. I also finally received the usb cable that had been 'delivered', but did not arrive and then was re-sent.</p>
        <p>After lunch I joined the Gift Oversight Group meeting on Teams. Later I had a call from Juliet saying that the WSMGOC committee had elected me 'enthusiast of the year', mainly due to my articles for Main Gear. She will call on Sunday to take a photo of me with the cup!</p>
