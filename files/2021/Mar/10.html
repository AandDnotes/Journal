        <h1>Wednesday 10th March</h1>
        <p>The forecast was right. By mid morning it was raining and continued for most of the day, with the wind strength building. So we stayed inside.</p>
        <p>I received a letter from Close Brothers, supposedly containing a verification code for online access. But there was no number. When I phoned, they said that there had been a problem and that a code would be emailed to me. It hasn't yet arrived, but we transferred Â£20K into the account and later I received an email confirmation.</p>
        <p>I also completed my write-up on antennae and started looking at how to write the page on software and re-read articles on DSSS. Then we ordered a compost bin; a hot one.</p>
