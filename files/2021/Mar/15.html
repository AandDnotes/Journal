        <h1>Monday 15th March</h1>
        <p>It seems to have been a busy day, but it's difficult to pinpoint what we have actually done. The 'hot bin' arrived mid morning and Angela spent some time in the garden trying to sort out the compost in the old bin in preparation for transferring some of it into the new bin. Meanwhile I voted for IET Council, etc. candidates.</p>
        <p>I spoke with Dad, who thought that someone had said they would get him a new watch; one that does not use a battery.</p>
        <p>I continued to experiment with flavicons, but didn't get things to work properly. In the afternoon Angela had a WI Zoom call and then I had a Eurotherm group call.</p>
