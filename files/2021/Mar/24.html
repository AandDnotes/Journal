        <h1>Wednesday 24th March</h1>
        <p>We've been quite busy today, although haven't really gone a great deal. It was sunny this morning and clouded over later, so Angela worked in the garden. She moved the old compost bin to the front garden and I cut the grass, not because it really needed it, but because Angela wants some grass cuttings to help start off her hot bin.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I spent some time in the garage. The idea was to work on the TC, but most of my time was spent cutting up the Hotbin box into manageable pieces. I had put the trickle charger on the TC's battery yesterday and so today I checked the plugs and points. I also replaced the numbers on the plug leads.</p>
