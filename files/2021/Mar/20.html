        <h1>Saturday 20th March</h1>
        <p>The vernal equinox, so from now on the days get longer than the nights (at least until June 21st). When we got up the sky was a clear blue, but by the time we went out it had clouded over, although there was little in the way of breeze.</p>
        <p>So we went for a walk to Hyde Square, going via the 'cows field', the river bank and the maze that is Beeding, then returning via the water meadows. We were out for nearly two hours, so when we got back there was only just time to do the weekly accounts and to place an order (via a text message) for work in the gardens with Gary. I left a message on the Lesley's phone, although he called later, having not picked up the message. Gary messaged later in the day, setting us up for mid May.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Austin and Juniper were playing outside with their neighbour's son. Austin starts at his new school on Monday.</p>
