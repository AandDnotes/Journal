        <h1>Wednesday 17th March</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day working on this month's newsletter. In fact I didn't do very much else except send a couple of email. One was replying to the RCEA about their thoughts to broaden the membership.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Angela worked hard as usual, doing some washing in the process.</p>
