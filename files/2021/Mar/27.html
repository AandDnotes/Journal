        <h1>Saturday 27th March</h1>
        <p>We took our usual walk to the High Street on a Saturday morning. Angela went in the Coop and I bought a newspaper. I did the weekly accounts while Angela put on more washing and then I put some white silicone sealant along the rear of the shower tray. Then we set up the new 'hot bin' composter before lunch.</p>
        <p>Soon it was time to talk with Victoria. They have had some electrical work done, adding lights and rearranging switches. They've also been getting estimates for upgrading their bathrooms. As often happens we spent two hours talking with her and only saw the children in the background.</p>
