        <h1>Wednesday 29th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela walked to see someone who had more cash for her 'coffee morning' I started looking at the actions from yesterday's meeting, including emailing the team about something we forgot to include. Then it was time to have a FaceTime call with Dad. He looked well and seemed quite bright.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went in the garage and measured the kingpins. The new ones are three thou oversize. Although, the nearside one is a snug, but light tap fit in the axle eye. However, the cotter pin needs four and a half turns of the big nut to let the pin engage with the kingpin. So I emailed Roger Furneaux to ask his advice.</p>
