        <h1>Monday 13th September</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going to the High Street (her 'exercise' group was not meeting) and I had a Teams call with Julie Hudson about bugs in the Adestra template that we use. She showed me how to do one thing, but the other was repeatable. Afterwards I emailed the IET member from General Dynamics and then Peter Cole about fitting new kingpins. After lunch I emailed Roger Ferneaux, asking for his prices.</p>
        <p>Later I finished the draft of my article on the South Downs Run. Meanwhile, Angela went to a WI committee meeting. After an early dinner I went to the Frankland Arms to the WSMGOC meeting.</p>
