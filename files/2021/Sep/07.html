        <h1>Tuesday 7th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went to a funeral and I managed to remove the condenser from the distributor baseplate. I believe that if you put a meter across the capacitor (on a resistance setting) the reading should drop and then return to open circuit. There was no movement at all. Rather than just buy a new condenser I decided to buy a new baseplate, with contact points and condenser, since modern condensers are a different size.</p>
        <p>Then I added the introduction to the joint events programme document, added a read me file and shared the folder with the events members of the PEI group. Later we took a walk down to the High Street to get a couple of things. Then I sent an email to Ron Durno.</p>
