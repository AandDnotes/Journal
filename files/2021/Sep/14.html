        <h1>Tuesday 14th September</h1>
        <p>It seems to have been a day spent in front of a screen. While Angela walked down to the High Street I attended the Gift Oversight Group meeting. Later, Marnie suggested that we have a meeting (in a coffee shop) to discuss her strategy.</p>
        <p>I emailed Roger Ferneaux about king pins, Norman about finding a new secretary and added the RCEA talks to the 'programme booklet'. I also reviewed and revised my article on the South Down Run.</p>
