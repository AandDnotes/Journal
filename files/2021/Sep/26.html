        <h1>Sunday 26th September</h1>
        <p>The morning was damp, but it brightened up during the morning and the afternoon was mainly sunny. However, this is forecast to be the last day 'summer'. It is due to be raining and colder tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church and I spent the morning switching between the eOS installation and my 'pong' program. I decided that the periodic 'beeps' were coming from the old laptop. I probably left it in sleep mode and the battery was running down. In fact it wouldn't start without being plugged in. There were lots of updates, but the app would start, but then stop. So I decided to install the latest version of eOS. I downloaded the disc image and unpacked it on to a USB stick. It took a while to find out why the installation was failing, but I finally got it done. I now need to sort out the boot options.</p>
        <p>I didn't get very far with the python program, but in between I also finished 'zapping' the weeds on the drive.</p>
