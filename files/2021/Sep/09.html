        <h1>Thursday 9th September</h1>
        <p>The man from Leaneys arrived earlier than expected, while I was still in my dressing gown. Luckily Angela was dressed. He started by demonstrating that the handle could be fitted to the existing shower door, but agreed to fit the new door. He discovered in the process that John had put sealant on the 'inside', which would prevent water from draining into the tray. So he removed that.</p>
        <p>At about twenty to twelve we set off for the Sealane cafe in Goring to meet up with Chris and Alan. It was still quite misty when we left, but was a little brighter when we arrived. They were just getting out of their car as we walked up. They had visited Dad and found him looking quite frail. We had a good lunch and a good chat. We left at about two and went to Sainsbury's, where Angela did the shop while I waited in the car.</p>
        <p>After dinner I chaired the PEI group meeting.</p>
