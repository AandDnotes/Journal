        <h1>Monday 6th September</h1>
        <p>A more relaxing day. I started by putting the the battery of the TC on charge and then dealt with email. I also phoned Dad. He has been prescribed some precautionary antibiotics in case he has a urinary infection. However, he is feeling well. Later I spoke with Alan, who plans to come down on Thursday. Meanwhile, Angela went to her 'exercise' group.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started investigating the problem with the TC while Angela cut the grass. The fuel pump pumped fuel into a jar, power is getting to the coil and the coil is producing sparks. I removed the contact points plate in the distributor since the condenser does not seem to be well held to the plate (which is the earth connection), but at the moment I can't see how to get the condenser off.</p>
        <p>After dinner I had a call with someone interested in joining our IET Sussex committee.</p>
