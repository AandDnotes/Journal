        <h1>Monday 27th September</h1>
        <p>It was an early start, since I was due to be in Bognor at ten o'clock. I actually arrived just a few minutes late and met Peter Cole. It was pouring with rain when we got up and during breakfast, but had stopped by the time I set off and then the sun came out and it was a gloriously sunny day, if somewhat breezy.</p>
        <p>After coffee we started on the stub axles. Peter had a piece to hold in the stock of his lathe so that, with the reamer in place of the chuck, he could keep it in line. I removed the old bushes from one stub axle and he then pushed in the new bushes using his press. Then he ran the reamer through both bushes. The kingpin was much too tight in the bushes, so he used an adjustable reamer to open the bushes up a couple of thou. We then did the same for the other stub axle.</p>
        <p>In between we looked at parts of his TC and talked TCs. Then we had some bread and cheese for lunch before I left. I had planned to call in to see Hamish, but just as I was leaving he texted to say that he was going out!</p>
        <p>Later I installed Synaptic on the eOS system and then Gparted, so that I could modify the partition labels and names.</p>
