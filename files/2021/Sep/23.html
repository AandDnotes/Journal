        <h1>Thursday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>This morning I did a lateral flow test and registered the results. Then I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's and went on to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. However, when I got there I was told that the rules had changed and I now needed to be tested there and wait half an hour in the car before I could go in. But they hadn't yet sent out the email telling people! I couldn't wait half an hour since I had to pick up Angela. So I found her in the aisles and we had a coffee before leaving.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning emailing and adding a couple of items to my calendar, while Angela did her Dutch lesson. After lunch she made cakes and collected the church keys for tomorrow (her coffee morning). After many tries, I finally managed to talk with Dad and then I changed and then went into the garage to clean up one of the brake backplates, ready for painting. Angela continued making, and icing, cakes.</p>
