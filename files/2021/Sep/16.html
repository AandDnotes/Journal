        <h1>Thursday 16th September</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm. Angela went into Sainsbury's to do the weekly groceries shop and I went down to Boots to get two prints of the photo of Austin and Juniper. I had created a cropped, portrait version. I then sat in the cafe, reading a newspaper, until Angela finished and we had a coffee before coming home.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning sorting out the tools and bits of car in the garage and put batteries on charge for the mower. After lunch Angela cut the grass and I removed the off-side wheel, brake drum, brake shoes and hub. The dished washer had been almost completely flattened!</p>
        <p>After dinner I had a Zoom call with an engineer at Mott MacDonald who is interested in joining the IET Sussex committee.</p>
