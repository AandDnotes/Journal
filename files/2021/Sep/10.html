        <h1>Friday 10th September</h1>
        <p>This morning I tried out the downstairs shower. It was fine, although it is quite cramped. Also, the drain is in an awkward position. Then I had a chat with a student at the University of Sussex who is interested in joining our IET Sussex committee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned Dad (having tried several times in the morning) then went into the garage, fitted the new distributor baseplate, set the points and refitted the plugs.</p>
