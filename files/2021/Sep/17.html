        <h1>Friday 17th September</h1>
        <p>We spent the morning at two garden centres, eventually buying bags of compost, three shrubs and several sets of bedding plants.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch I went in the garage and removed the off-side brake back plate and the stub axle. I found that the slot on the near-side king pin was five thou deeper than that on the off-side, explaining why the cotter pin pulled further through.</p>
        <p>I tried to re-dish the dished washer on the off-side hub using two old sockets, but didn't have a large enough socket for the outside.</p>
        <p>During the day I updated the OS on the MacBook and in the evening emailed someone at ESA about a talk.</p>
