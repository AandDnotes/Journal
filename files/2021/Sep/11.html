        <h1>Saturday 11th September</h1>
        <p>We were not very early this morning. So by the time that we had walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and I had done the weekly accounts (including a reconciliation against the statement) it was lunchtime.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started the TC. It took quite a few turns before any cylinders fired, but once going it seemed ok. So I took the car for a short circuit down Clays Hill, along the bypass and back through Steyning.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. The children were playing next door, so we didn't see them. Brandon is unhappy with the management at work, which is not unusual.</p>
