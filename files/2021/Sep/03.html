        <h1>Friday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>I've had four replies to my request for volunteers so far. So I replied to three of them, suggesting a Zoom call. I also replied to the fellow who has been posting notes on our Twitter account.</p>
        <p>I discovered that the car insurance certificates were copies of last year and so had the wrong dates on them. I phoned them and got the correct certificates sent. I also put the TC's battery on charge, but even by the end of the day it had not reached full charge!</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the SRFC meeting at Hillbarn golf club. There were some interesting models on display.</p>
