        <h1>Saturday 4th September</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we started with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few items of grocery. It was noticeably warmer, but still quite cloudy until the afternoon. Being the first Saturday of the month it was market day.</p>
        <p>On our return I checked the TC's battery. The voltage looked healthy and it started the engine easily. So I put it back on charge for the rest of the day. The weekly accounts did not take long, so I replied to our Twitter man and then added the currently scheduled Sussex events to my joint programme document.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke to Victoria. The heavy rain of last week had passed and it was now a warm, sunny day. Brandon had some friends from work round, for I don't know what, and the children were left to their own devices. Their games seem to be more suited to four-year-olds. And Juniper looked particularly fat.</p>
