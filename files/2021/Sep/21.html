        <h1>Tuesday 21st September</h1>
        <p>The Autumn equinox, although it didn't seem like it. Today, after some mist, was mainly sunny and quite warm.</p>
        <p>Angela started by taking her WI cash to the bank in Storrington; on the bus. I cleaned the front door bell push, so that it now rings, and fitted the two new smoke alarms. Then I carved out a piece of MDF and tried to re-dish the 'dished washer' from the off-side hub. It moved a bit, but the washer was stronger than the MDF, which started to squash.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA AGM and talk at Field Place. The talk was on 'oddities' in the City of London. The lady was quite an entertaining speaker.</p>
        <p>Later I had a call from Hamish about Ramon's need for a CEng application advisor.</p>
