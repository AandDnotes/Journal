        <h1>Sunday 19th September</h1>
        <p>After updating our weekly accounts I spent most of the day drafting the September issue of the IET Sussex newsletter. I decided to change the colour scheme for this season, which meant modifying many images. Finally I got a draft sent to Greg for review.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Paul. Rowan is going camping (in a lodge) with her school tomorrow for three days. She is very excited.</p>
