        <h1>Saturday 25th September</h1>
        <p>Not quite as busy a day as yesterday. However, it was notable in that we both had our flu jabs this morning. We walked to the High Street to buy a paper and went on to the health centre. We were able to just walk in and there was only a very small queue. So it only took us a few minutes.</p>
        <p>When we got home, I did the weekly accounts and printed maps for Monday and Angela did some cleaning. After lunch I painted the brake backplates before we had a chat with Paul. We normally talk to him on Sunday, but they will be out tomorrow. Then, as we were having dinner, we spoke with Victoria.</p>
