        <h1>Tuesday 28th September</h1>
        <p>I phoned the Octagon Club, NTG and Orca in Hampshire about brake linings. The Octagon Club and NTG did not really have any information about their linings. Orca supply semi-consolidated linings for older cars, but they cut them to fit the shoes and then rivet and bond them. This means that you have to get the shoes to them. So I ordered a set of shoes from NTG.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I touched up the paint on the stub axles and then looked at the fitting of the kingpins and cotters. The kingpins are very tight in the axles, the nearside cotter is loose and I couldn't get the offside cotter all the way through (although the old cotter would). I need to measure everything.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the IET Sussex committee meeting. Our two young potential volunteers joined, but the older person, who I hope might take on the deputy chair role, did not.</p>
