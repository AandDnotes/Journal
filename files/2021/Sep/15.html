        <h1>Wednesday 15th September</h1>
        <p>Whereas yesterday was spent mainly in front of a screen, today was spent mainly in the garage. I spent the morning removing the near-side front wheel hub. I found that the lining on one of the brake shoes is coming off, so I will need to reline, probably, all the shoes. Luckily I was able to get the castle nut undone. It wasn't as tight as I'd expected, so may not have retained the original torque. Then, with the help of an elastic band, I was able to pull off the hub by getting the claws of the puller under washers on three of the bolts.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I removed the stub axle. I then 'played' with assembling a tool to remove the old bushes. Meanwhile, the email just keep piling up.</p>
