        <h1>Friday 24th September</h1>
        <p>It was a busy day. We started by taking things down to the church for Angela's McMillan coffee morning. I then came home and transferred some of Dad's money and then went back to help. Actually, I spent more time drinking coffee, eating cake and chatting. It went well and Angela took more money than on every previous event.</p>
        <p>I helped clear up and then came home to make lunch so that I could have a Zoom call with someone from General Dynamics about getting his team involved with the IET.</p>
        <p>Then I removed the trap from the bathroom washbasin and cleaned it out. Actually it was the piece fitted to the washbasin that was blocked. Afterwards Angela cut the grass and I cleaned up the off-side brake backplate of the TC. So hopefully both are now ready for painting.</p>
