        <h1>Thursday 30th September</h1>
        <p>It looks as though today was the end of Summer. It is colder and a lot of rain is forecast.</p>
        <p>Angela did the weekly shop in the High Street, rather than using fuel to go to Lyons Farm. She then spent some time digging dandelions out of the front grass and clearing the slate edge by the drive. Meanwhile, I worked on the TC. I started by making a drawing of the cotter pin so as to estimate what thickness 'shim' would be needed. I then fitted the off-side stub axle, with the new kingpin. It took quite a while to file down the cotter pin to fit, but everything went well. I then started trying to make an addition to the near-side cotter from a piece of bolt. I have yet to see if my idea will work.</p>
        <p>After dinner I extracted my article on the South Downs Run and sent it to Roger.</p>
