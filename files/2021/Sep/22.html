        <h1>Wednesday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>I started by paying Dad's paper bill and transferring his cash to our account. Then I went in the garage and removed the linings from two of the brake shoes. The first simply pulled off, although the second needed the help of a large screwdriver and a cold chisel. A wire brush in the drill finished it off.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I removed the linings from the other two shoes.</p>
