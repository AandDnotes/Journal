        <h1>Saturday 18th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to the village this morning while I joined the IET's Community Volunteer Conference (CVC). It started with an address from Danielle George and included some light-hearted events, an outline of MS Teams and breakout groups. There wasn't really long enough for the discussions. It finished at 12:30.</p>
        <p>After lunch I walked down to the Post Office to buy two smoke detectors. We had discovered that ours were 'out of date' before we moved here, so need replacing. Then I checked that the slot in the new kingpins are not too deep and then transferred the money to Roger Furneaux's account. I also checked a few entries in our account.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria. We had a conversation with Austin about a computer game they were playing and then mainly listened to Victoria. Brandon had a slightly better week at work, but he is still not happy with his boss.</p>
