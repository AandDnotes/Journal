        <h1>Wednesday 8th September</h1>
        <p>I have just realised that I was due to meet (via Zoom) someone who is interested in volunteering for the IET at 6:30 this evening. And I completely forgot. So I have apologised and suggested another time.</p>
        <p>Angela went off just before 9:30 to join her walking group. After their walk they went to the White Horse for lunch. Then she went to the first table tennis session of the season.</p>
        <p>Just after Angela left, so David F-B arrived and we went off to Ashington to meet the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee, brownies and a lot of chat we set off on the route so as to arrive at Parham House just after midday. One of the members had a fuel leak on his TD, so we spent a while trying to fix it. Then it was lunch (lemonade, ploughman's, cake and coffee), followed by a walk around the gardens. David F-B dropped me home at 3:15.</p>
