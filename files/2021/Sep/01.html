        <h1>Wednesday 1st September</h1>
        <p>The first day of meteorological autumn, much like yesterday. For me it was a day mainly spent in front of a computer screen. While Angela went walking with her WI group, I produced my Adestra email to the Sussex members from the draft that I produced yesterday. Later it was approved and distributed. I also experimented further with a joint events programme.</p>
        <p>Most of the afternoon was spent doing the monthly accounts.</p>
