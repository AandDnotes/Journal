        <h1>Sunday 5th September</h1>
        <p>Quite a day. We were up at six and got to Whiteways by eight. The TC was running well. We helped marshal the arrivals until 10:30 and then set off on the run. Before we got to Steyning there were instances of the engine 'stuttering'. So we stopped for coffee at the Castle Inn and then I examined the car. There were no leaks from the carbs, but when the ignition was turned on the fuel pump kept clicking quickly, rather than slowing down. I hit the pump with the socket set handle and it started behaving. So we set off again. However, the problem recurred.</p>
        <p>I nursed the car as far as Hailsham (we had taken the diversion suggested by Fran to avoid the roadworks at Drusilas), where we stopped in a service area. Luckily there was an RAC man helping some other people. He tried various things, by which time the engine would not start at all!. Ordering a recovery vehicle was the only option. The RAC person on the phone said that someone would be with us within 90 minutes. However, they got one of their 'partners' to do the job and it was four hours before someone arrived (from Westbourne Motors). However, he was very good and left the car in the garage in almost exactly the position that it normally stands.</p>
        <p>So we had a late dinner. We were worn out when we left Whiteways, so we were exhausted by the evening.</p>
