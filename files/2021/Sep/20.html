        <h1>Monday 20th September</h1>
        <p>We both had a busy day. Angela went to her 'exercise' club in the morning and to a WI meeting in the afternoon. I went off for a walk with the 'Eurotherm group'. I walked to the meeting at Bramber and then we walked up the 'cows field' (which I had walked down), up Sopers Lane, around the upper horseshoe, along the High Street, over the bypass bridge, around the castle and back to the Castle Hotel for a drink. We stopped for lunch at the high point at the memorial and Martin gave me lift part-way home. So I got home at 4:20.</p>
