        <h1>Sunday 12th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church and I reviewed the documents for next week's Gift Oversight Group meeting. After lunch we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe. Then it was time to talk to Paul. We even got Rowan to tell us some of the things she had done at school.</p>
