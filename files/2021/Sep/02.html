        <h1>Thursday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>We started by both taking a lateral flow test and printing off the resultant email. Then we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He seemed well, although he may have lost some weight. I gave him £30 to add to the £20 that he had. I have another £20 of his in my wallet.</p>
        <p>From Victoria Grand we went to Waitrose for coffee. So it was quite late by the time that we got to Sainsbury's. I sat in the car while Angela did the shopping and we got home just before one o'clock.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela checked that the flooding in New York and New Jersey had not affected Victoria et al and I updated the Shares spreadsheet, checking on a couple of stocks that had not resulted in any dividends for the past year. They had made a loss! I then spoke with Alan before dinner.</p>
