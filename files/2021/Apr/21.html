        <h1>Wednesday 21st April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off fairly early to go walking with her WI friends. She got home just before lunch, having sat in someone's garden drinking coffee. While they were walking by the river they saw a seal, basking on the mud (the tide was out). I didn't go out. It was bright, rather than sunny, and much windier.</p>
        <p>My main job for the day was to draft this month's newsletter. It took me a little to clear other things, but I spent most of the day on it. I then got the Adestra system to send Greg a test copy for review. I also downloaded recordings of the last two talks, which will need trimming before uploading to our Youtube channel.</p>
