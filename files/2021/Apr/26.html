        <h1>Sunday 25th April</h1>
        <p>Although it started somewhat cloudy, the sky soon cleared and it was sunny for the rest of the day, even if breezy and cool.</p>
        <p>Before Angela attended her Zoom church service (half an hour later than usual) I ran the output of iMovie through Handbrake to reduce its size, then uploaded it to YouTube. Then while Angela used the study, I read the paper and finished reading the DLS book.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Rowan is staying with Greet and Wim at the holiday cabin they had hired on the coast. Tomorrow and Tuesday (King's Day) are holidays and Rowan is on holiday from school for two weeks. However, Krista and Paul are collecting her tomorrow.</p>
