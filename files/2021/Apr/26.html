        <h1>Monday 26th April</h1>
        <p>After dealing with some email I called Victoria Grand and spoke to Dad.</p>
        <p>Angela had an appointment for a hearing test just after lunch, so she ate early and then walked down to the Health Centre. I then drove over to Victoria Grand to collect two revised letters stating that Dad lives there. I also picked up his glasses, the lenses of which had fallen out. He sat in the dining room and we talked through the open window and the carer passed out the glasses. One side was bent, so I  gingerly bent them back, scrapped out the frames and the edges of the lenses, loosened the screws, pushed in the lenses and tightened the screws. I doubt that they will last long, but at least I didn't have to take them to the optician.</p>
