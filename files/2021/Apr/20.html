        <h1>Tuesday 20th April</h1>
        <p>Another sunny and warm day; and quite a busy one. Angela went to the Post Office to bank her WI cheques and then we took the TC to Camelia Botna. When we got there we had coffee, sitting in the sunshine, and then looked around the plant nursery. Finally we bout birthday cards for Rowan and Austin and some cardboard models that will probably be expensive to post.</p>
        <p>The TC ran well, although the tick-over was a bit fast. We were home just in time to prepare lunch, but later in the afternoon I adjusted the idle speed. I also found that some of the bolts on the carburettors had worked loose, again.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I joined the panel (as backup) for the the IET Sussex talk on game software development. The speaker spent a little too long on some parts, but he interacted with the audience through the 'chat' window.</p>
