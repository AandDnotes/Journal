        <h1>Friday 9th April</h1>
        <p>We both went out today. Firstly Angela walked down to the high Street to do some food shopping. I stayed home since she was expecting someone to deliver some WI booklets, but didn't know when. They called while she was out. So after coffee I went for a walk. I went westward around the lower horseshoe, taking almost an hour. My back coped well, but I told Martin that I would not join them for a walk (of seven miles) on Monday.</p>
        <p>At lunchtime it was announced that the Duke of Edinburgh had died. So radio and TV programmes were changed for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>Angela did some work in the front garden and I read more of the AC book. I also had an email from the 5G speaker's PA to say that they were not able to attend a 'live' event. So I emailed to say that we were using Zoom and later sent her a permission form for the speaker to sign if he agrees to us recoding the talk. I have someone else to contact about the content of the talk! I also finished the start slide for next Tuesday's talk (that is fully booked) and sent it to Bruce.</p>
