        <h1>Thursday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>We managed to get out fairly early this morning. I dropped Angela at Lyons Farm to do the supermarket shop and I drove on to Victoria Grand (in the Panda this time) to collect the signed LPA and some mail. I then drove back to Lyons Farm and sat listening to the radio until Angela came out. We were home in time for morning coffee.</p>
        <p>Greg had reviewed my draft newsletter and replied, so I finished and submitted it. Angela worked in the garden and later I clipped the bush at the bottom of the drive.</p>
