        <h1>Tuesday 6th April</h1>
        <p>A slightly more energetic day, if you can class a half-hour walk around the roads as energetic. It was mainly bright, with some sunny spells, but also with the occasional flurry of snow!</p>
        <p>I sent off the notes to the PEI group and replied to Shuvechchha about her blog post, having got some feedback from Ferheen. I also started reading the Agatha Cristy novel 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'. After seeing some of a programme yesterday evening on Cristy, and hearing a recommendation for this book, I found a pdf version online.</p>
