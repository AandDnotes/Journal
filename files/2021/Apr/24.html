        <h1>Saturday 24th April</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day, but a bit breezy. We started with a walk to the High Street to get a newspaper and some rolls. When we got home I did the weekly accounts and transferred money between Dad's accounts so that his rent can be paid. Then I edited the video recoding of the HVDC talk, managing to implement a picture-in-picture. The export, as usual, was four times the size of the original file!</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke to Victoria (for an hour and a half) and then did our Dutch lessons.</p>
