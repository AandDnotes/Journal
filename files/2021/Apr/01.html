        <h1>Thursday 1st April</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Still overcast and mild, but quite windy. I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's and then went on to Victoria Grand to deliver a small Easter gift to Dad. We were home by eleven. While I uploaded my 'anecdotes' web page and created a text file version of my latest article, Angela went to the butchers and to the bakers for hot-cross buns.</p>
        <p>While we were eating lunch we received a FaceTime call from Dad (set up by Jemima). He looked well and quite chirpy. I phoned Alan later to tell him.</p>
        <p>Angela had a Zoom meeting starting at seven and I had my PEI group meting at 7:30. So Angela was in the study and I was in the dining room.</p>
        <p>Although my back survived driving to Worthing, it deteriorated as the day went on.</p>
