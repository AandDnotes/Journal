        <h1>Saturday 17th April</h1>
        <p>It was pretty much sunshine from dawn till dusk, although not very warm, with a slight northerly breeze. Nevertheless we made our usual trip to the High Street to by a newspaper. Angela also bought a 'get well soon' card for Dick.</p>
        <p>As usual, I did the weekly accounts while Angela worked in the garden. I also put the batteries for the RC transmitter on charge so that I can have a practice. I can't find any paper manuals for the transmitter and receiver, so I found online copies and downloaded them.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria as usual on a Saturday, and then Angela went back into the garden while I read. I've started a Dorothy L. Sayer book involving Lord Peter Wimsey.</p>
        <p>This afternoon was the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, so part of the evening was spent watching a recording of the ceremony.</p>
