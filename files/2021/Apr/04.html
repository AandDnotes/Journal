        <h1>Sunday 4th April</h1>
        <p>Another fairly immobile day, although my back does seem a little easier. The day started grey, windy and quite cold, although it become sunny later in the day. I spent some time upgrading the Linux and Windows systems on the old laptop. The Windows update took a very long time, luckily I did not need to be sat at it.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, finishing in time to put a half-shoulder of lamb in the oven, before talking with Paul. It was a good meal, the first roast (apart from Christmas dinner) that we had cooked in our little house.</p>
        <p>After dinner we watched the Sky Arts broadcast of 'Jesus Chris Super Star'. Not quite what I had expected from an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.</p>
