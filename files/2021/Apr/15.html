        <h1>Thursday 15th April</h1>
        <p>We set off fairly early this morning. I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's and then off to the model shop to buy some cyanoacrylate, thin and medium. With that I can do some more to my Tiger Moth build. I then returned to Lyons Farm, filled the Panda with petrol, parked the car and walked down to Boots to get prints of the photo that Paul sent at Christmas. We were home just after eleven.</p>
        <p>My plan had been to tackle the fuel leak on the TC, but I seemed to run out of time. I sent off the IET forms for the remaining two talks for which I am convenor. I also sent a photo and some words to Roger, with a suggestion for an article in Main Gear. I also exchanged several email with Steve Priston.</p>
