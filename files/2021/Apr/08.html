        <h1>Thursday 8th April</h1>
        <p>No exercise at all today, even though my back is noticeably better. It started grey, but brightened up later. We replied to an email from Victoria about Bay's money that Angela had given her. It seems that she should have completed a tax form and now needs to catch up.</p>
        <p>Angela did more with her WI accounts and I generated an introduction slide for next week's IET talk and experimented with adding background music to a Keynote slide. It worked, but did not work with Powerpoint in Office 365. I also emailed Ferheen about her modification to the layout of the Sussex home page, hoping that she will tell me how she did it. I also read several chapters of the AC book.</p>
