        <h1>Monday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Angela's birthday. She went to a WI meeting in the park and gave blood! At least it was sunny, calm and not too cold.</p>
        <p>That happened after lunch, although, since I had a Zoom call at 5pm and then an IET committee meeting at seven, we had our main meal at lunchtime.</p>
