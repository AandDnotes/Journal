        <h1>Friday 30th April</h1>
        <p>Mum would have been 100 today. I expect that Dad has remembered the date, but perhaps not the significance.</p>
        <p>Angela went off this morning to the Post Office and then to help clean the church. I replied to my new speaker on 5G and then completed the Shawbrook Bank application form before it to the Post Office.</p>
        <p>After lunch I read another chapter of the AC book I've been reading and then had a short chat with Ferheen about editing and uploading recordings of talks. I then adder her to our YouTube managers list and sent her my notes on what I had done on previous videos.</p>
