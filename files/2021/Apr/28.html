        <h1>Wednesday 28th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI group this morning. Meanwhile, I attended a Zoom test session with my next speaker. Then I created the start slide for the talk. Angela got home just before lunch.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I downloaded the application form from Shawbrook Bank and started filling it in.</p>
