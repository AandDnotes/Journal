        <h1>Wednesday 7th April</h1>
        <p>Angela was off fairly early with her WI walking group. Meanwhile I walked down to the pharmacy to get my 'emergency' prescription of one month's bisoprolol fumarate until my repeat prescription is approved by the doctor.</p>
        <p>I had a call from Victoria Grand to ask if I had power of attorney for Dad. They would like a copy. I said that we had both financial and health LPA, but later found that we only had the financial one. So I printed it off and will drop it in when we are next that way.</p>
        <p>Angela did some more walking after lunch. She walked down to the High Street to buy some groceries. I did two Dutch lessons and then read some more of the AC book. Later I started preparing an introduction slide for the next IET Sussex talk.</p>
