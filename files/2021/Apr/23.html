        <h1>Friday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>This morning we walked down to the High Street. I took Dad's LPA  to the solicitor to get two certified copies. I was surprised that they only charged Â£10 per copy. They should be ready on Monday. Angela went to several shops, so I came home on my own. I also phoned Julie and Victoria Grand and asked her to provide two letters saying that Dad lived there.</p>
        <p>My newsletter was rejected, not because there was anything wrong, but because Julie wanted me to add a link to the Q*A file that she had uploaded to our web site. So I modified it and re-submitted it.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) lunch we went over to Victoria Grand to collect the letters and then parked in Grand Avenue and walked along the promenade to Sea Lane Cafe at Goring, before turning around and walking back. We were home by about 4:15. Angela then spent the rest of the afternoon cooking.</p>
