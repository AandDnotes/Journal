        <h1>Sunday 18th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela attended her Zoom church service, I read the newspaper and then read another chapter of the DLS book. Angela went into the garden. It was sunny for most of the day.</p>
        <p>Later I experimented with a blow-lamp and weeds on the drive, at least for on part of the drive. If the weeds die then it might be worth getting a torch on the end of a pole.</p>
        <p>Later still we spoke with Paul and Rowan. It was even sunnier there and they were sitting outside.</p>
