        <h1>Tuesday 27th April</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. I started by walking down to the solicitors in the High Street to collect the certified copies of Dad's LPA. I also bought some envelopes from the stationers. Then it was a case of putting the pack together to send to RCI bank. Angela also packaged the cardboard models for Austin and Juniper. After a cup of coffee we then went to the Post Office and paid as much as the cost of the models to send them. I also sent the documents to RCI bank.</p>
        <p>We then went off to one of Angela's WI members in Beeding to deliver a booklet. We got back home just in time to prepare lunch, feeling quite worn out.</p>
        <p>A little later we drove to Henfield, to the medical centre, to have our second Covid-19 vaccination. The rest of the time was spent dealing with email.</p>
