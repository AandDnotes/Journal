        <h1>Friday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>Good Friday, so we had hot-cross buns at breakfast. Angela had quite a busy and energetic day. It was a little overcast this morning, but the sky cleared after lunch and she went for a walk up Sopers Lane. Meanwhile I nursed my back, including trying Alan's remedy of lying on the floor. It seems to help.</p>
        <p>I uploaded my latest article to our web site. I can then point Roger to it as an example of how to lay it out in Main Gear. I also read Subu's latest blog post., although I still have to reply to her.</p>
