        <h1>Saturday 10th April</h1>
        <p>In spite of Angela having a painful knee, she joined me on a short walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Later in the afternoon her knee was feeling much better.</p>
        <p>I put the mower battery on charge before we went out so that I was able to cut the front and walled garden grass when we got back. Then, after coffee, and a quick charge, I was able to cut the kitchen garden grass just before it started raining.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria as usual on a Saturday.</p>
