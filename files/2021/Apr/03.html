        <h1>Saturday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>Today Angela did our walk to the High Street on her own, since my back was perhaps a little easier, but still stiff. So I stayed home and started the weekly and monthly accounts, which seemed to take most of the morning. It was cooler today and quite windy, but the sun came out later in the day.</p>
        <p>We normally talk with Victoria at about one o'clock, but she messaged to say that she needed to go out and so wanted to call later. Then she said that the children wanted to talk with us, so we spent an hour 'joining in' with their game. I then spent half an hour lying on my back on the floor.</p>
