        <h1>Friday 16th April</h1>
        <p>I spoke with Dad this morning, because he was playing games (drafts) yesterday afternoon when I tried to call him. Meanwhile, Angela went to the High Street to see if the produce shop (which is shutting down to be refitted) to see if they had any climbing plants that might be suitable for the garden. They only had clematis Montana.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I went into the garage to tighten up bolts on the carburettors to stop the fuel leaks. I also checked the plugs, which were sooty, and raised the jets two flats. Later I asked for advice on the mg-tabc forum, but they only suggested new washers and tighten the bolts enough!</p>
        <p>Later we went for a walk across the rifle range, getting back just in time to make a pot of tea.</p>
