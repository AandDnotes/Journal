        <h1>Thursday 29th April</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by dropping Angela at Sainsbury's and I went on to Victoria Grand to deliver Dad's electric razor. I found that a lens had come out of his glasses again! We were home by eleven.</p>
        <p>I'd put the mower battery on to charge before we went out, so I was able to cut the front grass before lunch. The back had to wait until after lunch and a recharge of the battery.</p>
        <p>I had an email from Vodafone to say that the speaker would not be able to do the talk in June. But they did suggest contacting someone else, so I did and before the end of the day he said yes. I also continued filling in the ShareBrook Bank LPA form and made copies of the documents that they want.</p>
