        <h1>Wednesday 14th April</h1>
        <p>Wahey! Or some such exclamation. The TC had its first run since November. After Angela went off with her WI walking group I took the jerry can to Beeding and bought 15 litres of Esso+. The TC had been difficult to start the last couple of times that I did so. I realised that the remaining three gallons in the tank was bought six months ago. So I put in 50 ml of additive and then put in the petrol. 15 litres in a jerry can is quite heavy, but I had a funnel, if only a small one.</p>
        <p>Then I drove the TC to Victoria Grand via Lancing and the sea front; then back via Washington; 26 miles in all. While at Victoria Grand I delivered a copy of the LPA and another copy for him to sign. Then I got him to look out of the window at the TC. I got home at midday, while Angela was sitting in someones garden drinking Prosecco. Admittedly this was after quite a long walk.</p>
        <p>Angela went out again after lunch to deliver some WI booklets to members, while I read so more of the AC novel and 'played' with the photos I'd taken of the TC at Victoria Grand. I also sent several email following a request from someone restoring a TA who is looking for an upholsterer and someone who can make a hood.</p>
