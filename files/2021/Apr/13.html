        <h1>Tuesday 13th April</h1>
        <p>My only venture outside today was to go into the garage to put the trickle charger on the TC's battery. On the other hand, Angela went to the High Street this morning and then delivered WI booklets this afternoon.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day trying to progress the investment of Dad's savings. I spoke to Julie at Victoria Grand about getting Dad to sign each page of a copy of the LPA. However, at least one bank will not accept a self-certified copy! I also left messages with two other banks to find out their requirements.</p>
        <p>We also had an email from TalkTalk about renewing our contract, so investigated alternatives before accepting the TalkTalk offer. It includes an Amazon Echo and SmartPlug.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended an IET Sussex talk on HVDC. It was not very good.</p>
