        <h1>Sunday 11th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela attended her Zoom church service I read more of another AC book and read parts of the paper. Then I did the weekly accounts, before looking at what I need to do with Dad's maturing NS&I bonds. I need to put some into an easy access account and then invest the rest in bonds that will mature progressively. NS&I rates are negligible, but using accounts with higher rates means spreading the money across five accounts.</p>
        <p>Angela did some work in the garden and later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
