        <h1>Monday 5th April</h1>
        <p>Easter Monday and not a very active day, mainly due to my back still giving problems, although I only had one lay down on the floor. Once again it was windy in the morning and turned sunny in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. They had been to see a bungalow of the type they have bought. Theirs is built up to the roof. They are now preparing (including isolation) for Dick's trip into hospital to have a hip replaced.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I drafted an email to the PEI group, recording the events of our meeting last Thursday.</p>
