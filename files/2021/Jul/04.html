        <h1>Sunday 4th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I started putting things back in the cloakroom. By lunchtime I had fixed the roll holder, mirror, towel ring and two hooks on the walls. After lunch I tried adjusting the cupboard doors, then Angela gave the room a clean and put back some plants.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul.</p>
