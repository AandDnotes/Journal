        <h1>Wednesday 21st July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off for a short walk in the heat with her WI walking group this morning. After dealing with email I spent a little time 'zapping' weeds on the drive. I also ordered a port adapter for the new MacBook Air and opted to move a maturing ISA account into another 2-year ISA.</p>
        <p>It was another hot and sunny day and the usual Dutch lesson took a lot of effort. Otherwise I made some bread, did some reading and 'played' with my 'pong' python program.</p>
