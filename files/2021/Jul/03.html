        <h1>Saturday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>After a short walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a read of some of the same while drinking coffee, I went into the garage to examine the TC. I'd put it on axle stands earlier and so looked at the steering box bolt and the off-side spring shackle. The bolt fixing the steering box to the chassis was tight (the mechanic at Simms had tightened it), although I wasn't sure how it could have been reached from below. Whilst there I tightened the bolt holding the drop arm to the sector shaft. Secondly I tightened the nuts on the pin that goes through the rear eye of the spring. I was still able to move the spring a little with a crowbar, but I can't really see a problem.</p>
        <p>However, whilst under the car I noticed that one of the three nuts holding the exhaust to the manifold was missing! The other two were slightly loose, so I tightened them. Later, after I had lowered the car to the ground, I found brass nut that would fit the stud and so put that on. The nut clearly fits the stud, but is smaller than the originals.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They are having a 'quiet' week with the children being away. They plan to meet Claudia in Ohio on Friday and travel home on Saturday. They will travel to Ohio on Wednesday so that they can meet Carol on Thursday.</p>
