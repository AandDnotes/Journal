        <h1>Monday 26th July</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went to s coffee morning at the church and I cleaned out the front gutter.</p>
        <p>After lunch we started removing the mahonia bush in the kitchen garden, putting the spiky leaves and stems in the brown bin (which had been emptied earlier).</p>
        <p>Before dinner I attended the Eurotherm group Zoom meeting. In between these things I tried to work out why my python 'case' code does not work. It still doesn't.</p>
