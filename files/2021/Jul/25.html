        <h1>Sunday 25th July</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up and rained (heavily) on and off throughout the day. Angela went off to church, in the rain, and came home in even more rain. Her feet got quite wet. Meanwhile, I continued setting up the new MacBook. I managed to get the MS Exchange set up so that I can view my IET email on the MacBook. However, for some reason the link was then broken on the iMac! I'm not sure how I did it, but I managed to eventually get it back. I also signed out of Dropbox on the old MacBook so that I could install it on the new computer. It seems that Dropbox only allows three devices (for the free version).</p>
        <p>Just before lunch I spoke with Alan. He and Chris had visited Dad! After lunch I 'wiped' the old MacBook, leaving it ready to be set up by the next user. I also found that there was a new version of OS and so upgraded it on the iMac. This happened while we talked with Paul. Rowan had been busy, but was too busy to tell us.</p>
