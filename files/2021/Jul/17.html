        <h1>Saturday 17th July</h1>
        <p>A hot, sunny day willed with not very much. I did another lateral flow test before breakfast (negative again) and then Angela walked to the High Street to buy newspaper and rolls. Meanwhile I read two articles in Totally T-Type 2. One was by Eric Worpe about replacing stub axle spindles. I might add a comment about him replacing those on TC4985. I was talking to Dad as Angela arrived home and Paul FaceTime'd. We had emailed to check that they were not affected by the floods and Krista had gone to visit Archie, so he gave us a call and we talked for a while.</p>
        <p>After coffee in the kitchen garden I helped Angela complete her WI gift aid claim, which took us until about ten past one. Just as we were finishing lunch so Victoria FaceTime'd. That call lasted until afternoon tea time!</p>
        <p>Finally I managed to get the weekly accounts done. That included a reconciliation against a bank statement.</p>
