        <h1>Sunday 18th July</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela went to church this morning and I checked the TC for fuel leaks. I couldn't find any, so perhaps the petrol smell was just exhaust fumes. I also started making notes on a blog post.</p>
        <p>After lunch I produced a drawing of my 'rectangular' design for the walled garden and updated the simple 'triangular' design that Angela still prefers. I also updated the scope and printed both.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we had a quick FaceTime call with Paul.</p>
