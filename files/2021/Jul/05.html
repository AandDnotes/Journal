        <h1>Monday 5th July</h1>
        <p>Angela had an appointment at the dentist at 9:30 this morning. I was still in the bathroom when she left, trying to cut my hair after showering. She was home just as I finished my exercises, so we had coffee and then went for a walk. It was breezy, but quite warm, if not sunny. We went up the upper horseshoe path and then on up to the South Downs Way. We followed that through the pig farm and then back through Annington and along Maudlin Lane. We got home at about 1:20 and certainly I was feeling very tired.</p>
        <p>After a later than usual lunch I returned to the monthly accounts. In the process I discovered that the RSA shares had been sold (RSA was bought by another insurance company), so about £3,200 had been added to the cash account. I transferred £3,000 to our current account. This means, of course, that our shares holding has been reduced. I did manage to finish the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>I tried to find the name or phone number of the person who gave us a quote for work in the gardens, but can only find the initials JE.</p>
