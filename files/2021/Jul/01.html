        <h1>Thursday 1st July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Tesco this morning to do the weekly supermarket shop. She didn't want to go over the Bostal in case there were still problems following the weekend's 'rave'. We later found from Felicity that the road was clear. I spent my time dealing with email, of which I seemed to have a lot. Before lunch I started 'zapping' weeds on the drive.</p>
        <p>After lunch I spoke with Dad during a break from lifting the TC on to axle stands. Initially I put the front on the adjustable stands with the pin in the third hole. However, I then couldn't get the jack (with wooden block) under the chassis at the rear. So I lowered the front to the second hole, but the trolley jack still would not go under the rear with the wooden block in place. So I rolled the jack under and then fitted the block. So eventually I got the TC up on the four axle stands.</p>
        <p>Rather than start examining the minor problems found by Simms I finished burning weeds on the drive before dinner.</p>
