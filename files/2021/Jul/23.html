        <h1>Friday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>We started by driving to Shoreham, to the recreation ground car park, and walked along the 'riverbank' past the house boats. Then across the footbridge into the town. It was the right time to stop for coffee, but I had forgotten my mask and so Angela was reluctant to stop anywhere. So we walked back to the car and came home.</p>
        <p>I received a statement for Dad's current account and found that NS&amp;I had returned the Â£675 that we had paid back! So I will wait for them to say something. Angela also had a check that she had paid into RBS (via the Post Office) returned, because it was made out to 'Angela James as executor' and they said that it is not an executor's account. All other monies associated with Bay's estate had been paid into that account! So Angela phoned Prudential and they will send her a new cheque.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I 'zapped' the remaining weeds on the drive. The hot, sunny weather is due to end today, so I wanted to get it done before the rain comes. Due to the weather forecast the barbecue on Sunday has been postponed.</p>
