        <h1>Thursday 15th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning to do the weekly grocery shop. I noted the details of our planned trip to Kew and printed our tickets. Then I went into the garage and started replacing the nuts that hold on the exhaust, although I only replaced one before lunch. So I did the other two in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Prior to doing so, we laid canes in the walled garden to help visualise my latest potential design. Angela is not convinced and made several detailed criticisms. Later I experimented with some 3-D 'garden' design software, that was actually a only capable of designing rooms.</p>
        <p>In the evening we watched 'The Importance of Being Ernest' on the TV.</p>
