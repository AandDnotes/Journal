        <h1>Friday 16th July</h1>
        <p>Angela decided that we could put a shed or store in the kitchen garden rather than in the walled garden. I'm sure that I suggested this at the start of our deliberations and the idea was rejected, but I think it is the best approach. So we spent a lot of the morning searching online for a suitable shed/store. It seems that the plastic 4'x2' Keter store is no longer produced, so we eventually found a wooden equivalent and ordered it. Delivery is on August 12th. In the mean time I can try lifting some of the old patio slabs and using them to form a base. We can then empty the old shed, ready for its disposal. I also played a little more with the online design tool, but it is not really capable of doing what we want.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I checked the tyre pressures on the TC and Panda and then took the TC for a run. I went through Bramber and Beeding, up through Henfield and then to Partridge Green, and finally back home via Ashurst, a total of 18 miles. As expected, the low fuel lamp cam on part way around. However, it was a fine day for a ride with the hood down.</p>
        <p>I tried calling Dad on several occasions, but the phone always went through to the answer machine after ringing for a while. I also tidied up another article for Main Gear and sent it to Roger.</p>
