        <h1>Thursday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>We overslept this morning, since we it was another warm night and we didn't sleep very well. Being Thursday it was supermarket shopping day. I went along (for the ride) so that I could have a little 'rummage' around B&amp;Q. I was looking for something to cover the black cables from the telephone point, but they only had a black spiral. I was also interested in a Riobi battery screwdriver, where the battery could also be used for the lawn mower. I was surprised to find a couple of alternatives. Meanwhile, Angela went into Sainsbury's, so after I had filled the Panda with petrol and browsed in B&amp;Q, she had almost finished. Unfortunately, the queues at the checkouts were quite long.</p>
        <p>When we got home we found a small package from Amazon. it was the port adapter for the new MacBook Air. Now I just need the computer. After lunch I searched again for a fuel leak on the TC, but without success. In the process I tightened the bolt on the 'plastic' horn and the lock nut on the off-side radiator stay.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I joined Mike and Dave for a Teams meeting to discuss the early talks for the next season.</p>
