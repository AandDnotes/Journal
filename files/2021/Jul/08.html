        <h1>Thursday 8th July</h1>
        <p>A tiring day. The alarm went off at 6:30 and I left home at 7:45 to head for Hurstpierpoint for the 'fan boats' STEM day. It didn't take as long as expected to get there, so I was early. We then had a good day talking to three classes and getting them to build and race their fan boats. I got home just after four, feeling very tired since I had given three talks, rather than the expected one.</p>
