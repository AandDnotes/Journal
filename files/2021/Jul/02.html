        <h1>Friday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>The day started quite misty, but warmed up as the day went on and we even saw the sun at times. The window cleaners came quite early. I asked them to clean the facia around the front dormer, which they did, but charged Â£10 to do so! I paid the money to NS&amp;I that had been paid in error into Dad's account. We then went off to Dunelm in Shoreham to change the toilet roll holder and light pull and buy some hooks and a a towel ring. It was nearly lunch time by the time we got home, but we had time to pay the plumber and electrician for the work on the cloakroom.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I did the weekly accounts.</p>
