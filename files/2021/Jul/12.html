        <h1>Monday 12th July</h1>
        <p>The day didn't really start well. The four STEM Ambassadors who went to St Lawrence Primary School last Thursday and Friday received an email to say that one of the children we were with on Friday had tested positive for Covid-19 this morning! So Angela went down to Steyning and collected some test kits from the pharmacy. She did not go to her coffee morning at the church, but came straight home. I did a test, which was negative. However, I decided not to go to the WSMGOC meeting in the evening. Angela phoned her WI committee organisers and they agreed that she should go to the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mike W decided to self-isolate (because it was easy to do so), Jack was already isolating since he had been 'ping'd' by the Covid app and Mike T tested himself and was negative.</p>
        <p>Of course, I could still attend the Eurotherm group Zoom meeting.</p>
