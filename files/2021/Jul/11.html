        <h1>Sunday 11th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I dealt with some IET email and started adding text to the final sheet of the Sussex Network budget spreadsheet for next year. I didn't really get very far before Angela was home. We had a slightly early lunch since the news was early today and, after watching the start of the men's final at Wimbledon, we spoke with Victoria. Their trip to collect the children had gone well, although they had changed their plans. Carol's mother had died suddenly, so they went on Friday and stayed overnight at Brandon's sisters house, where they met Claudia and Gene (and the children), returning on Saturday.</p>
        <p>After that we watched the rest of the Wimbledon final and I continued experimenting with my python code, with the aim of creating a game of 'pong'. The Euro 2020 football final started at eight, but we watched a concert from Vienna instead.</p>
