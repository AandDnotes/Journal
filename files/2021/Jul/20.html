        <h1>Tuesday 20th July</h1>
        <p>We spent all morning out walking, admittedly stopping for coffee and calling into the butcher and the supermarket. We went up the twitten, down through the 'cows filed', along the Downs Link to the river, back into Bramber and thought the water meadows to Kings Barn Lane. It was quite hot and we needed the coffee break in Cobblestone Walk.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela went to Springwells for a table tennis club afternoon tea. Just before she left, Lester Robinson called to look at what we wanted done in the gardens. He suggested a number of changes and will provide a quote in a couple of days. It will be much later in the year before he is able to start work.</p>
        <p>The other major event today was ordering a new MacBook Air.</p>
