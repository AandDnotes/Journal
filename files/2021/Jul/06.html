        <h1>Tuesday 6th July</h1>
        <p>A wet and windy day. Although Angela went to the Post Office, I didn't venture out of the door, other than to use the compost bin. It is, in fact, quite difficult to think what occupied the day.</p>
        <p>I am due to attend a STEM event on Friday, but today I was persuaded by Mike Wooldridge to join him on Thursday as well. Hamish should have attended on Thursday, but some positive cases within staff at the school, and the visit of someone who has been shielding at the weekend, persuaded him to pull out. So I spent some time looking at the schedule for the two days and made some notes to help.</p>
        <p>I downloaded the photos that I took yesterday, sent a couple of pigs to Rowan and Austin and posted another.</p>
