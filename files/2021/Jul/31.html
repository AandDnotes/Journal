        <h1>Saturday 31st July</h1>
        <p>It was sunny first thing this morning and so Angela went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls while I put sand on top of the ballast in the kitchen garden. I then managed to get the slabs laid and tamped down before coffee. This was lucky, since we then had showers and thunderstorms on and off for the rest of the day. Some of the rain was torrential.</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts before lunch and then did the monthly accounts after lunch. Later we spoke with Victoria.</p>
