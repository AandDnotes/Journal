        <h1>Monday 19th July</h1>
        <p>Another hot day during which Angela did quite a lot and I did very little. The milkman did not call this morning. He usually delivers our milk any time from midnight to five o'clock, but there was no milk when we got up. Luckily we had enough for breakfast. So then Angela spent 45 minutes on the the phone waiting for them to answer, only to find that there would be no delivery today due to 'a problem at the depot'. Consequently Angela went to the High Street to buy some milk.</p>
        <p>Before breakfast I did another lateral flow test, which was again negative, and afterwards we both showered. When I reported the result online I discovered that I had been reading the number 6 in the test device serial number as an 8. I could only distinguish them using a watch-maker's glass. So previous reports are likely to have been wrong, unless they don't use the number 8.</p>
        <p>One thing I did do was update the scope of work for landscaping and phoned Lester. He called back later to say he would try to call by tomorrow afternoon/early evening. Actually I did do something else; I finished drafting my blog post on self and identity. Otherwise I read some of the Octagon Club Bulletin, which arrived this morning.</p>
