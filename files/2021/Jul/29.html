        <h1>Thursday 29th July</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We started by both doing a lateral flow test and registering the result. We then set off for Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He seemed well, although he was wearing his old (very old) glasses. His new ones were in the draw. He thinks that he looks like Harold Lloyd when he has them on! We also found a box from Laura that had been delivered before Christmas. It still contained their unwrapped presents, so we got him to unwrap them. We also sorted out a couple of piles and put a lot in the bin.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we went to Waitrose for coffee and then to Lyons Farm, where Angela went into Sainsbury's and I went to B&amp;Q. I bought a new drill/screwdriver, three bags of ballast and a bag of sand. After lunch I emptied the ballast into my hole, but found that it was not enough. So I went back and bought four more bags of ballast and two bags of sand. On return I emptied the bags of ballast. I had done a rough sum and calculated that ten bags were needed. I've now put in eight bags of ballast and will use two or three bags of sand.</p>
