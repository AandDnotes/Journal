        <h1>Wednesday 28th July</h1>
        <p>We are both aching a little this evening. Angela went walking with her WI group (and had coffee at the Hub), while I removed the top-soil from the area of the base for the new garden store. I also put in pegs and string to get the level. The soil was distributed around the other beds in the kitchen garden.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon Angela worked in the garden, including cutting the grass and I took out some more soil, although it was much more sub-soil, which I put into two tubs. Hopefully we can dispose of it when the other work is done. I also emptied a bag of ballast, but will need to buy three more bags and some sand.</p>
        <p>The non-repeating keys in my python code was solved by upgrading python, which now supports the Apple M1 processor. However, I'm struggling with getting a button on a canvas without replacing the canvas.</p>
