        <h1>Saturday 24th July</h1>
        <p>This is the first journal entry made on my new MacBook Air. I wasn't expecting it to arrive until next week, but it came this afternoon. It was easy to move everything from the old MacBook using the migration assistant. But I still have a few wrinkles to sort out, like my IET email access and Dropbox (which can only be used on three devices). Certainly, the screen is noticeably better.</p>
        <p>There were thunder storms overnight, but it stayed dry and quite warm all day. The forecast is for more storms tonight and tomorrow. As usual on a Saturday we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper. I then did the weekly accounts, paid Dad's newspaper bill and moved money from our current account to one of Angela's Kent Reliance accounts. We had received money EQI when RSA was taken over, so we no longer have any shares in RSA.</p>
        <p>We spoke to Victoria in the evening. She is still having problems with Austin not wanting to write. It is the same problem. She gives in and Brandon doesn't get involved.</p>
