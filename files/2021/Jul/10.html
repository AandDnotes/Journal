        <h1>Saturday 10th July</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we set off to walk to the High Street, but it had more or less stopped by the time we got home. It was then fairly warm, very calm and dry, but cloudy for the rest of the day. I did the weekly accounts, which didn't take long, so quite a lot of time was spent reading the paper that we bought earlier. Angela bought a few things in the Coop.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul. They are going to a barbecue tomorrow, so we will only speak with Victoria. Although Angela did some pottering in the garden and did some cleaning, our main activity was to swap around the sofas.</p>
