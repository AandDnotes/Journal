        <h1>Friday 30th July</h1>
        <p>A lazy day, mainly due to the constant showers that prevented me from going out in the garden and working on the garden store base. Angela did walk down to the butchers, managing to miss the showers.</p>
        <p>I found that, even though it didn't say there was a problem, the iMac was not showing any IET email. So I spent a lot of the morning getting the MS Exchange server connected. It was working on the MacBook, but wouldn't connect to the iMac. I can't see how it is connected, but after removing the old MacBook from the list of iCloud connected devices, the iMac connected to the Exchange server. I then tested the ethernet port on the MacBook adapter by connecting directly to the raspberry pi.</p>
        <p>Angela spent quite a lot of the afternoon cooking. She made some 'chewy bars' as well as a casserole for dinner. Meanwhile, I answered a couple of email and then played with my 'pong' code. I managed to get the ball, instantiated from a class, to move by pressing a button.</p>
