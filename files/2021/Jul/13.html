        <h1>Tuesday 13th July</h1>
        <p>We were not particularly early this morning, but Angela went to the High Street and I dealt with email. We received some photos from the fan boat days, one of which will go into my September newsletter.</p>
        <p>I also did some research on a trip to Kew Gardens next month and listed the jobs to be done in the gardens. Later in the day I talked with Dad after several attempts to phone.</p>
