        <h1>Tuesday 27th July</h1>
        <p>Quite a productive day as far as the garden is concerned. This morning I managed to dig out the mahonia bush that we 'pruned' yesterday. All but the root went in the brown bin. Then Angela removed plants from the end part of the rear border in the kitchen garden, where the new garden store is going. To form a base we planned to reuse some of the slabs from the walled-garden patio. So after lunch I lifted six yellow slabs. They had been laid on a bed of something very hard, which was firmly affixed to the underside of a couple of the slabs. But a lump hammer and bolster chisel cleaned it off. We now have a slight variant on the checker-board patio.</p>
        Other than that, I continued playing with my 'pong' code. I managed to get a bat 'class' to work (even if I don't completely understand how), and so created two bats. My current problem is that some keys do not seem to repeat, that is, I only seem to get a single key press event when a key is held down.
