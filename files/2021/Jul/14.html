        <h1>Wednesday 14th July</h1>
        <p>The first of what is promised to be the first of some 'summer' days. I did quite a lot, although all of it didn't take me out of the study and the sitting room. Angela went walking with her WI group and I spent a lot of the morning reviewing the Gift Oversight Group documents.</p>
        <p>After lunch I booked out trip to Kew Gardens in August. I bought timed tickets for Kew Gardens, booked a room at the Travelodge across the river and train tickets to get there and back. I also produced yet another design for the walled garden. We decided that we would put a shed in the kitchen garden, so we have more flexibility for the walled garden.</p>
