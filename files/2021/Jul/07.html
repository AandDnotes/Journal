        <h1>Wednesday 7th July</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela was very busy. Before I was out of the bathroom she had left to go walking with he WI friends. She got back just as I was about to start preparing lunch. I spent part of the morning looking at the slides from the original fan boats workshop, which covered most of the day. Tomorrow and Friday the classes only have one and a half hours to design, construct and test their boats.</p>
        <p>I also went into the garage with the intent of replacing the other two nuts on the exhaust flange and putting spring washers under them all. While tightening the new brass nut that I had previously fitted, but with a washer, the thread on the nut stripped. I put another nut on without over-tightening it, but I am beginning to think that the 7/16" BSF nut has a thread similar to the 10mm stud, but not quite. So I might buy new nuts from the Octagon Club. As it happens, I couldn't find a way of getting the spanner firmly on to the other two nuts, even though I had tightened them yesterday. I could get a socket on, but then could not get the handle on so as to turn them.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop a day earlier than usual, since I will be using the Panda tomorrow. I did some more investigation on nuts, having measured the size of the exhaust flange studs, but didn't really come to any different conclusion. I also started experimenting with writing a python version of 'pong'.</p>
