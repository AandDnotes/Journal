        <h1>Sunday 20th June</h1>
        <p>A Sunday much like any other, except that I spent a lot of time painting. I started by editing my newsletter, following Greg's review, and submitting it. Then I checked over the Panda (tyre pressure, oil and water) in preparation for our outing on Tuesday. After that it was painting gloss on the woodwork. I still have the windowsill (I forgot to do it on my way round) and the main door. It looks as though I might need to give the woodwork a second coat of gloss, at least part of it, since the knots on the new skirting are still visible.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church and, since the sun came out for a while, then spent time in the garden. We also had a chat with Paul and Rowan.</p>
