        <h1>Tuesday 15th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went out to deliver WI things and go to the High Street I sanded down the filler in the cloakroom. Then I did a little more filling with some ready mixed stuff.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC to Simms in the village for a 'safety check'. Angela went out again and after getting a call from Simms I went to collect the car. The mechanic pointed out only three 'minor' items:
        <ul>
          <li>Play in rear bush of offside front spring (when levered with a crowbar). There was no play in the nearside spring bush. I replaced the bushes in September 2016. Might just need tightening the bolt that goes through the spring eye.</li>
          <li>Cotter pin on nearside kingpin looks odd, with washers on one side and the nut only partially on the bolt. When I had the stub axles replaced I used new cotter pins, but it was obvious that the nearside kingpin was not quite right. It was the right size, but the ‘flat’ is too deep. I already have new bushes and plan to replace the kingpins.</li>
          <li>The bolt holding the steering box to the bracket on the chassis was loose! The mechanic tightened it, but I need to check it.</li>
        </ul></p>
