        <h1>Sunday 13th June</h1>
        <p>A hot and sunny day, although the thermometer only reached about 22 degrees. Angela went to church and I removed parts of the wall plugs behind the radiator int he cloakroom and then washed down the ceiling and walls with sugar soap.</p>
        <p>Apart from talking with Paul during the afternoon, I mainly read the newspaper and Angela sorted out her WI accounts. We were just starting our main course (about 7:30) when the power went off. Luckily it came on again at five to seven, so we were able to watch the only TV programme that we wanted to see.</p>
