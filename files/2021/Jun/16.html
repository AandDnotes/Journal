        <h1>Wednesday 16th June</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went off walking with her WI group. I spoke to Sykes Cottages about our booking for the house on Anglesea in August, after quite a long wait on the phone. They started by saying that we could not get our deposit back since we had booked it from the UK. Then, since we had already changed the date once, they would not ask the owner if we could change it again. However, after some discussion they agreed to ask about a date change. They phoned back after half an our to say that the owner had agreed on a change of date and we set the new date for July 30th 2022. Unfortunately the price has gone up by Â£199, plus the booking fee. I paid the additional deposit on the credit card.</p>
        <p>Two letters arrived for Paul from Halifax. So I scanned one and sent it to Paul. Then it was back to the cloakroom, although I only managed to put some primer on the copper radiator pipes and sanded down the edge of the cupboard door (after taking it off).</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I joined the briefing for judges for the FLL event. MS Teams kept sending me codes, but would then not accept them. Then it worked without a code, so I was late joining.</p>
