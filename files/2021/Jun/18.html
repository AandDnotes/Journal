        <h1>Friday 18th June</h1>
        <p>A slight more productive day, albeit a lot wetter. After lunch I moved the rearranged drainpipe from Lynn's garage roof, which was still causing water to overflow our little flat roof.</p>
        <p>This morning I had a test Teams meeting with Estelle of Sussex STEM. The first time I clicked on the link it opened the app, asked me to enter my password and then a phone number, sent me a code and then would not recognise it! The next time I clicked on the link it joined me to the meeting! So we discussed how we could run the FLL robot game.</p>
        <p>After that I completed the June newsletter and got a test version sent to Greg. He was happy with it.</p>
        <p>Then I did some undercoating in the cloakroom. I didn't have time to paint the main door, but just took off the hardware. Meanwhile, Angela worked on her new cushion cover.</p>
