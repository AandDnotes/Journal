        <h1>Friday 4th June</h1>
        <p>Again the plumber arrived at 8:30 and Angela went off to help clean the church hall just after ten. I left a message on Tuesday's speaker's PA's answer phone, but didn't get a reply. Luckily I also left a message on the speaker's voice mail and he called back. He said that he had the link and would deal with form and bio this afternoon, but nothing has arrived. However, I'm now more confident that the talk will take place. I also wrote some notes on yesterday evening's meeting and sent them out.</p>
        <p>Angela came home for lunch and then returned to do more cleaning after some building work. I experimented with making a spreadsheet available to members of the PEI group as a means of sharing information about planned events. I also examined further possible garages for getting a safety check done on the TC.</p>
