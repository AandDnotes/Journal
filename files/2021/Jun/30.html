        <h1>Wednesday 30th June</h1>
        <p>The last day of June. It didn't really rain, just a few spots while we were sitting outside drinking tea, but it warmed up during the day.</p>
        <p>Angela went off walking this morning and I started my weekly application of lacquer on my toe nails. This may need to continue for nine to 12 months. Then Max Gargan arrived to discuss work in the gardens. He thought that the damp in the garage was probably due to condensation, since the soil outside is cold. He didn't think it worth doing; just live with it. He had a few other suggestions and thought we ought to replace the front wall. He will email an estimate. He has moved from Patching to Saltdean!</p>
        <p>I then spent the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon writing IET-related email; to Derek, Julie, Ferheen and to the whole committee. I ran out of time to do other things, since I had a call set up with Shanir for a 'lesson' on setting up a shared file in Office 365. It was successful and I then shared the spreadsheet with the rest of the PEI events contacts and mailed them to say what I had done.</p>
