        <h1>Monday 21st June</h1>
        <p>The summer solstice. Not that you would know it. Apparently it was the coldest summer solstice for forty years, And it rained for a lot of the day. We just hope that the weather is a little better tomorrow, when we meet Kate and Dick for a picnic.</p>
        <p>Angela went off for a coffee morning at the church, while I phoned Dad and then phoned NS&amp;I about their demand for a repayment of an alleged over-payment. It seems that the letter was legitimate and they will send more details. I did more sums and found that for the second year of the three-year bond they had used a slightly incorrect interest rate, but that only made an over-payment of £13, rather than the £600+ figure they stated.</p>
        <p>I then had a call from Julie, the manager at Victoria Grand. It seems that Dad has a urinary infection, but it seems that he has been going into a ladies bedroom (on the top floor) and has been found rubbing her back. They have asked him not to go into other rooms and wanted me to talk to him.</p>
        <p>Finally I got around to some painting, putting gloss on the windowsill and a second coat on the new skirting board and trim. After lunch I painted the door. I can't get a good finish with the water-based gloss. The cupboard door look terrible.</p>
        <p>I phoned Victoria Grand, but Dad was feeling unwell, so they suggested I phoned back after dinner, which I did. He was feeling a lot better and is on a course of antibiotics. I mentioned 'Mavis' and he said she had invited him in, but he has been told that he shouldn't go into her room. I then spoke to Alan to give him an update.</p>
