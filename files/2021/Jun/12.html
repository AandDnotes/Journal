        <h1>Saturday 12th June</h1>
        <p>Our 'daily' walk at the start of the first lockdown has morphed into a weekly walk, although Angela does go out on Wednesdays with her walking group. This 'weekly' walk seems to occur on Saturday, so this morning we went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls and then took a long way home. We went up Charlton street and across to the nature area, then into the fields and up to the top of the rifle range. We returned across the rifle range and down to the cricket field, then home.</p>
        <p>After updating the weekly accounts and reconciling them against the bank statement it was lunchtime. As we were drinking our coffee so Victoria called. Austin showed us his percussion instrument (a snare drum and a set of bells, which was a metallic xylophone) we spoke with Victoria. Angela then worked in the garden and I snipped a bush in the front garden. Then I put primer on the bare wood in the cloakroom and Angela washed the dining room and kitchen floor.</p>
