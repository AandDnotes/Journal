        <h1>Thursday 17th June</h1>
        <p>We seem to have been busy all day, but I, certainly, don't seem to have achieved a great deal. Angela went off to Sainsbury's this morning, while I did a little painting; only another coat of primer on the radiator pipes, cleaned up the edges of the cupboard door and started undercoating the wood. I also tried using the MS Teams app on the iMac. Again, MS sent me a code, but the app would not accept it. In the end MS refused to send any more codes, saying 'try again tomorrow'!</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I had a FaceTime call with Dad. He looked as though he hadn't shaved for a few days. Then I spent some time on the June newsletter. I need to finish it tomorrow.</p>
