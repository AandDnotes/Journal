        <h1>Tuesday 29th June</h1>
        <p>My day started sat in front of the computer listening to a talk by Jim Al-Khalili about his background and about being a 'scientist who communicates'. Interesting, but may not help with STEM activities. Angela went to the High Street and I started putting silicone sealant around the units and splash-backs in the cloakroom. After lunch I put translucent silicone around the base. Both were quite messy.</p>
        <p>As usual, Angela did some pottering in the garden.</p>
