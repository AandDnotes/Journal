        <h1>Thursday 10th June</h1>
        <p>We went off this morning, with Angela going into the supermarket and I filled the Panda with petrol and went to B&Q to buy paint for the cloakroom. I also bought a new door latch, which I fitted to the sitting room door later in the day. Before lunch I put a second coat of paint on one end of the hanging basket bracket. Meanwhile, Angela emptied the under-stairs cupboard and mopped the floor.</p>
        <p>Angela spent most of the afternoon in the garden. As well as fitting the door latch, I explored available shelving for the under-stairs cupboard.</p>
