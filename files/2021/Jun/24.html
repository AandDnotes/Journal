        <h1>Thursday 24th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went to do the weekly shop while I transferred money into Dad's current account, looked at the the FLL rules/missions and started painting the ceiling/walls of the cloakroom. I finished the latter by lunchtime, although Angela had to make the lunch.</p>
        <p>I 'played around' with my Scratch animation, found out how to record it, but Screenshot would not record the sound. So I recorded it on my phone, so it was a bit shaky.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I received invites to the FLL sessions tomorrow and replied to questions from Estelle.</p>
