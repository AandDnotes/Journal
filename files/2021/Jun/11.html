        <h1>Friday 11th June</h1>
        <p>The plan for today was to start decorating the cloakroom. But first we had to put everything back in the under-stairs cupboard. I started by driving over to Argos and buying a small plastic shelf unit, similar to the ones we have in the garage. So before lunch I assembled the shelves and put everything back in the cupboard.</p>
        <p>Later I sanded the new skirting board and areas of filler, then put some shellac on the knots in the skirting. Then I filled gaps around the wood with some decorator's caulk.</p>
        <p>Other little jobs were to order our parking disk for the coming year, re-fit the hanging basket bracket on the garage wall and to leave a message on the gardener's mobile asking him to tell us when he plans to start work.</p>
