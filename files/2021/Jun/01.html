        <h1>Tuesday 1st June</h1>
        <p>Today was my 73rd birthday! Although I only had two birthday cards. My special birthday treat was to take Dad to an appointment at the optician. I wheeled him down from Victoria Grand to Vision Express in Goring. Dad couldn't read any letters using just his left eye since the cataract had spread. Although the optician suggested just fixing his old glasses, they were beyond  repair, so he had to order some new frames and lenses. They also gave us a form to register to have the cataract removed. Dad is not keen on the idea, thinking that he will need to stay in hospital.</p>
        <p>I got him back to Victoria Grand at ten past twelve and got home just before one. The plumber had done all he could and had left, so after lunch we went to Mayberry garden centre. I was treated to a birthday cup of tea, but otherwise we only bought compost, hanging baskets and string.</p>
        <p>Alan phoned just after lunch to wish me happy birthday, so I told him about Dad. I can remember a birthday when we swam in the sea in North Wales and another when we had snow! Today our outside thermometer reached 25 degrees C.</p>
