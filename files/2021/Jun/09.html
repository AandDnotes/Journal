        <h1>Wednesday 9th June</h1>
        <p>Another busy day and another clear blue sky from sunrise to sunset. I started by send formal thanks to our speaker of the previous evening. Angela went off walking (and sitting in 'the Hub' garden drinking coffee) with her WI group, while I checked that money had been transferred from RCI Bank to our current account, renewed the car insurance and house insurance and finished cleaning up a hanging basket bracket and painted one end. I painted the other end later in the day in the hope that I can give it another coat tomorrow. I also took down a bird feeder bracket and fixed a new hanging basket bracket to the garden wall.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to M&S at Holmebush to collect a couple of items that Angela had ordered. We went on to Dunelm in Shoreham and bought new cushion innards, a door mat a toilet roll holder and light-pull for the cloakroom. We were home in time for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day I sent messages to a number of people who had joined the Sussex Network or were asking about CPD certificates for yesterday's talk.</p>
