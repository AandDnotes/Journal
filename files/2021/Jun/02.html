        <h1>Wednesday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>The plumber was here at 8:30, with his young helper. They had done as much as they could by one thirty and so left. Angela went walking with her WI group and I finished the monthly accounts. I also checked that the various money transfers had worked and updated the spreadsheet for Dad's finances.</p>
        <p>The morning was sunny, but it clouded over at lunchtime and there was even a few spots of rain. It then brightened up and was quite humid all day.</p>
        <p>Following yesterday's visit to the opticians, I phoned Julie at Victoria Grand to find  out Dad's doctor and his medication. Then I completed the 'cataract form' provided by the optician and emailed it back to them them.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I went into the garage, cleaned under the offside front wing and applied some wax, then removed the brake drum to check for leaks. I also checked the headlight alignment.</p>
