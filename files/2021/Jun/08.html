        <h1>Tuesday 8th June</h1>
        <p>A busy day. I started by taking the TC off to investigate people who might be able to perform a 'safety check'. I headed to Albourne, to a firm called Whites. They were on an industrial estate that seemed to be dominated by scrap metal merchants. They wanted to keep the car for two days! There was no way that I was going to leave the TC in that environment. So I tried to find the VW Camper Van restorer at Small Dole. After driving down several narrow lanes full of potholes I found the farm, but no sign of the company.</p>
        <p>When I got home, after a 24 mile trip, I phoned Simms, who were more than happy to look at the car. So they booked it in as an MoT, but will not register it as such. But they will only charge the MoT price.</p>
        <p>After lunch I found that the bolt holding the float chamber to the carburettor body on the front carburettor was leaking, in spite of it being a new bolt and using thread-lock. So I tightened it and will keep my fingers crossed.</p>
        <p>I also 'played' some more with my Scratch project. It now works, but I haven't yet found a way of recording it with sound. Someone arrived and took away all the rubbish from the cloakroom.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I joined (and hosted) the final IET talk of the season; on 5G. It seemed to go quite well.</p>
