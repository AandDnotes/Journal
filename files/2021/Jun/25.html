        <h1>Friday 25th June</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, without doing a lot. I started fairly early by joining an MS Teams meeting for the first session of this year's FIRST Lego League competition. In the end there were only three schools, so the first two were judged in parallel. Later in the morning all judges combined to view the third team. The awards meeting was finished by about 1:15. Teams worked without a problem.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers and did some housework. After lunch I started putting together a Notebook entry about using Scratch. I thought it might be a challenge for Austin and Rowan during wet days in the summer holiday.</p>
        <p>I spoke with Dad during the afternoon and the expected letter from NS&I arrived. The only extra detail was a date on which the over-payment had been made. It was further back than I had looked and, yes, they had made a payment of the stated amount. I tried phoning them, but no one answered the number given. We don't have a chequebook, so I need account details so as to return the money.</p>
