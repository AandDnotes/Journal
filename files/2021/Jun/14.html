        <h1>Monday 14th June</h1>
        <p>Angela started with a coffee morning at the church, while I signed up for both the South Downs Run and the WSMGOC barbecue. I paid for the former by bank transfer and took cash to the evening meeting for the latter. Then I started filling various parts of the walls in the cloakroom. I finished that after lunch, while Angela went to a WI committee meeting.</p>
        <p>At five it was the Eurotherm group Zoom meeting. then, after an early dinner, I took the TC to Washington to a WSMGOC meeting. There were a lot of MGs there, mainly Bs and TFs (the modern version). I left at about nine, before it got too dark to see. I think the carburettor is still leaking!</p>
