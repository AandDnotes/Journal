        <h1>Sunday 6th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I prepared the start slide and CPD certificate for Tuesday's talk. Nothing from my speaker, however. I also installed the latest Scratch editor and started looking at how to make a ball 'bounce'.</p>
        <p>After lunch I refitted the bolts that hold the fuel lines to the carburettors, with more thread lock this time. Then we spoke with Paul.</p>
