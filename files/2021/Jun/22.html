        <h1>Tuesday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>A good, but tiring day. We set off just after ten this morning to meet Kate and Dick for a picnic. We arrived at Langley Park at ten past twelve, having missed the final turn and gone around the block. We started by sharing a bottle of Proseco before having our picnic. Angela and Dick drank wine with their lunch whereas Kate (who was driving) and I had sparkling elderflower, followed with coffee in the cafe. Then we went for a walk around the park and finished with tea and cake. We got home just before 8:30.</p>
        <p>As far as we can remember, this was the first time that we had been on a motorway since we last met Kate and Dick at the same place!</p>
