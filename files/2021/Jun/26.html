        <h1>Saturday 26th June</h1>
        <p>We were not particularly early on our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. In fact, Truffles had sold out of the rolls that we like and so I had to buy white bread rolls. It was a fine morning and we had decided to go for a walk, but rather than go up the hills or down the river we went to a friend of Angela's in Bowmans Close to view their patio and get details of the landscaper who did it. It seems that he is a specialist in flint walls, but presumably there is not enough work in that line and so he does other hard landscaping.</p>
        <p>We were back by eleven, so after coffee and reading the paper I did the weekly accounts and Angela went in the garden. After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Claudia, Gene et al had left at five o'clock in the morning, in the hope that they could drive all the way in one day. Austin and Juniper went with them, so V&amp;B have a couple of weeks to themselves. Afterwards, Angela cleared out the shed! I looked through things for Monday's IET committee meeting.</p>
