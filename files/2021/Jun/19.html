        <h1>Saturday 19th June</h1>
        <p>A more productive day. Between us we:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Walked to the Beeding newsagents to buy a paper, returning via the river bank, the Downs Link and the 'cows field'.</li>
          <li>I did the weekly accounts.</li>
          <li>And checked that NS&I had paid what they stated and that those figures were correct. They say that they have paid too much into Dad's account.</li>
          <li>Angela removed bulbs from one of the big pots.</li>
          <li>I undercoated the inside of the cloakroom door and primed some bare plaster.</li>
          <li>We spoke with Victoria, quite late in the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The temperature only got up to 15 degrees and it rained a couple of times. Luckily we missed it.</p>
