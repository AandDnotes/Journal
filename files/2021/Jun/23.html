        <h1>Wednesday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going walking with her WI group. They went to see the pigs! I read through the FLL rules and missions and printed the score sheets. I also phoned Dad to see how he was. Luckily he seems to have 'completely' recovered from his urinary infection. Then I started painting around the edges of the ceiling and walls in the cloakroom.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the front grass and pruned most of the bay bush in the front. Once I had finished putting the first coat of emulsion around the edges I cut both rear lawns and cut the top of the bay bush, while Angela cooked dinner and some biscuits. As we were finishing dinner I got an email from Rowan, asking if she could spend some of her birthday voucher on Minecraft. Of course, we said yes.</p>
