        <h1>Monday 7th June</h1>
        <p>The plumber (and his mate) finished the cloakroom today; almost. The handle for the shower door does not line up with the holes in the glass door! So one or the other needs to be replaced. So they left at lunch time. We can now start painting.</p>
        <p>Angela spent the morning helping to clean the church hall and I added our IET Sussex talks to the PEI shared spreadsheet. Although Bronagh could access the test spreadsheet, Office 365 would then not let me share it with others! So I left a question with Julie. I then had a little play with my 'bouncing ball' Scratch project.</p>
        <p>After lunch the weed burner arrived. The handle wouldn't fit together, so I had to elongate a hole. But then I spent some time trying it out. After phoning Dad I then removed the rusting hanging basket bracket and started cleaning off the old covering.</p>
