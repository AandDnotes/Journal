        <h1>Saturday 5th June</h1>
        <p>We did quite a bit of walking today, well, comparatively speaking. I hadn't been out for a walk all week, so I didn't have to walk far to break my record for the week. We started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper, but took the long way home via the lower horseshoe. This meant that we were back just in time for coffee. We paid the flooring shop for laying the cloakroom floor and then Angela worked in the garden while I did the weekly accounts. I discovered that, having moved money from our current account into a savings account there is now not enough to pay both the house insurance and the cars insurance. So I will need to move some back.</p>
        <p>While out, the optician left a message to say that Dad's glasses were ready. So after lunch we drove to Victoria Grand, walked down to Goring and back and left his new glasses with one of the carers. On the way back we stopped at Morrisons for Angela to get some plants for the hanging baskets.</p>
        <p>Victoria had sent a message to ask if we could talk later in the day. Thus our decision to go our after lunch. So after dinner we spoke with her for just over an hour. A shorter stint than usual, but she didn't have much new to report and the children were outside running through the water sprinkler. After some wet and stormy weather is was hot, sunny, but humid. The children only have a week and a half of school before the summer break.</p>
