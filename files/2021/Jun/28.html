        <h1>Monday 28th June</h1>
        <p>We had so many things to do today that I had to make a separate list of jobs, otherwise I was bound to forget something. We had to get up early since we were expecting a British Gas technician to service the boiler, any time between 8am and 1pm. He arrived just after nine. From early on we heard more reports of the 'rave' that had taken place off the Bostal Road over the weekend and there were still 'odd' people wandering around. Apparently the Botal remained shut due to abandoned cars and a couple of accidents.</p>
        <p>Before he cam I checked Dad's current account and paid his newspaper bill. I also moved £50 into Victoria's account as a birthday present for Brandon. After a few conversations with people at NS&I I obtained the account details to do a bank transfer, but there was not enough money in Dad's account to do it straight away, so I set a transfer of £500 in process.</p>
        <p>Angela went to a church coffee morning, so I walked down with her to go to the pharmacy to collect my pills. I also bought some 'fungal nail' medication, which cost £18! I then spoke with Norman and we experimented with MS Teams so that he could send out invites for the evening's meeting. I also sent email reminders to the NPL and the SMR speaker. Then I emailed someone else about a talk on imaging technology.</p>
        <p>I spent quite a lot of time on Zoom or Teams. There was the Eurotherm group meeting later in the afternoon and after dinner we had our Sussex committee meeting. In amongst all these things I managed to tidy up the cloakroom and refit some of the hardware.</p>
