        <h1>Sunday 27th June</h1>
        <p>Another painting day, hopefully the last. While Angela went off to church I painted around the edges, just finishing before lunch, and then used the roller on the rest of the walls after lunch.</p>
        <p>It was dry, but not sunny, early in the morning. Then there were a couple of showers and the rain set in later. Later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul and Rowan, just before they watched the Netherlands play football (they lost).</p>
