        <h1>Thursday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>We were up early, but the flooring man didn't arrive until a little after ten. However, he was finished before lunch. There was only just enough Karndene in our box left over from the hall, kitchen, dining room. However, we now have a continuous floor.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly supermarket shop while I ordered a weed burner, replied to the FLL briefing email and downloaded the latest IET logos, sending them on to Ramon and Gavin.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC for a test run on my figure of eight course. The slow running adjustment seemed to work and the brakes pulled up straight. Angela cut the rear grass (both) and a little later I cut the front grass.</p>
        <p>In the evening I hosted a Zoom meeting of the PEI group.</p>
        <p>So overall quite a busy day.</p>
