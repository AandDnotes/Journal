        <h1>Wednesday 15th December</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning with the WI walking group. I put the MG's battery on charge, with a view to taking it to get get some petrol. Then I retrieved the Christmas decoration case from the loft. The mouse traps had not been tripped, although the smell in the airing cupboard seems to have gone.</p>
        <p>Apart from Angela walking to the Post Office to post the remaining Christmas cards, the rest of the day seemed to be one of reading, the newspaper and online. I also listened to the recording of the first Reith lecture on AI.</p>
