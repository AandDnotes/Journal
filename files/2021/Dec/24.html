        <h1>Friday 24th December 2021</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning installing the new outside light, which seems to work well. Angela went to the High Street to get the few things we couldn't find yesterday. Later I cleaned the plugs on the MG in preparation for Boxing Day. The third and fourth cylinder plugs were still a bit sooty, so I raised the rear carburettor jet by one more flat.</p>
        <p>I 'measured' the load on the Raspberry pi when serving a web page, using the 'top' command. The additional load seemed to be between 2% and 8%, depending upon the number of images. Later still we started the jigsaw that Victoria and Brandon sent Angela. We didn't get much further than the edges.</p>
