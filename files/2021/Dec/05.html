        <h1>Sunday 5th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I read and made notes on the GOG documents for Tuesday's meeting. Later I completed the 'declaration of interest' form and sent it to Melissa.</p>
        <p>For a few days I've been saying that I need to check over the cars. So after lunch I actual got around to it. I left the TC battery on charge, even though I'm unlikely to take it on the Sussex Wanderers run on Wednesday. I then started 'playing' with 'festive' borders for images in my December newsletter.</p>
        <p>Since it was Sinta Klaus day in the Netherlands today, we didn't speak to Paul et al until after dinner. Rowan was already in bed, but came down for a quick chat.</p>
