        <h1>Saturday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Day! Angela prepared some vegetables before going off to church. While she was out I prepared our starter, Brussel sprouts and 'pigs in blankets'. When she got home we did more of the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick and then at four we had a three-way talk with Victoria and Paul. At the end of that it was time to put the oven on. We had a good Christmas dinner.</p>
