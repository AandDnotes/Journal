        <h1>Monday 20th December</h1>
        <p>My December newsletter was approved and launched this morning and towards the end of the day I compiled the list of questions for our speaker on SMRs. I also completed the online radio survey that I had been recording fro the past week.</p>
        <p>At 11:30 we set off to meet Chris and Alan at the Sea Lane cafe, before they went off to visit Dad. We had a good lunch and a chat, even though we were both very cold, sat out in their marquee. We were home by 2:30, having stopped to buy potatoes and fish for dinner.</p>
