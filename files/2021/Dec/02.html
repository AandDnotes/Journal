        <h1>Thursday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>Either one or moth of us usually go to do the weekly groceries shop in the morning on Thursdays. However, today we had arranged to visit Dad, arriving at Victoria Grand at two o'clock for our lateral flow tests. So in the morning we Angela did did washing and her Dutch lessons, while I started dealing with things for the talk on Tuesday of next week.</p>
        <p>While we were with Dad we compiled his Christmas card list and got him to sign some cards. We were also able to connect the iPad to their wifi and show Dad some photos.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we did the weekly groceries shop and filled the car with fuel (which was the most expensive we have ever bought), missing out on our afternoon tea until we got home at about five.</p>
