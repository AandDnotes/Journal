        <h1>Tuesday 14th December</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went to catch the bus to Storrington to bank the cash from yesterday's WI meeting. She was back before long, since the bus did not show. So we took the car to Storrington, had coffee, banked the cash and bought some more Christmas cards. I had started writing up the notes from Thursday's PEI meeting before we left, so finished and sent them before getting lunch.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to go to the RCEA talk, which was very good; given by a Dutchman on electric vehicles. When I got home I phoned Dad and booked an appointment to visit him on Thursday at 3:30, since they are restricting the number of people allowed in at any one time.</p>
