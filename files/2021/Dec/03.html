        <h1>Friday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>For some reason we were a little later than usual getting up. I spent most of the morning preparing an introduction slide and the bio notes for Tuesday's talk. Angela went to the High Street to post a card to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Later I read the latest Flypaper before going to the SRFC Christmas meeting.</p>
