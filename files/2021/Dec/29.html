        <h1>Wednesday 29th December</h1>
        <p>A lazier day, at least for me. Angela went to the butchers and the library, so she did go out. However, a lot of the day was spent finishing the jigsaw puzzle, after which I posted a photo of it on our shared album. We also caught up on some TV.</p>
