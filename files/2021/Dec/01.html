        <h1>Wednesday 1st November</h1>
        <p>I started by telling the IET Sussex committee members about our new Secretary and Deputy Chair. Then it was back to trying to resurrect my Raspberry pi. It took a while to find the firewall configuration file and edit it. Then I could ssh and vnc to it again. However, accessing the server using an ip address did not work. It looks as though the external ip address provided by TalkTalk includes a port number. So I might not be able to do what I want. Meanwhile, Angela went to her table tennis club.</p>
        <p>After dinner we walked down to the High Street for the Christmas fair. I bought some chestnut and raffle tickets. People have started putting up Christmas lights.</p>
