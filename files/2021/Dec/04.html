        <h1>Saturday 4th December</h1>
        <p>This morning, in addition to a newspaper, we bought some rolls and a 'new home' card for Laura. It was market day, so our walk home started by going through the market. After reading a little of the paper, I did the weekly accounts and made a start on the monthly accounts, finishing them later in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, after she had finished her walk with neighbours. We also spoke a little with Austin. He showed us his Hot Wheels Advent calendar (and Junipers Play Dough calendar). He also explained how he had missed his band practice and what social science classes he has at school.</p>
        <p>Victoria then described the conversations that she had with his teacher and the school's psychologist. Everyone agrees that something is stopping Austin from wanting to write, but no one seems to have a suggestion as to what.</p>
