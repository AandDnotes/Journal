        <h1>Thursday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Angela went to the butchers to collect the turkey (rolled breast) and I investigated the outside light that doesn't work. I couldn't get the bulb out and couldn't undo the connector. So we decided to buy a new unit.</p>
        <p>We had an early lunch and then went to Victoria Grand. The traffic was heavy, we had to sit in the car while our tests developed, then they lost Angela's test and she had to do it again!. Nevertheless we were able to hold FaceTime calls with Victoria and then with Paul. Dad was well and tried on the joggers that we had bought. Luckily they were fine and just need turning up.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop. I went to B&amp;Q and bought an outside light.</p>
