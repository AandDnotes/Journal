        <h1>Thursday 30th December</h1>
        <p>After an early lunch we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. We still have to sit in the car while our lateral flow test 'develops', but we got to his room at about 2:15 and stayed for an hour. We then went on to Sainsbury's for a cup of tea before Angela did the grocery shopping while I filled the Panda with petrol and went to B&amp;Q. I bought two more LED outside lights (their last two like the other that I bought, which were on 'clearance') and a pice of MDF from which I hope to cut a pice to fit under Dad's chair cushion so as to make it less saggy. I also started researching how to search text files and discovered that some of the files I copied to the Raspberry pi were out of date!</p>
