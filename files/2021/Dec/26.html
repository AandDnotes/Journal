        <h1>Sunday 26th December</h1>
        <p>Boxing Day! That meant that we left home at 10:15 and headed to Adversane to meet up with other WSMGOC members for the Boxing Day run. It had rained heavily over night and first thing, so we took the Panda. In fact, we all had to turn around at one point because a river had flooded over a bridge and we all decided that it was too deep for the MGBs that were on the run. We had a good Italian meal and got home at about 3:30.</p>
        <p>The evening was spent watching the TV and doing the jigsaw.</p>
