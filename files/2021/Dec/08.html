        <h1>Wednesday 8th December</h1>
        <p>Luckily, yesterday's storm had passed and it was mainly sunny and dry, with only a brisk breeze. So I took the TC to Ashington to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. Since we were meeting at the Red Lion for coffee and then returning there for lunch, I left the TC in the car park and we went off in David F-B's modern TF. I took the main roads to Ashington, which were dry, but at least one of the roads on our route had water right across. That one turned out to be closed for some BT cable work. So we had to go back through the water.</p>
        <p>Lunch was a traditional turkey one, followed by Christmas pudding. I got home at 3:30, half an hour before Angela, who had been to table tennis.</p>
        <p>We found a dead mouse in the airing cupboard! I had heard noises in the loft, but haven't yet got around to checking it.</p>
