        <h1>Tuesday 21st December</h1>
        <p>Today was the shortest day. So you could say that summer is on its way.</p>
        <p>We had no outings planned for today, although Angela did go down to the High Street to get some rolls. So the day was one of doing a number of small jobs, some on the computer, some reading and one outside. The latter was to glue the fixing back on the number one of our house number with some epoxy and then fitting it back on the front wall. I also sent the list of questions to the SMR speaker.</p>
        <p>I booked a visit to Dad and then spoke with him. He didn't remember that Chris and Alan had visited him yesterday, although he did remember that they had left a Christmas present that he had put in the cupboard.</p>
