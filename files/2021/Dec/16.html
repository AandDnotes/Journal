        <h1>Thursday 16th December</h1>
        <p>I repaired the frame of Dad's painting while Angela went to the High Street. Then I edited the recording of last week's IET talk and sent a couple of email.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) lunch we went off to do the weekly shop. We had some difficulty getting out of Steyning, since we wanted to go down the main road, rather than over the top, but Clays Hill was still closed. Our route took us via Berriedale Drive so as to deliver a couple of Christmas cards. Dad's old house didn't look much different, apart from a new front door and pot plant around the steps.</p>
        <p>We went to Waitrose, since we didn't have much to buy, and then went on to Victoria Grand. After our lateral flow test we went up to see Dad. He looked well, although he struggled to get up out of his chair. I had repaired one of his paintings, so we hung that back on the wall and put up his Christmas cards. We also measured his waist and showed him photos of jogging trousers to see if he would like to try some.</p>
