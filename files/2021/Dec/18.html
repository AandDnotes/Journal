        <h1>Saturday 18th December</h1>
        <p>We took our usual walk to the High Street. I bought a newspaper, some rolls and batteries for the Christmas lights, while Angela went to the butchers. Afterwards we took the MG to Beeding to get petrol. Angela walked back, delivering cards on the way. I put the TC in the garage forwards, to see if that makes it easier to get in and out.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria et al. They were rather preoccupied with their farming simulator game. Afterwards, I ordered Amazon gift cards for each of them, using some of the money on Angela's Travel Money Card.</p>
