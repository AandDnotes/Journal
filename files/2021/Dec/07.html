        <h1>Tuesday 7th December</h1>
        <p>There was a bad weather warning for today, so Angela went down to the High Street before the wind got up. I spoke to Dad. He was still in bed at 10:30, but said he would get up. I also removed the battery charger from the TC. Luckily Angela got home just before it started raining.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I attended the Gift Oversight Group meeting (on Teams). Luckily it was a fairly short one. So then I sent out a reminder email to the PEI group.</p>
        <p>After converting some absolute links to relative ones I updated some of my website. Then, after an early dinner, I was convenor for an IET talk on the manufacture of Small Modular Reactors. I was an interesting talk, with a good attendance.</p>
