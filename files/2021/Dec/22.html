        <h1>Wednesday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>It was another 'indoors' day for me, although Angela was out early with the WI walking group. So I 'played' with my web server. Actually, I signed up for a free domain name so that I could test access to my server on the Raspberry pi. The domain name only lasts for 30 days (although it could be renewed), but at least I was able to test it. Later I started to document what I have done.</p>
        <p>Angela went for another walk to deliver Christmas cards. In the evening I watched the last episode of Outlaws. I've been watching one each evening.</p>
