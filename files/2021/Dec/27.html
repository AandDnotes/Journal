        <h1>Monday 27th December</h1>
        <p>It rained for most of the day, so we didn't go out. I repeatedly tired to phone Dad, but the line to Victoria Grand seemed to be unavailable all day.</p>
        <p>We did quite a bit of the jigsaw, I sent a few email, spent some time looking for a YouTube video and completed a draft of my web page on setting up a web server on the Raspberry pi. Angela turned up Dad's new joggers and put his name in them.</p>
