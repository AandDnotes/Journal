        <h1>Friday 31st December</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day. Not that it really made any difference. Angela went to the High Street to buy a birthday card for Olly and then went down again to post it. Unfortunately, an inconsiderate driver splashed her on her way home.</p>
        <p>I started thinking about a 'gallery' web site and discovered that I had messed up my Projects site. It took some time to rectify. However, I also started putting together a 2021 page for Year Notes section.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was an evening in front of the TV.</p>
