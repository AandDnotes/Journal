        <h1>Thursday 9th December</h1>
        <p>I discovered this morning that the new IET communities web sites were active. So while Angela went off to do the weekly groceries shop, I uploaded the programme booklet and set up a blog page for CPD certificates.</p>
        <p>I covered the MG and investigated the airing cupboard and the loft looking for evidence of mice. I didn't find anything, although there was still a smell in the airing cupboard. Angela bought a couple of stick-on hooks, so I put one on the hall radiator to hold the front-door key.</p>
        <p>I continued putting together some notes and images for this month's newsletter. I also did a little preparation for the PEI meeting scheduled for this evening.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the PEI group call. We had a couple of apologies, but only Bronagh (and later Joe) joined.</p>
