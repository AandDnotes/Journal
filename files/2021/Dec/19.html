        <h1>Sunday 19th December</h1>
        <p>Angela has been out twice today, this morning to help get the church ready and then this afternoon for a carol service. I updated the 'programme booklet' and later sent it to the PEI group, since I can't update the blog page.</p>
        <p>After lunch (when we had our main meal) we spoke to Paul and Rowan before Angela went out. In the Netherlands they are now on a full lockdown.</p>
