        <h1>Friday 10th December</h1>
        <p>Today was a day of two parts. I spent some time this morning and some later in the afternoon working on the December newsletter. There is still a lot to do. The other part of the day was doing Dad's Christmas cards. Angela went to the High Street and posted, not only Dad's cards and other that she had written, but also those going overseas.</p>
        <p>Although there was a chilly wind, the sun shone for most of the day. This was handy, since Angela made two trips to the High Street, having forgotten her mask on the first trip. However, the washed towels did not dry particularly well.</p>
