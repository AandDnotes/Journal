        <h1>Monday 13th December</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier than usual and both took a lateral flow test before Angela went to help set up the lunch club. She then went on to the WI 'Christmas tea'. I printed my Christmas letters and wrote their accompanying cards. Then I updated the December newsletter from comments from Greg.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I joined the Eurotherm call, before going to the WSMGOC Christmas meeting.</p>
