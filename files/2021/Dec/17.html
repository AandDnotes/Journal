        <h1>Friday 17th December</h1>
        <p>We decided to go to M&S at Holmbush to look for jogging trousers for Dad. It took us about 15 minutes to get out of Steyning. There was a queue in Castle Lane, so we turned around and went through Shooting Field to get to the bypass. We couldn't find what we wanted in M&S, but found some in Next.</p>
        <p>Angela went out to deliver some Christmas cards and I put up some lights, on the tree, around the front window, around the slit window next to the front door and across the shelves. Later, Angela hung baubles on the tree. I uploaded the talk recording to the IET Sussex YouTube channel and found that I could no longer edit my IET blog pages. So I sent them an email and also emailed one of our PEI group about the 'programme booklet'.</p>
