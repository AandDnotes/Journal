        <h1>Tuesday 28th December</h1>
        <p>A slightly more energetic day. It was windy, so we decided to go for a walk along the seashore. It started raining as we left home and we hoped it would still be fine in Shoreham, but it wasn't. So instead of walking to Lancing we decided to walk by the houseboats and over the footbridge. Unfortunately, all the cafes in Shoreham were closed, so we drove to Holmebush and had coffee in M&amp;S. We looked at shirts, bought some food and Angela bought a cardigan. We were home in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>Afterwards it was more jigsaw and more work on my web server write-up.</p>
