        <h1>Saturday 11th December</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Luckily it was dry and bright until the evening. We started by walking to the High Street. Angela went to the butchers to pick up the turkey for the lunch club and I bought a newspaper. We then went to the church kitchen to start cooking the turkey. Angela stayed there and I walked home to work on my newsletter. She got home just in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we went down and used the electric slicer to cut up the rolled turkey breast, getting home just before four o'clock. I then finished my newsletter and after dinner we spoke with Victoria.</p>
