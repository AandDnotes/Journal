        <h1>Friday 8th January</h1>
        <p>The temperature may have got above freezing today, but only just. This morning we went for a walk in the sunshine. We went up the twitten, along Goring Road, down Holland Road, and across Fletchers Croft to the library, where Angela wanted to return a book. We then walked along Kings Barn Road and into the water meadows, where we turned right rather than heading to the river and walked back through Clays Field.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I did another three walled garden designs. That is nine in total!</p>
        <p>We were expecting a landscaper to call to give us a quotation for replacing the kitchen garden fence. But he didn't show!</p>
