        <h1>Saturday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>Today we got back to some sort of normal routine. We headed down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. While I bought those, Angela queued at the Post Office to post a card. It was very cold and overcast, but calm.</p>
        <p>After a while reading the paper I updated the weekly accounts and, after lunch, the monthly accounts. Between the two we spoke with Victoria. They have paid the deposit on the house they are trying to buy.</p>
        <p>Just as I was finishing the monthly accounts I had a bit of a scare. It started with a slight chest pain that I felt was an indigestion-type pain. But then I felt sick and yawned a lot. I started sweating, but felt cold. Then my sight went blurred. According to Angela I looked very white. This lasted for about 20 minutes, I recovered after sitting in my armchair for a while.</p>
        <p>Just before dinner I felt much better and prepared the starter; then enjoyed a splendid steak pie that Angela had cooked.</p>
