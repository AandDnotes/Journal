        <h1>Thursday 14th January</h1>
        <p>A mainly wet day. Angela worked hard again. She drove to the supermarket this morning and later made a batch of biscuits and a complicated vegetarian (almost) cottage pie. We had some bacon that needed using, so that went in. It was probably the tastiest part.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day setting up regular savings accounts for us both and adding standing orders. Also checking other NS&I bonds that are about to mature.</p>
        <p>This evening we heard from the landscaping man that he has to finish off some other work and so won't be here until Monday.</p>
