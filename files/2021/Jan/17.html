        <h1>Sunday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Although we were late getting up this morning we showered so that we can be ready earlier in the morning, when we the garden man is expected to arrive.</p>
        <p>While Angela joined her Zoom church meeting I read the paper. Later I started producing a more manageable spreadsheet to record a monthly view of our finances. By the end of the day I had finished it, although I discovered that I do need to check some of the accounts, since I have not updated them for quite a while.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. I also had a call from Dave Posner (from France) about a couple of the planned talks.</p>
