        <h1>Monday 25th January</h1>
        <p>It was a day of doing a bit of this and a bit of that. A bit of preparation for the IET committee meeting, a bit of looking at Dad's finances and a bit of reading about tkinter.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to Beeding to look at the snowdrops in St Peter's. However, they were only just starting to come into bloom. But it was a sunny day and we were out for an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>After dinner I chaired the IET Sussex Network committee meeting. We had to restart Zoom twice!</p>
