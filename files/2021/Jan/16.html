        <h1>Saturday 16th January</h1>
        <p>Being Saturday we took our usual walk down to the High Street. Today, however, it was very wet and quite windy. I bought the newspaper and rolls, while Angela went to the Produce Shop to get some Seville oranges.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was spent dealing with finances; the weekly accounts and changing the dates of the standing orders for the regular savings accounts. The latter resulted from reading the letters that arrived from the Coventry Building Society. In spite of the problems with Royal Mail, these letters arrived less than two days after I had created the accounts.</p>
        <p>Quite a lot of the afternoon was then spent talking with Victoria. Their house purchase seems to be going well. They have agreed a reduction in the price due to work that needs doing and completion is set for the end of the month. However, she is still having problems with Austin's school work, or rather the lack of it.</p>
        <p>After dinner I watched the lecture on the Apollo Guidance Computer, which was excellent, and then the video of the descent.</p>
