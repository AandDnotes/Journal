        <h1>Saturday 30th January</h1>
        <p>Since we had a token from the Coop for a newspaper, Angela decided that I didn't need to go to the High Street this morning, since she could get everything in the Coop. So while she went out (there were a few spots of rain) I checked my video recording of the last talk and uploaded it to YouTube. I also embedded a link on our Network's web site.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning it was a case of updating the usual weekly accounts. Although the last NS&I bond has been closed and the money put into our current account, the transaction date is the 1st February! Perhaps the bank doesn't tag anything with a weekend date, but I was unsure if I should try moving the money to our new Skipton BS bond. So I decided to leave it until Monday.</p>
        <p>We were still eating lunch when Juniper called. The iPad was upstairs, charging, so I took the call on my phone. It seems that everything had gone to plan yesterday and Brandon had already gone off with a car full of stuff (mainly his brewing kit) to the new house. They also had tradespeople lined up to do the structural work and the electrics. They plan to move stuff over the next two weeks and have booked two men and a van to move the furniture. However, they've still not heard from their landlord.</p>
        <p>Later I started generating a 'how to find passwords' page. In the process I discovered that you can get a screenshot of the iPad by pressing the top button and the home button at the same time. The images are put into Photos.</p>
