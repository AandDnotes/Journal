        <h1>Monday 11th January</h1>
        <p>The main event of the day was arranging for someone to replace the fence in the kitchen garden. I phoned him this morning, he called as I was making coffee after lunch, he texted a quotation, which we accepted and he will do the work on Friday.</p>
        <p>I paid Dad's newspaper bill and then spoke with him. He thinks that his neighbour has COVID-19, but he is well. Angela then had a WI committee meeting via Zoom. Meanwhile, I added  notes on making a an online bank payment to my 'how to' page on online banking.</p>
        <p>Although it was warmer today (six or seven degrees), but we didn't go out in the garden to play with the canes. Something for tomorrow.</p>
