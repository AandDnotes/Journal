        <h1>Monday 4th January</h1>
        <p>This evening, England entered another national lockdown, at least until the February half-term. This means that everyone must work from home if they can and schools are to teach remotely. Neither of these restrictions will bother us much.</p>
        <p>My experimentation with micro:bit communications made some progress, but there is still more to do.</p>
        <p>This afternoon was a Eurotherm group Zoom meeting for 40 minutes.</p>
