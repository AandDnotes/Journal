        <h1>Sunday 10th January</h1>
        <p>It just about rose above freezing today. According to our outdoor thermometer it got to one degree celsius and the ice on the garden table (which has been upside down since the storm) did melt. So we stayed in, only popping our head outside to put things in the compost bin.</p>
        <p>Angela had her Zoom church service and I updated my garden design with the circular lawn. I then printed that and Angela's preferred option. Tomorrow, when it is forecast to be warmer, we will move the canes around in the garden.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday we spoke to Paul. He hadn't been out either. Krista's grandma has not gone down with any Covid symptoms after her neighbour caught it.</p>
        <p>I added some text and photos to my ROM page on my industrial control career.</p>
