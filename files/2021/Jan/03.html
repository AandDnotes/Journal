        <h1>Sunday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>A day of not doing a great deal. My only trip outside was to tighten the ropes holding up the fence post. It was too cold to stay out any longer. Angela attended her Zoom church service and I finished the monthly accounts and back-ups.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul, but spent the evening watching the TV, although I did a little more experimentation on communication between the micro:bit and MacBook.</p>
