        <h1>Friday 29th January</h1>
        <p>The morning was wet, again. With a little prompting, Julie uploaded the recording of the last talk. I then discovered that the sound was missing from one of the videos, so emailed Ramon, but received a copy of the video (embedded in a PowerPoint slide). So I spent quite a lot of time editing the recording. By the end of the day I had a 1080p video that was smaller than the original (I had removed some of it).</p>
        <p>After lunch and after it had dried up, Angela went to the butchers. In between all this I had a call from Paul Jones at Leaneys. He is sorting out another bespoke shower door and we decided what what colour units and worktop we want.</p>
