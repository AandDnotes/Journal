        <h1>Monday 18th January</h1>
        <p>We were prepared for the fence man to arrive at 8:30. Just our guess. He texted at about nine to say that he was on his way to pick up the wood and would be here by ten. He arrived at about 10:30 since he had to wait for mortices to be cut in the posts. Anyway, he finished just before it got dark at about 4:15. The new fence looks good, but we will check it tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I found that my two Shawbrook accounts were visible online, but only one of Angela's. So she phoned and found that one was a postal account, so got it changed to an online account. I also checked an Oaknorth account.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a Zoom meeting (Eurotherm group) and Angela had a WI Zoom meeting. So I used the MacBook in the dining room and she used the study. I then looked for the best one-year fixed-rate account.</p>
