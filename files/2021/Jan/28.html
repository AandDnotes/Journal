        <h1>Thursday 28th January</h1>
        <p>Angela had a very busy day. She went off on her own this morning to do the supermarket shopping, trying to do the best part of two weeks worth. Meanwhile I had a reply from Kent Reliance. It seems that the easy access account, into which they put our matured regular savings account, can only be operated from a branch! However, they said that we could telephone or message instructions. So I sent them a message (from both accounts), asking them to close the accounts and transfer the money to our individual notice accounts. We will see what happens. I also opened a 3-year, fixed-rate bond joint account and made one payment (from one of the matured NS&I accounts) into it. I'll make a second payment when the final NS&I bond matures.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela made a bread pudding (in addition to dinner) while I went into the garage and started the TC. I let it run for 15 minutes and checked things like the lights, including putting the speedo panel light bulb back in the hole in the back of the unit.</p>
        <p>Later, I put the various suggestions into our Zoom webinar guide.</p>
