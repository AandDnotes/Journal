        <h1>Wednesday 13th January</h1>
        <p>Neither of us went out today, but Angela worked hard. Having cooked a batch of Seville oranges yesterday, she made eight jars of marmalade today.</p>
        <p>I had a number of IET-related things to do, which seemed to take most of the morning. Later I checked the sizes of slabs for our design of the walled garden.</p>
