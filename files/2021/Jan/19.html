        <h1>Tuesday 19th January</h1>
        <p>It was a busy day, mainly dealing with IET things. However, I started by checking the new fence while Angela went to the High Street. She bought a lot of meat, enough for over a week. Then we ate vegetarian for dinner!</p>
        <p>The fence looks good, so I photographed it and posted it on our shared Google Photos site. I then paid the fencer and put a review on Checkatrade.</p>
        <p>A lot of the rest of the day was spent creating the January newsletter, at least the draft to which I must add a review of this evenings talk. I also downloaded the recording of last week's talk and created a version for uploading to YouTube, which I did. I also created a CPD certificate for this evenings talk. Then I watched the talk as an attendee. It was good.</p>
