        <h1>Friday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>Angela had left a few things off her shopping list yesterday, so walked back to Hyde Square, via the road this time. Luckily it was calm and sunny. Before she left I phoned Victoria Grand, having failed to get an answer yesterday. It seems that they all had the first part of their COVID-19 vaccination yesterday.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I researched a number of things; the shed we may buy, how we get our British Gas heating insurance to continue and video resolutions.</p>
        <p>After lunch I fixed three horizontal wires to the new fence, putting screws in line with the bars. Then I experimented with searching for a usb port to which a micro:bit is attached.</p>
