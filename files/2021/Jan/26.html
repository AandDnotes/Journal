        <h1>Tuesday 26th January</h1>
        <p>We had planned to go for a walk this morning, but it started raining. The only job I did today was to bleed the study radiator. Otherwise I did a few things that resulted from the yesterday's committee meeting, including creating an icon to use on the Sussex Network web site as a link to the talks programme.</p>
        <p>After lunch I attended the RCEA AGM via Zoom. During that, Angela went for a walk on her own.</p>
