        <h1>Sunday 24th January</h1>
        <p>I read the newspaper while Angela had her Zoom church service. I also spent some time reading about coding with tkinter within python. There is a lot more to read.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul et al. They have a curfew in the Netherlands, starting at 9pm.</p>
