        <h1>Thursday 21st January</h1>
        <p>A better day. The sun shone this morning, although there was a chilly breeze. However, storm Christoph had passed and so the wind was much lower. We were much luckier here than in Warrington and other areas in the North, where there was flooding.</p>
        <p>We though we would go for a walk and decided to combine that with doing some food shopping. So we walked to Beeding, via Clays Field and back via two routes. I went up the 'cows field' and Angela walked up Clays Hill. She got home before me. But we were out for an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>After lunch I repeatedly tried to phone Dad, but could not get an answer from Victoria Grand. What I did manage to do, however, was to get my python compass graphic to move as the micro:bit is rotated. I now want to port it to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
