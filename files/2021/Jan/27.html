        <h1>Wednesday 27th January</h1>
        <p>We were expecting a dry day and therefore a chance to go for a walk. However, it was raining this morning. So the morning was really just checking things and preparing for this evening's IET events meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch it had stopped raining and so we went for a walk, although we stayed on pavements and walked around Penlands. I then completed generating and uploading CPD certificates for past recordings of talks.</p>
        <p>This evening was then mainly about the IET events meeting. We got off to a good start.</p>
