        <h1>Tuesday 5th January</h1>
        <p>Overcast and cold, with the occasional spit of rain. Angela started by walking to the Coop to buy a few things. Meanwhile, I started taking down the Christmas decorations. Angela had taken down the cards yesterday, so I removed the lights and put them in there boxes. We then stripped the tree and put it in the garage, whereas the old case containing the decorations went into the loft.</p>
        <p>We then marked out my walled garden plan with canes and chalk. Angela is not convinced, so some alternatives are needed.</p>
        <p>Yesterday I received an email about an intern programme for SMEs being organised by Brighton and Sussex Universities, so after lunch I spent a while creating an Adestra email to point our members to the details. Their first webinar about the programme takes place tomorrow, so luckily I managed to get it approved and launched before the end of the working day.</p>
        <p>I then started adding a little to my 'how things are done' web pages. The idea is to see if Angela finds them useful.</p>
