        <h1>Wednesday 20th January</h1>
        <p>Angela's trip into the kitchen garden to put out bread for the bird was the only time one of us stepped out of the door today. Since it rained most of the day it wasn't too much of a handicap.</p>
        <p>I spent my day on two main tasks; finishing the January Newsletter and getting is approved, setting up new fixed-rate savings accounts. In fact I decided to set up a joint account with Skipton Building Society, but had problems setting the passwords. Eventually I got it sorted, set up a two-year account and transferred money into it.</p>
        <p>As for the newsletter, I finished drafting it, sent it to Greg, who made comments, edited it and sent it for approval, had it rejected, corrected it, re-submitted it and got it approved.</p>
