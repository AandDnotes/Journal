        <h1>Tuesday 12th January</h1>
        <p>As we went to bed last night we noticed that the fence had blown down again! This time though it was only one panel and it had blown into our garden. The other panel was blowing around a bit. This morning it was raining, so we left the fence until a little later. We were able to fix the panels back in place, with the prop and rope. We also removed the plastic mesh and Angela pruned back the climbing plants.</p>
        <p>When we had finished with the fence we went into the walled garden and measured out an alternative design. As a result I created a slightly modified design with which Angela is happy and I think looks quite good. It's not as radical as my preferred design. but it should work.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended an IET Sussex talk. I was the backup, but luckily Mike's broadband just about survived.</p>
