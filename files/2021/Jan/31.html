        <h1>Sunday 31st January</h1>
        <p>A sad day. We had an email from Anthony to say that Aunt Joan had phoned to say that Uncle Mick passed away at lunchtime. He had been in a hospice for ten days. Aunt Joad tried to call Dad, but could not get through. We found the same; the call immediately went through to the answerphone. I spoke with Alan a couple of times.</p>
        <p>Angela had her Zoom church service this morning and I finished putting the 'how to find passwords' page on to Github.</p>
        <p>It started raining at lunchtime, so we stayed inside. We spoke with Paul a little earlier than usual, since I had planned to phone Dad before he had his supper. I also experimented more with python.</p>
