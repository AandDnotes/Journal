        <h1>Thursday 7th January</h1>
        <p>Another day indoors. At least it was brighter and dry, if cold. However, Angela did go to the butchers.</p>
        <p>After dealing with several IET-related email I spent some time updating the style sheets in most of my web sites so as to include a font that is available on the iPad. It is a bit late, but my decision to use a specific style sheet for each site or page has proved to be difficult to maintain. I could include a base style sheet in every case, but that is quite a lot of work.</p>
        <p>After lunch I spoke with Dad and later called Alan. Dad's COVID-19 test result was negative, but he said that the woman in the next room was unwell and he couldn't talk with her. We have not not yet heard when he will get is vaccination.</p>
        <p>Later still I produced three more designs for the walled garden, but none of them look very god.</p>
        <p>The news broadcasts at lunchtime, early evening and later were dominated by the events in Washington DC and by the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases.</p>
