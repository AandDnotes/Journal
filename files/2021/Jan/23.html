        <h1>Saturday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>A dry, if somewhat chilly morning. So I put on long pants before we walked to the High Street. We kept to the pavements since it is still very wet underfoot. While I bought a newspaper and some rolls, Angela went into the Coop and came out with quite a heavy bag. In addition to her list she had seen a wine that we like on offer. Before lunch I tried to sort out my python code, but got no further.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They are expecting to take ownership of their new house on Friday, after which they will spend a few weeks moving over. Then Angela went for another walk while I did my Dutch lesson. Then I again 'played' with my python code, but still got no further.</p>
