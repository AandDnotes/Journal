        <h1>Saturday 9th January</h1>
        <p>It was the usual Saturday morning walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. However, it wasn't bread rolls that we also bought today, but marmalade oranges from the Produce shop. Although there was no frost it was overcast all day, with low fog at some points, and so felt colder than yesterday.</p>
        <p>So some time was spent reading the paper. However, I did the weekly accounts, including a reconciliation against the bank statement, and added a page on online banking to my 'how to' site.</p>
        <p>After lunch we tried talking with Victoria, but the connection kept failing. Later in the afternoon she called us again, this time using Brandon's phone. He had found the same problem trying to talk to Gene and concluded that there was something wrong with the way he had set up restrictions on the devices that the children use. So overall we spent quite a long time talking (and trying to talk) with Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>We also spent some time looking at the various designs I had drawn for the walled garden and looking at options for paving. I started modifying the design that comes closest to what Angela wants.</p>
