        <h1>Friday 15th January</h1>
        <p>Finally a dry day. Although it looks as though it will be shorted lived. So we decided to go for a walk; similar to the one we did a week ago. However, this time, after dropping off a book at the library, we walked down Kings Stone Avenue before cutting down onto the path to the castle, then 'around' Clays Field and back up the Bostal Road.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did yet another version of the walled garden plan. Then I sorted out my payment of SRFC and BMFA membership fees.</p>
