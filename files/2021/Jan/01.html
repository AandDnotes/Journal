        <h1>Friday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Years Day! A cold, overcast, but dry and calm day. So we didn't go out. I made more modifications to the walled garden plan and Angela found the errors in the jigsaw puzzle and completed it. So I had the pleasure of taking it all apart (after taking a photo).</p>
        <p>We then spent some time searching for plastic sheds and are now considering a store, rather than a shed. Angela will then have space for a compost bin next to it.</p>
