        <h1>Sunday 8th August</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, particularly for Angela. She started by going to church, but came home quickly afterwards so that we could go to the WSMGOC barbecue at Fran and Davids house. It had rained heavily for most of the morning, but the sun was trying to break through when we left at about a quarter to twelve. Then there was torrential rain on the way, which stopped before we arrived. We could smell the barbecue when we parked across the road at about twelve fifteen and we found that most people had already arrived and were starting to eat. Luckily it stayed dry and even became sunny and warm. So we had a good meal outside, along with chats to various members of the club. We also won a bottle of wine in the raffle.</p>
        <p>We left earlier than some so that we could get back to call Paul and then had a short continuation call with Victoria.</p>
