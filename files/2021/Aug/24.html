        <h1>Tuesday 24th August</h1>
        <p>For me, today was all about changing all the oil in the TC, Although firstly I had to finish tightening and adjusting the doors. What I thought were three screws holding the top hinge to the frame, turned out to be one screw and two set screws, the latter with their nuts inside the frame. On the near-side I was able to ease back the trim and get a finger in to help stop the nut from turning. They are not very tight, but better. The off-side door was better, but it didn't easily close. I removed the top of a plastic plug under the latch plate, which moved it slightly outwards and allowed the door to close without slamming too hard.</p>
        <p>After lunch the oils that I'd ordered arrived earlier than expected. Angela went to the High Street. She was planning to cook a rice pudding, but didn't have any rice! I spoke with Dad and then a little later than planned I took the TC for a run to warm the engine, gearbox and differential. I drove through Henfield and Partridge Green; a total of 17 miles. Perhaps a little further than I needed to go and it was five o'clock before I got back. Then I put the car on axle stands (always a bit of an effort) and removed the drain plugs and the oil filter. I left them to drain, mainly because it was dinner time and I was worn out.</p>
