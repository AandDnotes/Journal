        <h1>Saturday 21st August</h1>
        <p>Being a Saturday we started by walking down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. We also looked in the charity shops for a potential painting for the cloakroom, but nothing took our fancy. After reading some of the paper I did the weekly accounts and paid Dad's paper bill. It was then time for a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch I rearranged some of the hooks in the garden store, only to find that the wire rack, when fitted to the left-hand door, would not close when the garden fork was hanging up. So for the moment it is standing on the floor.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria.</p>
