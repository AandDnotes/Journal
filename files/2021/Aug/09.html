        <h1>Monday 9th August</h1>
        <p>I had made some lunch and was ready to put my walking boots on when I checked email and found that Martin had postponed today's walk until next week. So I spent some time reading the newspaper. Angela's 'exercise' session at the church was also cancelled, due to the weather. However, it didn't rain again after about eleven.</p>
        <p>I spent some time working on my game of pong. It now works, to a fashion. After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. The pub was very busy and there were a lot of people at the meeting. It was just a natter.</p>
