        <h1>Monday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>David F-B phoned while I was in the shower to ask if I was going on the next Sussex Wanderers run to Parham. So I phoned David Griffiths and booked my place. What I hadn't realised was that you had to pay to go in the gardens as well as for your lunch, so it is an expensive lunch. I also had an email to say that my oil would be delivered tomorrow. So after Angela had gone to her 'exercise' session, I walked down to the pharmacy to pick up my repeat prescription. I also phoned the builder to tell him that the shed was empty. he will try to come towards the end of next week. I also emailed Leaneys about the non-appearance of our new shower door.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started doing jobs on the TC, but didn't get very far. I found that some door hinge screws would continue to turn if you try to tighten them, but I wasn't able to get them out.</p>
