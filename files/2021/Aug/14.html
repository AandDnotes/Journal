        <h1>Saturday 14th August</h1>
        <p>The building after the painting. While Angela walked to the High Street, I started building the new garden store. My new drill/screwdriver worked very well. It would have been very difficult with a hand screwdriver. We managed to rework the end of the raised flower bed and then put the four main panels together, along with the top and bottom front rails. I also made the missing block that is one of those used to fix the roof to the walls.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we spoke with Victoria, deciding to move our weekly chat to after dinner.</p>
