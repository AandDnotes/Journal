        <h1>Friday 6th August</h1>
        <p>After a slightly smaller breakfast in the hotel we set off for Kew Bridge station. We were quite early, just missed a train to Clapham Junction, but caught the next, even though it was earlier than the one we had intended catching. That meant that we arrived at Clapham Junction much earlier than intended and so had a long wait for our train, since we had a ticket for a specific train. We also had a bit of a wait for the bus, but we were home by about 1:15.</p>
        <p>Angela had a WI committee meeting, so we just had a light lunch. Afterwards I unpacked, phoned Dad, phoned David Farer-Brown (who had left a message to call him about the South Downs Run) and looked at a dozen email.</p>
