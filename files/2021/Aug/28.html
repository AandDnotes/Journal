        <h1>Saturday 28th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the high Street to buy a newspaper I continued with servicing the TC. I took it for a run to warm the engine and then adjusted the tappets. I also cleaned and checked the points and cleaned the spark plugs. Those for cylinders three and four were sooty, so I raised the jet on the rear carburettor by two flats. Afterwards I took the car for another run (just my usual figure of eight) and it seemed to be running very well. There does, however, still seem to be fuel weeping from somewhere, probably the jet assemblies.</p>
        <p>After lunch (and doing our Dutch lessons) we went for a walk. around the river valley. It took us a little over two and a half hours. We did not get home until six o'clock, feeling very tired. After dinner we spoke with Victoria; the usual chaos.</p>
