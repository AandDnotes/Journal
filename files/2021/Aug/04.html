        <h1>Wednesday 4th August</h1>
        <p>We were expecting quite a bit of rain today. But it didn't arrive, at least wherever we were. Our journey to Kew was smooth, but tiring, starting with the 1:30 pm bus and arriving at the hotel twenty past four. The only slight glitch was that the platforms numbers at Clapham Junction were different to those published. However, a helpful Southern Railways man on the platform told us which platform we needed. We started wearing a sweater and a kagool, but it was too hot.</p>
        <p>After checking in (and having a cup of tea) we walked along the river path, under Kew Bridge, looking at pubs. We walked back to 'One Over the Ait' next to the bridge and had a meal, sitting outside.</p>
