        <h1>Wednesday 11th August</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Angela went off walking just before 9:30 and I took out the TC just after ten. Angela went up Sopers Lane and around the upper horseshoe; I drove to Ashington to meet the rest of the Sussex Wanderers and then followed a similar route to our run to Leanardslee, but stopping at Maplehurst for a barbecue. There were over sixty people.</p>
        <p>It was a little cloudier than we had expected, but by the time we left the Red Lion at Ashington the sun was out and stayed out for the rest of the day. I got home at 3:30 after doing 41 miles.</p>
