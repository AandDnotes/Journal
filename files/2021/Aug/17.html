        <h1>Tuesday 17th August</h1>
        <p>We had an excellent day out. Angela popped down to the Steyning Centre before we set off to Chichester. We arrived there just before midday and were surprised to find that there were quite a few empty car-parking spaces. So we had some lunch in the theatre cafe and then walked into the city, really just to look around. We bought a new file box on the way.</p>
        <p>The theatre was nearly full and the production of 'South Pacific' was fantastic. We got home at about six thirty and bought fish and chips from the High Street.</p>
