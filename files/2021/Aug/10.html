        <h1>Tuesday 10th August</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Angela went to the High Street and I phoned Dad, checked over the cars and then took the TC to Beeding to get some petrol. It took quite a while to start, but ran ok.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I zapped weeds on the drive. I also 'bagged' the spoil from the garden store base so that we could use the old tubs to remove some of the 'hot bin' content. It was very wet and the top collapsed before we removed the whole bottom layer.</p>
