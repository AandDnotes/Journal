        <h1>Sunday 29th August</h1>
        <p>A less exhausting day. Angela went to church, but I ventured no further than the drive. While Angela was out I did the weekly accounts and then 'played' with the photos that I took yesterday. So I posted a couple of small photos of donkeys and also a panorama of the downs, with the river in the foreground. I also tried to work out how the gearbox in the TC actually works. I'm getting there, but not quite.</p>
        <p>After a longish lunch Angela pottered in the garden and I zapped some weeds on the drive before we spoke with Paul (and briefly with Rowan). Then more weed zapping before dinner. It's surprising how quickly the weeds grow between the pavers on the drive.</p>
