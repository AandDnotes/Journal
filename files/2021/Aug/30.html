        <h1>Monday 30th August</h1>
        <p>The high pressure that has been dominating our weather over the past week is still with us. So it was another grey day. However, the forecast is that it will be raining by Sunday, the day of the South Downs Run! I took the TC to Beeding to get 30 litres of fuel in preparation for the SDR. The jets on the carbs are still weeping.</p>
        <p>There was quite a lot of newspaper reading today, although, while Angela was repotting house plants outside, I finished 'zapping' weeds on the drive and cleared out the gutters. There was a lot of moss off the roof in the front gutter. Otherwise I spent quite a lot of time researching LED bulbs for the TC. Perhaps something for the future.</p>
