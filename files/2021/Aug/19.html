        <h1>Thursday 19th August</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. I started by taking a lateral flow test before breakfast and then went to the dentist to have my broken tooth 'repaired'. The hole was filled, but is now 80% filling! If any more breaks off then I will need a crown.</p>
        <p>I was home by 9:30 and we then went off to Worthing. I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's and then went off to see Dad. He was well and was still wearing his new glasses. On the way back to Sainsbury's I called into Argos to buy a shelving unit for the garden store. Angela had finished shopping and had had coffee. I waited until we were home.</p>
        <p>After lunch we started moving things into the garden store. We also sorted out things to take to the tip tomorrow and put them in the back of the Panda.</p>
