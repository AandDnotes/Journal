        <h1>Thursday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our 49th wedding anniversary. And we had an excellent day at Kew Gardens. In spite of the weather forecast, we had quite a lot of sun during the morning and only a little rain as we were thinking of leaving. It was quite exhausting and so, having arrived at 10:15, we left at 2:30.</p>
        <p>We just got back to the hotel when it rained more heavily. I uploaded a couple of photos and both Paul and Krista commented on them. Luckily it was down to a drizzle when we went out for a meal. We ended up at the same place as last night, but eat inside. It was a bit noisy and the service was off and the chips were hard. We were back by about eight.</p>
