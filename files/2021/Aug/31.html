        <h1>Tuesday 31st August</h1>
        <p>The end of meteorological summer, but it already feels like autumn, being another grey day. While Angela went to the High Street I drafted an email to IET Sussex members asking for a volunteer to take on the role of Deputy Chair and sent it to Julie for comment. She replied quite quickly.</p>
        <p>I also 'wiped' down the TC and put wax on the paintwork. The forecast is still for rain on Sunday, so I want to give it some protection. I also put more RainX on the windscreen. After that I started experimenting with the production of a joint events programme document.</p>
