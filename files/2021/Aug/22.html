        <h1>Sunday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>Another quite busy day, and a fine one too. While Angela was at church I finished clearing the old shed and started painting the back gate. I finished it after lunch, so we now have a green/blue gate and a green/brown garden store.</p>
        <p>I finished painting just in time to have a FaceTime call with Paul. Rowan wasn't very talkative.</p>
