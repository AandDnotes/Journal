        <h1>Saturday 7th August</h1>
        <p>Angela was up early icing a cake for the coffee morning at the church. We then walked to Castle Lane (the other side of the bypass) to deliver a letter and then back to the church. I went on to buy a newspaper and then home to do the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to Sainsbury's to do a small grocery shop. I read the paper and played with my python code. When she got home she made a trifle for tomorrow's WSMGOC barbecue. Later we spoke with Victoria until her painter phoned. We didn't see the children.</p>
