        <h1>Friday 13th August</h1>
        <p>Today was all about painting; painting the pieces of the new garden store. The milkman did not come this morning, so Angela went down to the Coop and I started painting. After lunch Angela helped, but we got it all done, ready to start putting it together tomorrow.</p>
