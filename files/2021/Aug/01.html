        <h1>Sunday 1st August</h1>
        <p>Another lazy day. In fact, the only time I stepped out of the house was to put stuff in the bin. Angela, of course, went to church. Luckily it stayed dry, in fact it only rained a couple of times later in the day and it was quite calm. I 'tidied' entries in the accounts, checking that Dad had enough in his account and that Milkandmore had refunded the missed delivery.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, a lot of my day was spent playing with my python code, without much success. Angela did some vacuuming and later we spoke with Paul. While preparing the starter for dinner, Victoria messaged about kitchen cupboard handles. So I sent several photos of ours.</p>
