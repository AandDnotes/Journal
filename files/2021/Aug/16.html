        <h1>Monday 16th August</h1>
        <p>An exhausting day. It started with Angela doing a lateral flow test because she was going to a WI meeting after lunch. However, she left the house just before ten and I left at about twenty past. Angela went to the church for her exercise group and I joined the Eurotherm group at Bramber for a 6.75 mile circular walk around the Adur valley. We stopped on the way for lunch and then went into the Castle Hotel garden. I had a pint of Harveys, which went down very well. I then had a slow walk home via the 'cows field', arriving at about 4:20. Angela arrived home from her WI meeting an hour later. They had more people in the audience than expected.</p>
