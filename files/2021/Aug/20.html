        <h1>Friday 20th August</h1>
        <p>Once again I feel worn out at the end of the day. We started by taking the car load of rubbish to the tip at Shoreham. Their booking system seemed to make it easier, without queues or too many people. From there we went on to Maybury Garden Centre for coffee. I tried to go next door to Speedy Spares, but found that they were on their summer break and would not be open until Monday. Meanwhile, Angela was looking at the plants and then we bought a small gift to send to Juniper for her birthday.</p>
        <p>We got home just before lunch, so that was our morning taken care of. After lunch I ordered engine oil, gear oil and lead substitute (with free delivery) and we moved a few more things into the new garden store. I hung up a few small garden hand tools, fitted two short lengths of drain pipe for holding canes and fixed a wire rack to the inside of one of the doors.</p>
