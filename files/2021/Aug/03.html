        <h1>Tuesday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>We had an outing to the shopping area of Worthing today for the first time for quite a while. Our next-door-but-one neighbour, Barbara, had an opticians appointment in Worthing this afternoon and was planning to catch two busses to get there. So we took her. It also meant that Angela could look for a black cardigan (not really the right time of year, there being more tee shirts and shorts on the rails) and a folder to help organise her recipe cuttings. She found the latter, but not the former. On the way home we called into Leaneys to swap out 'holed' shower waste pot for an un-holed version.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day I spoke with Dad and checked the rail stations between Clapham Junction and Kew Bridge. I also had a little 'play' with my python code. I got the ball moving as I wanted it to do.</p>
        <p>We also discovered that our bus passes went out of date in March! We planned to use them tomorrow. We can only assume that renewal notices went to Kingsmead Close. After returning from Worthing I applied to renew them.</p>
