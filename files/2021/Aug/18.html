        <h1>Wednesday 18th August</h1>
        <p>A quieter day. Angela went off walking with her WI group, catching the bus to Shoreham and then walking back. I, meanwhile, finished the garden store. I moved the short piece of wood under the door batten to the door edge and turned the bolt upside down so that the screw holes lined up. Later I entered a review; 6/10, although we are pleased with the end result.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela emptied some of the shed and we tried the shelves in the store. We decided that it was too big and so decided to get a smaller set of shelves. However, I did post a photo of the store on Google Photos.</p>
