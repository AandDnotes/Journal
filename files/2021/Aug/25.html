        <h1>Wednesday 25th August</h1>
        <p>Angela left to join her WI walking group before I had finished in the shower. Then I went into the garage to start putting oil back into the engine, gearbox and differential of the TC. By the time that Angela got home the Engine, with filter, and the gearbox were done and I was ready to start filling the differential, having removed the floor from the tonneau area. So by the end of the day the new oils were in and the oil oils were in containers (a very messy job), waiting for the next visit to the tip.</p>
        <p>I was also able to grease all the points and top up the fluid in the dampers, one of which was lower than I had expected. I also checked the tightness of the differential and rear connection of the prop-shaft.</p>
