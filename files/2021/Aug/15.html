        <h1>Sunday 15th August</h1>
        <p>A second day of shed building and still not finished. The basic store is built; just the locks to fix. The roof panel was only as wide as the store, with no overhang, which was disappointing. Also, the top front bar, which I had fixed flush with the sides as instructed, was too far forward, preventing the top hinge from sitting on the cover strip. Since the front blocks on the roof were fixed from under the felt I had to chisel out a little of the front bar so that it would sit further back. Then the centre baton on the doors, into which you screw the bolt, does not reach the edge of the door, so the bolt would not reach far enough into the piece on the other door. I gave up at this point. I will need to add another piece of wood behind the door to accept the screws. Then I just need to fix the top and bottom slide bolts on the 'fixed' door and the cover strip over the join between the doors.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church in the morning and pottered in the garden later. At four o'clock we stopped for a cup of tea and spoke with Paul.</p>
