        <h1>Thursday 26th August</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm. Angela went into Sainsbury's and I went to B&amp;Q to buy antifreeze. However they only had one litre bottles of 'ready to use' antifreeze. So we came home via Halfords at Shoreham. I thought that I had bought 'blue' ethylene glycol antifreeze, but later discovered that it is red and according to the data sheet it contains OAT elements. I will take it back tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Last night I realised that the soft paint on the nearside front backplate could be caused by leaking brake fluid. However, I could not find any leakage. So I removed each wheel and re-greased the splines. Then I drained the coolant, with a little difficulty. I had to tape some tubing to a funnel and position several bolws under the car.</p>
