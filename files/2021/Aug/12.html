        <h1>Thursday 12th August</h1>
        <p>We were expecting the garden store to be delivered between eight and twelve, so I was dressed before breakfast. The store arrived at ten to twelve! However, it was drizzling when we got up, but stopped in time for me to raise two of the slabs that make the base. However, I couldn't dig out the soil from under the vertical slab at the end of the raised bed, since there is concrete in the way. I also tightened the bolts on the TC that hold the float chambers to the bodies of the carburettors in the hope that will stop them leaking.</p>
        <p>When the store arrived I discovered that there is quite a lot of work to do to put it together and the guarantee is conditional on treating the wood before you put it together. So we went off to Lyons Farm and, while Angela did a small shop, I bought some green timber preservative/colour.</p>
