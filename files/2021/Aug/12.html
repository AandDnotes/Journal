        <h1>Thursday 12th August</h1>
        <p>We were expecting the garden store to be delivered between eight and twelve, so I was dressed before breakfast. The store arrived at ten to twelve! However, it was drizzling when we got up, but stopped in time for me to raise two of the slabs that make the base. However, I couldn't dig out the soil from under the vertical slab at the end of the raised bed, since there is concrete in the way. I also tightened the bolts on the TC that hold the float chambers to the bodies of the carburettors in the hope that will stop them leaking. During the day I also put two coats of paint on chips on the dashboard surround, where the frame of the side screens hit it when the doors are slammed. I had already glued a piece of rubber (webbing) on the near-side frame, so added a piece to the off-side frame. I really need to have another go at adjusting the door catches.</p>
        <p>When the store arrived I discovered that there is quite a lot of work to do to put it together and the guarantee is conditional on treating the wood before you do so. So we went off to Lyons Farm and, while Angela did a small shop in Sainsbury's, I bought some green timber preservative/colour in B&amp;Q.</p>
