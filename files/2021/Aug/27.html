        <h1>Friday 27th August</h1>
        <p>I started by returning the antifreeze to Halfords (they did not have the 'blue' version), but then found that Speedy Spares were closed. I phoned them and found that they are only doing mail order and telephone/collect service. So I ordered five litres of 'blue' antifreeze and collected it after lunch. The milkman did not deliver, so Angela went to the Coop, also buying some milk for Barbara.</p>
        <p>When I got home with the antifreeze, Angela went off to deliver some letters, taking a very long route to someone in Beeding. Meanwhile, I put two litres of antifreeze and four of water (from the water but) into the radiator. It is supposed to hold eight litres! So may need topping up after the engine has run. I then checked the oil in the steering box and lowered the car to the ground, ready to take it for a run to warm the engine before adjusting the tappets.</p>
