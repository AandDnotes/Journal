        <h1>Tuesday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>Angela started by walking right down to Anita's house to deliver a letter, while I completed my actions from yesterday's IET meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleaned out the gutters. I expected the front gutters to be full of leaves, but they were clear. It was really just a little of the usual grit and the down-pipe balloons blocked. I then downloaded a new Raspberry pi OS image and wrote it to a memory card.</p>
