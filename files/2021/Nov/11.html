        <h1>Thursday 11th November</h1>
        <p>We had an extended shopping outing this morning. After doing the weekly grocery shop at Sainsbury's we went on to Shires garden centre, primarily looking for bird feeders. So it was lunchtime before we got home.</p>
        <p>Just before lunch My 'prize' from ISA Automation arrived. It is a very large mug with an orange interior.</p>
        <p>Later I went into the garage to look at the TC's hood frame. I found that the middle hoop is fixed to the rest of the frame with two stubby, countersunk, self-tapping screws. Both screws were missing on the off-side  and the screw I had found yesterday in the passenger footwell had come out of the near-side of the frame, leaving the hoop held on by only one screw. I removed the back of the seats and found that the seat bases hinge forward. I found one screw on the off-side, although it is smaller than those used on the near-side, and was able to vacuum the floor under the seats for the first time.</p>
