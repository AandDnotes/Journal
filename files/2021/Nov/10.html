        <h1>Wednesday 10th November</h1>
        <p>For me it was a TC day. I set off just before ten o'clock and met up with the other Sussex Wanderers at the George and Dragon at Dragon's Green, just north of the A272 near Shipley. There must have been about 50 people. The ground was damp and there was a little drizzle in the air, so I kept the hood up. On the way I could hear a rattle that seemed to be coming from the hood frame. When I got there I discovered that a rivet or bolt had come out of the frame on one side and so it was clattering. Whatever has fallen out is probably on the floor. It has been some time since I drove the car with the hood up, so I don't know when the rivet/bolt came out.</p>
        <p>After coffee and biscuits we set off to Bolney, where we had lunch. I knew all the roads on the route and they were mainly wider, better surfaced roads, as befits this time of year. I arrived home at three o'clock having done a total of 57 miles, probably more than usual at 50 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela had gone to her table tennis club. Before dinner/tea we caught up with 'Our Yorkshire Farm'.</p>
