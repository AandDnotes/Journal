        <h1>Thursday 18th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning on her own to do the weekly groceries shop. I spent most of the time she was out creating some of my November newsletter. Without many events I'm having to make up some parts.</p>
        <p>Later I lifted the front wheels of the TC off the ground and checked the tightness of the cotter pin and the damper on the near-side. Angela was off again, this time to the butchers in the High Street. She then baked a cake for the Christmas fair on Saturday.</p>
