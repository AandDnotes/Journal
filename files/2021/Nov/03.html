        <h1>Wednesday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>It was the coldest morning of the autumn so far, with frost on the garage and garden store roofs. However, most of the day was sunny and calm, even if it didn't get above 12 degrees. When I went out at twenty to three the cloud was thickening and I thought it might rain, but it stayed dry.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a good part of the morning going to the library (apparently a car had driven into the end wall, which was being repaired) and to the High Street. I emailed the text for the new Sussex home page and volunteered myself and Ferheen to help test the new site.</p>
        <p>After lunch, after Angela had left for table tennis, I had to interrupt my Dutch lesson to walk down to the Cobblestone Tea House to meet Marnie Middlemiss. We just talked about the estate developments at Brighton and the philanthropy strategy. I got home at half past four.</p>
