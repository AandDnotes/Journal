        <h1>Sunday 21st November</h1>
        <p>It was a fairly normal Sunday morning. Angela went to church while I dealt with some IET email and checked the TC's carburettors for leaks, which I didn't find. I think I will need to at least run the engine to investigate further. However, I did hang out the washing to dry.</p>
        <p>We went off at two o'clock to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. We had planned to have FaceTime calls with Victoria and Paul, but found that they had changed their internet service provider. No one knew the password and, in fact, the line that is used for the connection was not working! I asked Caroline to let it be known that we were not happy. We had not been told about the telephone number changes or that the wifi had changed and no one knew the password.</p>
        <p>Dad seemed quite well, although, for some reason, he had put most of his birthday cards in his top draw. I did show him some photos on my phone and cleaned his electric razor.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Paul and then Victoria wen we got home.</p>
