        <h1>Friday 19th November</h1>
        <p>Dad's 98th birthday! While Angela was at the Methodist Church helping to set up for tomorrow's Winter Fair, I spoke with Dad (after some confusion with the phone numbers again). Hopefully Alan and Chris will visit him this afternoon. Other than that, I finished the November newsletter, which I sent to Greg for review after lunch.</p>
        <p>When Angela got home she baked cakes for the fair, walking down to the High Street to get some cake decorations. I spent a little time in the garage looking at the carburettors. There was fuel under the float chambers, but nowhere else. The chambers were empty, so I ran the pump and left it to see if anything leaks.</p>
