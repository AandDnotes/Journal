        <h1>Saturday 27th November</h1>
        <p>It was Saturday, so we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper. With the north wind it was probably the coldest that it has been this year. So it was a case of getting there and back as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>We read some of the paper, of course, but then I did the weekly accounts. Then I re-installed the Chromium Browser on the raspberry pi, but it still would not start. So I removed it and installed a browser called Midori, which worked.</p>
        <p>I investigated the source of the cold draught that comes from behind the extractor fan. However, it must be coming down the back of the cupboards, since there are no holes at the back of the unit, apart from around the flue. I also tightened the lock on the mail box.</p>
        <p>Later I did some more investigation of port forwarding, before we spoke with Victoria et al. It seems that Brandon's sister's children were unwell, Gene caught it and they went home early.</p>
