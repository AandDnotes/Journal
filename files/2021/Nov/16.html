        <h1>Tuesday 16th November</h1>
        <p>I didn't put my nose outside at all today. Angela, however, took the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash this morning and walked to far Beeding and back this afternoon to deliver letters to WI members.</p>
        <p>I added firstly £10 to my new Investec account and then £23,000. I'll transfer the rest tomorrow. Otherwise it was a collection of emails and I added my page on the TC's hood frame to my web site.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended an IET talk on AI (actually the use of fuzzy logic) applied to 'micro' power generators.</p>
