        <h1>Monday 8th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her 'exercise' group (apparently it was someone's birthday, so they didn't do any exercises) I sorted our CPD certificates with the new President's signature. I also phoned Burlen/SU for advice about my weeping carburettors, but they only suggested cleaning the threads. Then I moved on to creating my own version of the diagram that I had copied from the EuroPart catalogue. Later I replaced the diagram in my article.</p>
        <p>Later still, I joined the Eurotherm group for their occasional chat. It was then time for an early dinner before we went to the Frankland Arms at Washington for the WSMGOC meeting. We had a talk on climate change from the President of the Sussex Wildlife Trust. It was well presented, although he had a particularly 'nature is the solution' view. We got home at about 9:30.</p>
