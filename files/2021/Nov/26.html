        <h1>Friday 26th November</h1>
        <p>After paying the window cleaners (they came while we were out yesterday morning) I phoned Dad and got my Raspberry pi web server working. Later I spoke with Norman, wrote some notes on yesterday evening's CC-UK Roadshow and sent them to Norman for comment.</p>
        <p>I did a little more research on domain names. It was cold and breezy, so we didn't go out.</p>
