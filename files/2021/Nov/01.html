        <h1>Monday 1st November</h1>
        <p>It was pretty much sunny from morning to dusk. Angela went off to a Lunch Club committee meeting and I took the MG to get some petrol. It takes a while to uncover the car and put down the hood, but I got out eventually. I should probably put the battery on charge before next starting the engine. Although the car ran well, the engine did cut out twice on my short figure of eight circuit; once as I was entering the petrol station forecourt and then again as I was going around the tight bend by Mouse Lane. On both occasions it started straight away when I pulled the starter. When I got home it seemed to be running smoothly, although Angela says there is a strong smell of petrol in the garage.</p>
        <p>I haven't found a navigator for next week's Sussex Wanderers run, so I will need to go alone. Our 'Eurotherm group' meeting was postponed, so I didn't get a chance to solicit interest.</p>
        <p>Just before lunch Mike Underhill asked me to back him up on tomorrow's talk and if I could produce an introductory slide. I said yes to both and later in the afternoon sent him the slide. I also attended most of a session on the new IET Communities web site. I was late going to the study and then had problems joining, so I missed the first 15 minutes. However, I was able to ask four questions, although one remains unanswered.</p>
