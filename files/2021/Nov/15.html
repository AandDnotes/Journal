        <h1>Monday 15th November</h1>
        <p>Angela was out early to visit a caterer for their WI tea and then went on to her 'exercise' group. After an early lunch she went to her WI AGM. Unfortunately they found a new President, so they have to carry on.</p>
        <p>So I had most of the day to myself. I started with an unnecessary walk down to the pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription. I should have looked in the bathroom cabinet first! I paid Dad's paper bill and sent a few IET-related email, including instructions on how to download the Sussex programme booklet. I also researched one-year, fixed rate savings account and opened one with Investec. It was quite a 'high-tech' process.</p>
