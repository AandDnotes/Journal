        <h1>Sunday 14th November</h1>
        <p>A cold, overcast, but not too cold a day. Angela went to church while I started making notes for the November newsletter. I emailed a couple of people to ask for contributions and emailed Julie Hudson about recordings of the last two talks.</p>
        <p>A pigeon knocked the bird feeder in the walled garden off its hook, so I modified my wire hook and rehung the feeder. I also documented Wednesday's TC run and started creating a web page for the hood frame repair.</p>
        <p>We were supposed to talk with Victoria just after lunch, but she still hadn't been to the supermarket. We finally called her while they were having their lunch and just before we had dinner.</p>
