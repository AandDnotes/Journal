        <h1>Wednesday 24th November</h1>
        <p>I started by transferring Â£3,000 from Dad's RCI account to his current account, ready to pay his rent. I then tested my new Raspberry pi OS and its VNC connection.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to table tennis, I updated the pdf version of our Events Programme booklet with some IET Sussex additions and some RCEA talks. Unfortunately, the IET made all community web pages read-only today until they launch the new version on Monday. So I couldn't upload the revised document.</p>
