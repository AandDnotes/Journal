        <h1>Saturday 13th November</h1>
        <p>Being Saturday we took our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. It was cloudy, but calm and reasonably warm. As usual, the rest of the morning was mainly spent reading the paper, although I did a little more collection of images for the headlight and handle quiz.</p>
        <p>After lunch and our usual attempt at a couple of Dutch lessons I put up the two light-weight brackets; one to the fence in the kitchen garden and the other to the wall in the walled garden.</p>
        <p>Victoria was busy, so we agreed to talk tomorrow.</p>
