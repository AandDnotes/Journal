        <h1>Tuesday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>Most of the morning seemed to be spent on emails, regarding the Sussex Wanderers and the proposed changes to the IET communities web sites. After lunch I went into the garage to look at the petrol leak from the carburettors. I couldn't find the source of the leak other than from the jet assembly.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I joined the panel on today's IET Sussex talk as a backup. We were a bit worried, but the speaker arrived with about two minutes to spare. It was an interesting talk.</p>
