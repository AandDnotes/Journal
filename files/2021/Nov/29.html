        <h1>Monday 29th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her 'exercise' group, I researched establishing a firewall on the pi, as well as changing the user name and password. I also had a call from Victoria Grand asking us to get some incontinence pants for Dad.</p>
        <p>So we spent most of the afternoon going to Lyons Farm to buy the pants in Sainsbury's and an electric razor (for Dad) in Argos. We then went on to Victoria Grand to deliver the pants.</p>
