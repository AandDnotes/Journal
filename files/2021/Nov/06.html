        <h1>Saturday 6th November</h1>
        <p>We stared with our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also bought some rolls and walked through the farmer's market, where we found them collecting recycled material. So Angela walked back down later with some of our collection.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was the usual weekly accounts and a talk with Victoria a little later. Although I did replace the tape on the flex of the iron. There were a few fireworks last night, but tonight there were a lot of 'bangs' from next-door-but-one.</p>
