        <h1>Friday 5th November</h1>
        <p>A day mainly spent in one chair or another. Angela walked to the butchers this morning and then to the High Street again to get some ingredients for biscuits that she made later. I updated my latest article (about kingpins) and read this month's Main Gear. There was only one article; from Tim. I also added details of our latest energy statement to my spreadsheet. We used less gas this October than last. My only exercise was chopping and mixing in the kitchen for Angela.</p>
