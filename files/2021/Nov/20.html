        <h1>Saturday 20th November</h1>
        <p>Angel went off before nine o'clock to help set up the Autumn/Winter/Christmas fair at the church. I walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then did the weekly accounts. I also replied to a number of email and revised my November newsletter.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to go down to the fair. We had soup and the cake for lunch and bought a pot of marmalade (with rum) and some wooden Christmas tree decorations. Later we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. We saw around their new bungalow. They have ground source heating.</p>
