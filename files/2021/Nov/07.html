        <h1>Sunday 7th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I emailed Mike Wooldridge about RCEA entries in our programme booklet and then worked up a spreadsheet to estimate how much we need to provide residential care for us both. This gives us an idea of how much of our savings we need to set aside.</p>
        <p>After lunch I checked the tyre pressures on the cars and put the trickle charger on the MG's battery. I also drilled out the screw on Angela's hair dryer. But it would still not come apart. Later we spoke with Paul et al.</p>
