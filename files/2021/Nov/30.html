        <h1>Tuesday 30th November</h1>
        <p>It was quite a bit warmer today, but that didn't coax me out. Angela went to the High Street and I played with my Raspberry pi web server. Then booked an appointment to visit Dad on Thursday and spoke with him.</p>
        <p>After lunch I installed a firewall on the pi and added a 'port forward' rule to the router. However, although I can ping the external ip address, I couldn't access the pi server.</p>
