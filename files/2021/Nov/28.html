        <h1>Sunday 28th November</h1>
        <p>It was a much brighter day today and the wind had dropped a bit. In fact it was clear blue sky for most of the day. Angela went off to church and I sent my notes on the CC-UK Roadshow to the rest of the committee. I also asked Mike and Ramon to send me details of the equipment they think we will need to stream a hybrid event.</p>
        <p>I then sorted out how to forward an http request and so got the Raspberry pi web server to show my home page when just sending the ip address. I discovered a problem with my home page, which took a while to resolve.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Conny has had some biopsies and if feel a little low. Also, Paul has stomach problems.</p>
