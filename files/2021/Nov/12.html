        <h1>Friday 12th November</h1>
        <p>It was drizzling when we got up and then again when we went to bed. I spent some time in the garage fixing the frame back together and putting the seats back. Later I started collecting images of lights for a possible quiz.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Worthing golf club to an SRFC meeting. The speaker was an ex airline pilot and a balloonist. He told stories, mainly about the Breitling 3 round-the-world balloon trip.</p>
