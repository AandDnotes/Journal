        <h1>Thursday 25th November</h1>
        <p>We spent the morning in Worthing, firstly doing the weekly groceries shop at Lyons Farm and then going into Worthing centre. We looked at jumpers, but didn't find one, and then searched for walking boots for Angela. Luckily she found a pair that seem to be a good fit in Millets.</p>
        <p>So after a late lunch, Angela went to the butchers and I sent an email to Ramon about a speaker and then installed a web server on the Raspberry pi. However, there does not seem to be access to the location of web pages; not that there is a default file there anyway.</p>
        <p>After a very early dinner (in fact I had to take my s=dessert with me to the study) I joined the CC-UK November Roadshow event. It started at 6pm and finished just after eight. I must send a summary to the committee.</p>
