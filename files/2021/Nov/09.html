        <h1>Tuesday 9th November</h1>
        <p>The highlight event for today was our Covid-19 booster jab. After lunch we went off to Henfield, queued for a short while, had our jab, sat down for 15 minutes and then came home.</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela was at a WI committee meeting, I prepared the text of my article and sent it (with the images) to Roger. I also phoned Dad. They had changed the phone number, although it may just be temporary. Then I spent a while replacing the bulb in the outside light by the back door. The screws were rusted and took a while to undo. Luckily we had a spare bulb, with a screw fitting, in our spares box.</p>
