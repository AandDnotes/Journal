        <h1>Thursday 4th November</h1>
        <p>We normally do the weekly supermarket shop on Thursday morning, but today we had arranged to visit Dad after lunch. So we went over to Victoria Grand at two o'clock. We took our lateral flow test and sat in the small lounge for half an hour before going up to see Dad. We showed him photos on the iPad. Then I took a 'selfie' and posted it on Google Photos. Victoria 'liked' it a few minute later. Dad seemed well, but said that he was getting a little lonely because he was mainly staying in his room.</p>
        <p>I spoke with Alan after dinner. It seems that Laura and Richard often have FaceTime calls with Dad.</p>
