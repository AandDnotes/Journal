        <h1>Wednesday 13th October</h1>
        <p>Just before ten I left in the TC for Adversane, to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. The weather couldn't have been better (for this time of year). It was sunny and calm, even if I did need to wear my winter coat and a wooly hat. David F-B arrived just before we needed to set off for Kingsfold. David left his modern TF at the Blacksmith's Arms and we set off on the 25 mile run to The Owl.</p>
        <p>Although the food at the Owl was good, we had to wait over an hour before it came to the tables. I sat with David, Chris and his navigator (Peter). By the time we left it had clouded over. We took the A29 back to Adversane and then I came home via Ashington and Wiston, arriving home at ten to four, shortly before Angela got home from her table tennis. Overall the TC did 63 miles and ran well.</p>
