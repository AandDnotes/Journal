        <h1>Saturday 9th October</h1>
        <p>It was a really autumnal morning, with quite heavy mist. However, as we were walking back from the High Street, where I had bought a newspaper, you could see the sun through the mist and by lunchtime it was sunny. I spent the rest of the morning reading the paper and doing the weekly accounts. I also moved some money from our current account into a savings account.</p>
        <p>During the morning Angela's WI bulbs arrived and after an early lunch she had her hair cut. Quite a lot was taken off. I took the TC for a test run, up through Partridge Green and down through Henfield, a total of 17 miles. The new brake linings seemed to work well and tomorrow I will lift the front and check the tightness of the nuts.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria. She has a heavy cold, but thought that her wore throat was getting a little better. We had a very brief word with Austin and Juniper.</p>
        <p>I sent Ron an update on the TC and told him about our connection with Florida. I sent one email before dinner and a follow-up one after talking with Victoria.</p>
