        <h1>Tuesday 12th October</h1>
        <p>In the morning I finished my write-up of the kingpin replacement.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA talk on railway rolling stock. Actually it was an outline and comparison on the first and second generation Eurostar trains. Interesting, but the presenter, although being very knowledgeable, was not a particularly good speaker. On the way to Field Place I called into Sainsbury's to get some petrol. There was no sign of a queue.</p>
        <p>When I got home I spoke with Dad and arranged to visit him on Thursday.</p>
