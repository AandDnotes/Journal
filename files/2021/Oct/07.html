        <h1>Thursday 7th October</h1>
        <p>I started by taking a poo sample and sending off my colon cancer test. I then sent a request to add our new committee members to our Office 365 account and, after Angela had left for the supermarket, went into the garage. Before lunch I relined the front offside brake shoes. The rivets didn't seem to 'roll' as well as those I used on the rear brakes.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela started making a new cushion cover, I fitted the brake shoes and drums. I was quite worn out by the time I'd finished. In spite of the weather forecast, it was almost continuous drizzle all afternoon.</p>
