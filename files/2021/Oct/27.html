        <h1>Tuesday 27th October</h1>
        <p>An inactive day, at least for me. After lunch Angela went to her table tennis club, so had plenty of exercise.</p>
        <p>My first activity was to update the newsletter and get a draft sent to Greg. He replied later with a couple of minor changes, so I updated it and and submitted it for approval.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I added some apps to the new phone and set up the old iPhone for Angela. I also 'wiped' the old Android so that it is ready to give away.</p>
