        <h1>Friday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>A lazy day, at least for me, after a busy one yesterday. The postman delivered letters into our new mail box just before Angela arrived back from the butchers. He said that it was excellent!</p>
        <p>I phoned Dad and Angela, as usual, was busy in the garden, doing housework and cooking. Meanwhile, I did some reading and prepared a diagram for a planned article.</p>
