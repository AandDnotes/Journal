        <h1>Friday 15th October</h1>
        <p>A fairly quiet day. It was quite late before I got into the garage, but before lunch I checked the tightness of the cotter pins on the TC. The near-side cotter pin still goes further through the axle than I would like, so I might make a slightly thicker shim for it. Angela cut the grass and cleared the area in the kitchen garden for the 'hot bin'.</p>
        <p>Beforehand, I uploaded the before and after photos of the garden and later added an entry on my 'outings' web site for the Sussex Wanderers run on Wednesday. I also received a title and synopsis from my ESA speaker.</p>
