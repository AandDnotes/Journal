        <h1>Thursday 21st October</h1>
        <p>A busy day. After torrential rain yesterday evening, the morning was bright, dry, but windy. That wind had dropped by the evening.</p>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm, were I dropped Angela to start the weekly grocery shop. I then went to Wickes to buy a new light switch, before returning to Argos to buy a mail box. We decided that the postman was having too much difficulty getting mail through our letter box, so decided to fix a box to the wall outside.</p>
        <p>When we got home I fitted the new light switch. I was disappointed that one terminal screw would not turn and that the fixing bolts were too short. I managed to work the terminal screw in (stripping the thread), although it did still tighten, and I used the old fixing bolts.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was time to fit the mail box. It was difficult to get it level because the bricks were uneven and the lower two holes were right on the edge of the bricks. However, I managed to elongate them and pack them with bits of plastic wall plug.</p>
