        <h1>Saturday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>The usual start to a Saturday with a walk to the High Street. Then it was reading the paper that we bought and doing the weekly accounts. I then levelled the slab in the kitchen garden and we moved the hot bin from the walled garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started writing my next article, although I didn't get very far. I also backed up files and updated both the Linux and Windows systems on the old laptop. We were having an early dinner when Victoria called. So we spoke with her while we eat and then for a while afterwards.</p>
