        <h1>Saturday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we started by walking down to the High Street. I bought a newspaper and Angela went into the Coop. We then walked through the market, since it was the first Saturday of the month. Angela bought some cox's apples and I took a photo of the (large) pumpkins.</p>
        <p>Luckily it was dry when we were out, but it soon started raining and continued for most of the rest of the day. I went into the garage before lunch and did the weekly and monthly accounts after lunch. I worked further on the 'shim' for the cotter pin. Luckily I found a washer that is just fits over the cotter and so is the size of the hole in the axle. However, the thinner the shim becomes, so the more difficult it is to file it further. It needs some more work to get it to fit. My hope then is that I can get the cotter and shim in place in the axle.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria. Austin and Juniper were playing outside, since it was a fine day; so we didn't get to talk to them.</p>
