        <h1>Thursday 14th October</h1>
        <p>This morning we went off to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. We were each given a lateral flow test and had to sit in the small conservatory for half an hour before we could go in to see Dad. He was in need of a bit of a shave, although his electric razor is a bit clogged up. Somehow he now has an Echo Dot in his room. Later we had a call from Victoria Grand to ask if he has had an eye test in the last year. This has been asked by the 'falls unit'.</p>
        <p>We then went to Waitrose for coffee, but did our weekly shop there as well. We were home just in time to make some lunch so that I could join the live streaming of the IET President's Address at one o'clock. While we were out, Lester's men removed our old shed. The walled garden now looks so much bigger.</p>
        <p>Angela spent the afternoon in the garden. I sent a second email to a potential speaker from the European Space Agency. He replied immediately and is able to give us a talk via Zoom (he is resident in the Netherlands) on February 1st.</p>
        <p>As well as the IET President's address I viewed the 'fireside chat'. We had an early dinner and the stream started at 6:30. Although there was a physical audience, less than 50 people joined the YouTube live stream.</p>
