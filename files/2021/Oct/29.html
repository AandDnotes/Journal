        <h1>Friday 29th October</h1>
        <p>It rained quite a lot this morning, so it was handy that we didn't need to go out. I started by phoning Dad and then checked that his money had been transferred into his current account. Then I emailed the IET Sussex committee about the changes that are coming to our web site.</p>
        <p>I spent a little time starting another page of 'Grandad's Notebook', incorporating the video of my pong game.</p>
        <p>Later we marked out the current (final?) design for the walled garden and I produced a paper version. Since I had received another email from TalkTalk about installing their cyber-security software, I also started reading notes on Mac OS inbuilt security.</p>
