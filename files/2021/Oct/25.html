        <h1>Monday 25th October</h1>
        <p>A more energetic day. Angela went to her 'exercise' group while I added a little to my article and started adding to my 'pong' game. By the end of the day I had added scoring and started putting in a serve button for each payer.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to give blood. However, the blood flow was slow and the nurse seemed to mess it up, so they gave up! Meanwhile I went for a walk; up the twitten, up the 'snake' path and then down to the bottom of the horseshoe path. I was only out for 45 minutes and Angela was home when I got back.</p>
        <p>I was expecting a Eurotherm group chat at five, but then I realised that I hadn't received an invite. It seems that Colin had been in hospital, only returning home today, and so has organised a meeting for next Monday.</p>
