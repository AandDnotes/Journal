        <h1>Friday 8th October</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was predicting a a dry day, with cloud clearing after lunch and warm for the time of year. It drizzled for most of the morning, stayed cloudy all day and the ground only dried later in the afternoon. Therefore my plans to test drive the TC were thwarted. After talking with Dad I refitted the front wheels (after greasing the hub splines), adjusted the brakes and lowered the car to the ground. Later I remembered to fit the front number plate. I also put the battery on charge. Otherwise it was a case of tidying up the bench.</p>
        <p>So most of the afternoon was spent reading, until I had a video call with another person who is interested in joining our IET Sussex committee.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers and continued making a cushion cover.</p>
