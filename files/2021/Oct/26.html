        <h1>Tuesday 26th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off fairly early to help clear out a cupboard at the church, but was home earlier than she thought. While she was out I received the first of three parcels, this one delivered by the postman. It turned out to be a wireless charging pad. Just after twelve another two parcels were delivered by DPD. This time a mobile phone and a charging adapter.</p>
        <p>Whereas I had finished my 'pong' code before lunch, I spent most of my time after lunch setting up the new phone. I turned out to be an iPhone SE as an early Christmas present from the whole family. Setting it up took time (and is not yet finished), but was quite straight forward. It was soon connected to the wifi and my three email servers. Connecting to the iCloud updated the Address Book and Notes. Then I removed the SIM card from the old iPhone, pushed out the nano part and inserted in the new iPhone. When I started the phone it immediately connected to the network and now connects through wifi. More time was spent installing the applications that I had on the old phone.</p>
        <p>In the middle of this I updated the OS on the MacBook Air. It went from Big Sur to Monterey.</p>
        <p>After dinner it was time to attend the first IET Sussex talk of the new season (what should have been the first was cancelled).</p>
