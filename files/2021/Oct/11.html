        <h1>Monday 11th October</h1>
        <p>A quieter day, at least for me. Angela went to her 'exercise' group in the morning and to her WI committee meeting in the afternoon. Meanwhile, I spent some time tracking down a payment into our Barclays account that was on the statement that arrived this morning. It was the interest from one of our bonds that is paid into into the bank rather than added to the bond. After that I started working on my web page describing the replacement of the Kingpins.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. There was a good turn-out.</p>
