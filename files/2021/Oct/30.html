        <h1>Saturday 30th October</h1>
        <p>It was raining heavily when we got. There was a brief pause and then more rain. So we dressed in our waterproof trousers to go to the High Street to buy a newspaper. It had stopped raining by the time we left and it was fine for the rest of the day! In fact, the afternoon was quite sunny.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was spent reading the paper and doing the weekly accounts. Later, while Angela was working int he garden, I completed the new page in my notebook and emailed Rowan and Austin. They may not be interested enough to look at it.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria. She had spoken to the teachers of both Austin and Juniper. Juniper's reading is behind where it should be and Austin has difficulty with maintaining attention and with writing. He still doesn't use capital letters or full stops, often omits spaces between words and cannot form his letters properly or keep to lines. Juniper is to get some extra help with her reading and Austin is to be assessed to see if it is motor skills or something else. He does well in other subjects and enjoys reading. If he is feeling stressed he just makes noises rather than talking.</p>
