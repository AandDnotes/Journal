        <h1>Tuesday 5th October</h1>
        <p>It was a slightly earlier start this morning as I took the Panda to Sims by 8:30 for its service and MoT test. Then a walk home. Angela found that she couldn't open the garden store! So I spent some time counteracting the wood swelling. If it swells more then it will need more severe surgery.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning and part of the afternoon was spent filing down the diameter of the front hub spacers/washers. In between I added a washer to each cotter pin to allow the ends of the pin to protrude slightly out of the axle and prevent the small nut tightening against the shoulder of the pin. Towards the end of the day I put the off-side hub on (after adding some grease to the bearings), tapping it on using the spark plug socket and then winding it on using the castle nut. Now I just need to torque it up to 120 ft.lbf!</p>
