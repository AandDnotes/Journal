        <h1>Sunday 17th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church and then had a church meeting, so she didn't get home until about two o'clock. After sending a few IET email I went into the garage to continue making a new cotter pin shim. Later I put the front of the TC on axle stands and removed the near-side cotter pin, along with the shim. After 80 miles, the shim was only slightly marked.</p>
        <p>Today we spoke with both Paul and Victoria. Rowan is on half-term holiday for the next week and Victoria, Austin and Juniper had arrived back from a weekend camping. They got very wet, but seemed to enjoy themselves. However, the children were being very unruly.</p>
