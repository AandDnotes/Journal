        <h1>Monday 18th October</h1>
        <p>A busy day for both of us. In fact, Angela is still sorting out the money from her WI meeting this afternoon. Their speaker was Fran F-B.</p>
        <p>Angela left the house just before me this morning to go to her 'exercise' group. I then set off to the Knepp estate to meet up with the Eurotherm walking group. Four of the seven did not follow (or even read) Martin's instructions and went to the wrong car park. So Simon K and I had a coffee while Martin rounded them up. We then had a good six and a half mile walk, going past Shipley mill and the ruins of the old Knepp castle (I took photos of both). We only saw cattle and a solitary pig, apart from some ducks on the lake. It started to spit with rain just as we got back to our cars, so we went to the Countryman pub for a drink and more chat before coming home. It was raining steadily by then and I arrived just before four, as Angela was approaching our house.</p>
