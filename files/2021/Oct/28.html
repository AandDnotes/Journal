        <h1>Thursday 28th October</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We were not very early, but we went off to Holmebush to do the weekly shop at Tesco. This was because Angela wanted to go to M&S to look for a cardigan and a coat. So after the groceries shop we had coffee and then browsed around the shop. Angela only bought a few pairs of socks and the Â£5 voucher that she had, even though it was for clothing, didn't work!</p>
        <p>We got home just in time to have lunch while we watched the news. After that, Angela cut the grass and I delved into the NHS app. I verified my details by photographing the main page of my passport and then videoing me saying a four digit  code that the app provided. A couple of hours later I received an email saying that my registration was complete and I accessed my Covid-19 records. So then I registered Angela. This time the app verified the photo of her passport by scanning her face and it only took a few minutes for her registration to complete.</p>
        <p>My other activity was to video the MacBook while I played my 'pong' game. I created a lower resolution version that I will add to my 'notebook'.</p>
