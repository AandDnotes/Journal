        <h1>Sunday 10th October</h1>
        <p>As Angela left to go to church, I was emailing Invensys Pensions to request that they don't send me two copies of their Pension News each time. Then I went into the garage. I lifted the front of the car and checked the tightness of the nuts around each stub axle. Then I discovered that the near-side damper was loose! That explains the clattering noise that I heard yesterday when out for a test run. I also checked the tyre pressures and dipped the tank. So now it should be ready for the Sussex Wanderers run on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I cleared a few weeds from the drive, also giving it a sweep. The sun finally came out, after a very cloudy day. Then we spoke to Paul and Rowan.</p>
