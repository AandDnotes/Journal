        <h1>Wednesday 20th October</h1>
        <p>We were up late this morning and so by the time we had eaten breakfast and showered it was after ten. Angela did her Dutch before lunch so that she could go off to her table tennis. Meanwhile, I spent a lot of the day drafting my October newsletter. Our talk this month is a week later than usual, so that makes the timing more difficult. So I drafted the rest and got it sent to Greg. I also emailed Julie to warn her that we were short of review/approval time. I also told her about a problem with the colour options on a couple of sections and a lack of a registration link on one of the November talks.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her table tennis club.</p>
