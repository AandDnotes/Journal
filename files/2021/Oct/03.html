        <h1>Sunday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I arranged a call with another prospective committee member and then went into the garage to continue filing down the 'shim' for the cotter pin. The shim was sharp and a small cut on my thumb was a problem. However, I made another jig so that I could file the shim more easily. Originally I thought that the shim needed to be about 1mm thick, but it ended up being 20 thou at the thick end and practically zero at the other before the cotter would go all the way in. So later, after talking with Paul, I finished fitting the near-side stub axle, having adjusted the shims above the axle.</p>
        <p>It was mainly dry and sunny for part of the time, but we had a couple of showers. During one, Angela found that the door of the garden store would not close. It seems to have swollen with the rain. So, between showers, I removed the cover strips and planed off some wood until the doors would close.</p>
