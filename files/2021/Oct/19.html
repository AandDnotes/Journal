        <h1>Tuesday 19th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went out before I was dressed this morning. Admittedly we were a little late getting up this morning, but she caught the bus to Storrington to pay in her WI and lunch club cash. I dealt with a few IET email and then went into the garage to continue working on the kingpin shim. I finished filing it down to 15 thou along it length, when it looked as though it was going to fit. I heated it to cherry red (at least the middle) and quenched it to harden it. Then I fitted the cotter pin with shim and it all looks much better.</p>
        <p>After lunch I helped Angela remove some compost from the hot bin and then checked the tightness of the bolts on the near-side front damper and then lowered the car to the ground. She continued to work in the garden and later I updated the web page about the kingpin replacement.</p>
