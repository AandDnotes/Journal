        <h1>Saturday 16th October</h1>
        <p>From the weather forecast we didn't think it would drizzle and rain for much of the day. We set off this morning to the High street to buy a newspaper and some rolls and came home via the lower horseshoe path. It drizzled on and off for a lot of the way back and then rained heavily after we got home.</p>
        <p>After reading some of the paper, I replied to my ESA man, forwarded details of his talk to Dave and replied to Marnie Middlemiss at Brighton about meeting for a chat, before doing the weekly accounts. I had to leave the reconciliation against the bank statement until after lunch, so it was quite late before I got into the garage. There, I started cutting up the remains of an old bolt to make a slightly thicker shim for the TC's near-side cotter pin.</p>
        <p>Angela did some more to her patchwork cushion cover.</p>
