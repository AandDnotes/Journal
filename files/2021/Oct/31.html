        <h1>Sunday 31st October</h1>
        <p>Luckily it stopped raining just as Angela set off for church and only started again as she was nearly home. I then spent most of the morning doing the monthly accounts. I also started looking at why my home page behaves differently on different devices. Later I worked out what was going wrong with my web page, so now it works as I want on the iPhone as well a the MacBook.</p>
        <p>Although Angela went out to clear some leaves, it was really a day to stay inside. It was windy and chilly. So I finished drafting my article on kingpins. It really needs making more humorous.</p>
        <p>At afternoon tea time we spoke with Paul and at least said hello to Rowan.</p>
