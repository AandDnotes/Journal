        <h1>Wednesday 6th October</h1>
        <p>It was another early start. Two in consecutive days is too much. Angela set off just before nine to pick up a friend and then go to the Baptist church in Angmering for a Women's World Day of Prayer event. She arrived home at 3:30 in the afternoon. Luckily it was a fine, sunny day; if initially a little windy.</p>
        <p>After sending an email with links to IET volunteer policy documents to the Sussex committee members, I went into the garage. Firstly I torqued the off-side hub nut to 120 ft.lbf (that is a right-hand tread, so the torque wrench would 'click'). Then I greased and fitted the near-side hub. Since it is a left-hand tread I tightened the nut as much as I could, aligning the castle nut with the hole in the spindle for the split pin.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started relining the front brake shoes. As far as I can work out, the linings from NTG are woven. This could be from organic material, such as from coconut shells or from Aramid fibre (which is the same as Kevlar). They also have short threads of brass in them. The only sources of information I can find are on the <a href="https://www.par-group.co.uk/high-temperature-insulation/brake-lining-materials/">PAR</a> site and the <a href="https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2013/08/30/tech-101-how-to-choose-the-right-brake-friction-material">Hemmings</a> site.</p>
        <p>I managed to reline two of the four shoes, although the rivets don't seem to 'roll' as I had expected. I also found out why one shoe has some extra rivet holes. One of the rivets is almost under the return spring lug. I modified a nail and was able to spread and flatten the rivet.</p>
