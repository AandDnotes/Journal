        <h1>Monday 4th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street and then to her 'exercise' session, I went in the garage. During the morning I enlarged the holes in the kingpin caps to take the larger bolts and then fitted the caps and felt washers, with some grease. I then cleaned up the bolts and managed to fit the near-side brake backplate.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela worked on her WI accounts and I fitted the off-side backplate. I had to file the nuts on the long bolts so as to get them to engage with the thread on the bolt. Then I put grease into each kingpin via the grease nipples. It went in easily, but I was surprised that it came out the bottom.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I joined the Eurotherm group Zoom meeting.</p>
