        <h1>Sunday 24th October</h1>
        <p>It was a pretty standard Sunday. Angela went to church while I moved money into Dad's account and modified my newsletter after receiving comments from Greg.</p>
        <p>Angela prepared her lunch club accounts and took them around to Linda. I added a little more to my article on kingpin replacement and we also did quite a bit of newspaper reading. Later in the day we had a FaceTime call with Paul.</p>
