        <h1>Friday 1st October</h1>
        <p>Although my aim was to progress the work on the stub axles, it was after midday before I got in the garage. Before that I reviewed the 'due diligence' document from the GOG, which took longer than I expected. Having received a call from David Farrer-Brown about the next Sussex Wanderers outing I emailed my choice of meal, etc. to David Griffiths.</p>
        <p>I also created a web page (part of my 'important' group) outlining how I deal with Dad's finances. After dinner in the evening I phoned Alan and sent him the link.</p>
        <p>In the garage I finished preparing my cotter 'shim' and tried silver soldering it to an old cotter pin. That didn't work. I tried again later in the day, having thoroughly cleaned the surfaces, but again it didn't work. I can only assume that I could not get the pin hot enough to melt the solder. So rather than file down the combined cotter pin and shim, I decided to filed the shim to shape, with the intent of trying to fit the two together.</p>
