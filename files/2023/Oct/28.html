        <h1>Saturday 28th October</h1>
        <p>It started off wet, so I dressed up and walked to the High Street to by a paper before having a shower. The rest of the morning was then spent doing the weekly accounts and clearing the front gutters. We'd had a lot of heavy rain and the moss had been washed into the gutters and was blocking the 'balloons' over the top of the down-pipes.</p>
        <p>We set off just before two on our way to Chris and Alan's. Traffic was stop/start around Heathrow, but we made quite good time, getting there just after 4:30. Their house was decorated for Halloween (it took them two days to do it) and it was impossible to identify some people who were wearing a costume and a mask. Some (including Alan and Chris) were in costume, wigs and grease paint!</p>
        <p>It was one in the morning before we got to bed and some were still up. When we came down for breakfast at nine, everything from the evening before (food, glasses, plates, etc.) had been cleared away.</p>
