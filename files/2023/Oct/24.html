        <h1>Tuesday 24th October</h1>
        <p>A day spent recovering from the exertions of yesterday. I didn't go out, although Angela went down to the High Street to buy a few things for a chicken stir fry.</p>
        <p>We spent time in the morning and then again after lunch trying to talk to someone at the HMRC about the yearly letter that says Angela owes them Â£73. We gave up waiting on the phone in the morning (it was approaching one hour) and in the afternoon, after all the 'chatter' and options selection, they said they couldn't take a call and said goodbye! So Angela paid the amount and will see what happens next year.</p>
        <p>While waiting on the phone I added notes to the IET Sussex Notebook entry on the Control Technologies workshop equipment and future options. Otherwise, I checked what engine oil I had (a part 5l can) and ordered some more from Halfords. I also investigated the time clock that does not work. The cell battery is only showing .9V rather than 1.5, so I assume that is the problem. The screws to open it are of a type that I've not seen before and so for which I have no bit. I also looked at what the Greenwich museums and the Thames cable car had to offer (for the next London walk) and started investigating installation of the Lego RCX drivers to the CoCo software.</p>
