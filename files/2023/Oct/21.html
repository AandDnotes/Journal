        <h1>Saturday 21st October</h1>
        <p>Luckily it wasn't raining when we walked down to the High Street to get a newspaper, rolls and tomatoes. Later I did the weekly accounts. Then I bought my rail ticket for Monday and booked a spot in the Shoreham station car park. I also said that I was interested in helping at a STEM event at the Amex stadium in November.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. Then I installed the UTM virtual machine software, installed Windows 11 on it and then installed the CoCo software. All this took some time, requiring me to uninstall it all and start again.</p>
