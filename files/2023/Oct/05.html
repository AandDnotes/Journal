        <h1>Thursday 5th October</h1>
        <p>The British Heart Foundation said they would collect our Z-bed between eight and one today, although the BHF lady who phoned said to expect them earlier rather than later. They arrived at about 10:30, although they didn't want the books. So we then went into Worthing, did most of our grocery shop, had some lunch in the Waitrose cafe and then called into Lyons Farm to get a couple of things we couldn't find, a small paper shredder from PC World and some plants from B&amp;Q. We got home at about three.</p>
        <p>Angela then 'pottered' in the garden and I put together the recoding of Tuesday's talk. I had earlier run all the files through Handbrake so as to make them run. I created a title frame, added a 'Thank you for watching' end and increased the sound level for each of the questions. Overall it doesn't look too bad.</p>
