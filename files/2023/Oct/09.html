        <h1>Monday 9th October</h1>
        <p>Today was 'lunch club' day, so, although she wasn't cooking, Angela went down to the church to check that the cook and helpers had everything they needed. She went back later to help set up and I went down just before lunch was to be served. I stayed, as usual, to help clear up. They were short of helpers to clear up. We were back at about three o'clock.</p>
        <p>Before I went down to the church I tested the second traffic light model and the other control boxes. All were fine. Later in the day we both went off in the TC to the MG club meeting in Washington. We had to use the headlights on the way there, as well as on the way home, although we had the roof down both ways.</p>
