        <h1>Monday 9th October</h1>
        <p>Today was 'lunch club' day, so, although she wasn't cooking, Angela went down to the church to check that the cook and helpers had everything they needed. She went back later to help set up and I went down just before lunch was to be served. I stayed, as usual, to help clear up. They were short of helpers to clear up. We were back at about three o'clock.</p>
        <p>At the lunch club, John Hollington gave me the card of someone he had met that morning  who said he might be interested in the TC. I phone him during the afternoon. He is 85, already has a TD, but thought that my asking price was a bit high. I gave him the web page address and my phone number. </p>
        <p>I also phoned the RAC about the 30% increase in membership fee. The increase was reduced to only Â£6 more than last year and will be kept the same next year!</p>
        <p>Before I went down to the church I tested the second traffic light model and the other control boxes. All were fine. Later in the day we both went off in the TC to the MG club meeting in Washington. We had to use the headlights on the way there, as well as on the way home, although we had the roof down both ways.</p>
