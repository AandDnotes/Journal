        <h1>Thursday 26th October</h1>
        <p>A more productive day that started wet, but turned into a warm, sunny morning/afternoon, with a shower or two later.</p>
        <p>We went into Worthing and Angela bought a pair of general purpose boots. We then went on to have coffee at Waitrose and do the weekly shop. On the way home we called into B&amp;Q to buy some plants that Angela lated planted into a bowl. These are to take to Chris and Alan's on Saturday, along with some biscuits.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drained the oil from the TC's engine and replaced the filter. I will need to use an empty 1l oil bottle to measure out the new oil. I also checked the Panda's tyre pressures. The must have all been set to the same pressure when it was serviced.</p>
