        <h1>Saturday 14th October</h1>
        <p>After walking to the High Street to get a newspaper I spent most of the morning trying to get the CoCo software 'packaged' by Wineskin. All seemed to be going well. The installation program opened, but would not accept the key. It looks as though there might be a dll missing.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden for most of the day. After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe, where I mainly fixed cut wires.</p>
