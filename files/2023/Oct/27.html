        <h1>Friday 27th October</h1>
        <p>Another busy day and quite a wet one. There was, however, some sunshine, but the showers were heavy.</p>
        <p>Angela was collected at nine o'clock and taken off to Crowborough for a meeting about the next World day of Prayer. She arrived home at 4:30. I started by phoning the secretary at the health centre about my referral to the physio. She took some time to investigate and will try to sort it out with the physios in Bognor. I suspect they they (the health centre) forgot to send it.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time in the garage. Firstly I filled the TC's engine with oil, having to measure it out, litre by litre. Then I drained the coolant. I found that the fitting on the old fuel pipe would fit the tap on the radiator, which prevented it squirting out, draining it into a bowl. I also opened the tap on the block and put a 33% solution of antifreeze back. Again I had to use an empty one litre container to measure out the quantities. I ran the engine for a while and all seems well, but I will need to take it for a test run.</p>
