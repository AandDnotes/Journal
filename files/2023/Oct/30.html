        <h1>Monday 30th October</h1>
        <p>Not a good day! I succumbed to a scam. At lunchtime I had a phone call from someone saying they were the publishers of the Octagon Club magazine and that they had space for an advert for my car. I hesitated but then said yes and gave them my credit card details. Later I had another call from someone purporting to be from mbna, questioning a bill that was much larger than expected. They said they would cancel my card and block the payment. A little later they called again to say that there were other payments, saying that I would receive a text message with a code that they needed to confirm that I wanted to block the payment. I should have read the whole text. Later still I called mbna to find that they were all scam calls. By giving them the code I had allowed them to confirm the payment! mbna fraud department asked lots of questions and investigated the transactions. Eventually they said they would refund the Â£900 that had been taken.</p>
        <p>Early on, Angela went to her Monday meeting while I emailed Clive about the Battersea power station visit and renewed a bond. After dinner I joined an IET Sussex Teams call on events.</p>
