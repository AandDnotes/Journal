        <h1>Sunday 15th October</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but chilly day. Angela went off to church as usual and I spent a lot of the morning trying to find out why the CoCo installation software when run under WineSkin would not recognise the 'serial key'. It looked as though the the winecfg executable would not run because there was a reference to the wrong cpu type. I couldn't find a solution, so I started researching using a virtual machine.</p>
        <p>I decided to try UTM, so started by downloading the Windows 11 ISO image (using CrystalFetch). Apparently Windows 10 does not work in a VM with M1 processor.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria. Austin had been on a scout camp, but it was so wet that they decided to come home early. They now had to dry out his clothes and tent. Brandon's company seems to be in a bad way. Last week they laid off half the staff, including Brandon's boss. It seems that they were putting all their venture capital and effort into expanding (setting up another farm) whereas they were not making any money from their existing ventures. He is not very optimistic.</p>
        <p>Also spoke with Paul. Earlier I had checked possible travel plans to go there for Christmas. Going via London City Airport (to Rotterdam) is only half the price of going via Eurostar. Later I spoke with Alan. At the end of the month we can stay with them on the Saturday night, but not on Sunday.</p>
