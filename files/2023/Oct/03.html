        <h1>Tuesday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street, I created a speaker certificate for this evening's IET talk. In fact, most of my day seemed to be associated with this event. I downloaded the attendance list and printed it in case Mike can't do it (Mike U is the convenor tonight).</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove to Crawley to the talk. It was reasonably interesting and we had over thirty people attending (even though 51 registered). However, I had difficulty getting home, I guess missing a diversion at Pease Pottage intersection and ended up on the M23 heading north! I had to drive to Gatwick to turn around and head south.</p>
        <p>In between work on and attendance at the talk I explored another of the Control Technology boxes. It was full of Lego equipment, including a number of the first generation Mindstorms controllers. These are no longer supported and it may not be possible to get them working.</p>
