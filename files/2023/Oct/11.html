        <h1>Wednesday 11th October</h1>
        <p>A dry, but mainly overcast and warm day. I was up early so that I could drive over to David F-B's (in the Panda). The TF that he was planning to take on the Sussex Wanderers run would not start (flat battery), so we took his Rover P6. Thus we had a comfortable ride to West Dean to meet up with the others and to have coffee.</p>
        <p>The run was good, although some roads were only single track. When a line of us met an oncoming bin lorry, seven of us had to revers down the hill and into a field to let it past. It then had to deal with another convoy further down the hill. Then there was a road closure, but the first car there turned back and directed the rest of us to go on the other two sides of a triangle.</p>
        <p>We arrived at the pub in Midhurst and were all sat in a large marquee, which was good, but the meals took quite a time to arrive. However, they all seemed good. Certainly my ploughman's was almost too much to eat.</p>
        <p>I arrived home just before four and put the hood up on the TC (and covered it). The brought in the washing after a few spots of rain. Angela got home from table tennis at about half past.</p>
