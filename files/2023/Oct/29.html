        <h1>Sunday 29th October</h1>
        <p>After quite a good night's sleep we woke up at 7:30. We then got up at 8:30 and were down for breakfast at nine. Surprisingly, all the clearing up had been done and Alan was cooking bacon. Shortly after others arrived and the 'first shift' (seven of us excluding Chris and Alan) had breakfast. Just as we were finishing, so the 'second shift' arrived. Laura and the two boys, Richard, with Eva and Teddy.</p>
        <p>We left at 10:30, just before Gabriel arrived, as part of the 'third shift'. There was a lot of rain on the M1 and M25. I was concentrating so much that I missed the M25 turn and we had to go down to the next M1 turn-off. WE had quite a lot of hold-up, although none were too long. We stopped at Denbighs for lunch and a look around the art exhibition. We got home at about 2:30.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria and then with Paul.</p>
