        <h1>Friday 20th October</h1>
        <p>A tiring day. Luckily the weather forecast gradually improved as we got closer to the day. Angela was planning to meet her school friends, Carole and June in Guildford. I went with Angela to help support her driving to Guildford. She drove there and I drove back.</p>
        <p>We met June and her husband, Chris in the Park &amp; Ride car park and Carole at Guildford bus station. Chris went off walking and the rest of us had a coffee before I went off. I walked along the River Wey, past Dapdune Wharf, for about 45 minutes before turning back. I was very weary when I got back to Guildford centre, where I went into M&amp;S for some lunch.</p>
        <p>We all met to catch the four o'clock bus back to the car park. We got home just after 5:30, feeling very tired. Luckily the rain held off, apart from a little rain around Horsham.</p>
