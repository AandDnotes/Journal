        <h1>Tuesday 17th October</h1>
        <p>For me it seems to have been an IET day. And it was another sunny, but chilly day, so I had little encouragement to go outside. I spent the morning collecting some images of the Control Technologies kit and putting them on into the Sussex Notebook (OneNote). I then started adding some text.</p>
        <p>Since there was an IET talk this evening, I spent time downloading the attendance list and creating a speaker certificate. Angela pottered in the garden for a while.</p>
        <p>So I went off to Falmer, armed with the video camera. The talk was titled "Can we trust ChatGPT?". Basically the answer is no. However, we had about 60 attendees and it was a good, wide ranging talk, covering the history of Large Language Models as well as the good points and bad points about ChatGPT and other LLMs.</p>
