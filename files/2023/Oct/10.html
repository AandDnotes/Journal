        <h1>Tuesday 10th October</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and probably our last dry one for a while. I was up early and took the Panda to Simms for a service and an MoT test. I was able to collect it just before lunch so I didn't need to take the TC to Field Place for the RCEA talk.</p>
        <p>That talk was given by Mike Underhill, mainly on the magnatron. His slides are more like lecture notes (lots of words) and those with a mechanical background found it difficult going.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I started doing some research on how I could run a Windows programme on the Mac. The alternative seems to be running the program under Wine or installing a virtual machine with Windows.</p>
