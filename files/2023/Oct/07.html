        <h1>Saturday 7th October</h1>
        <p>I had an early start, needing to be at the health centre by 8:30 for my flu jab. I bought a newspaper on the way back.</p>
        <p>Angela worked hard in the garden, planting up pots for the winter. I did the weekly and then the monthly accounts, which took me most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, which seemed to take up most of the afternoon. We did spend a little time researching hearing aids, the expensive kind.</p>
