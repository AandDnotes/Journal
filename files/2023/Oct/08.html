        <h1>Sunday 8th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I checked over the cars and then set about testing each of the CoCo models. During the day I tested the Clown, House and one of the traffic lights. All seems to be working well.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the grass, front and back. Later we spoke with Paul.</p>
