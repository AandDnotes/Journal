        <h1>Sunday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church this morning and didn't get home until about five o'clock. She stayed for lunch and for a committee meeting.</p>
        <p>I tested the MacBook installation of UTM/Windows/CoCo with a CoCo control box. It worked. Later I looked at buying Alan some wine for his birthday and oil for the TC.</p>
        <p>Later still, we spoke with Paul.</p>
