        <h1>Sunday 1st October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went off to church (with cake) while I took the paper shredder apart and cleaned out the inside. It isn't cutting properly, so I oiled it my putting sunflower oil on a sheet of paper and shredding it. I followed that with a plain sheet, but it still seems to creasing rather than cutting. It is over 30 years old, so the cutting disks have probably worn.</p>
        <p>I also copied all the CoCo installation CD files to a folder on OneDrive on our IET Sussex Office 365 site. And then I started writing a readMe file to explain what has to be done to install the software.</p>
        <p>Later, as usual on a Sunday, we spoke with Paul. After dinner we watched Hamlet with David Tennant in the lead.</p>
