        <h1>Wednesday 18th October</h1>
        <p>A cold, wet and windy day. It was so bad that Angela resorted to taking the car to her table tennis meeting.</p>
        <p>I didn't go out. I started by downloading the video files of yesterday's talk from the camera SD card and then spent some time adding some notes about the Controls Technologies workshop. I had to do some research to find when the Lego RCX controllers were manufactured.</p>
        <p>The video files would not run in QuickTime, so I ran them through Handbrake, which enabled them to play. Later I loaded them into iMovie added a title and end slide and removed clips from the beginning and end. I also had to increase the sound volume throughout and more so for the questions. I then ran the export through Handbrake to reduce the size from 13GB to 2.2GB.</p>
