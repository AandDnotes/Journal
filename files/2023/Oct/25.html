        <h1>Wednesday 25th October</h1>
        <p>I tried to install the driver for the Lego Tower, but without success. Windows (in the VM) recognised the device, but had no driver.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to table tennis, I went to the pharmacy for my repeat prescription. I also asked in the health centre about my referral to the physiotherapist. They confirmed that the referral had been sent and gave me the number of the physios (in Bognor). They say that they have not received a referral!. It seems that I need to speak to one of the secretaries at the health centre.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Devil's Dyke Hotel to meet up with members of the IET Sussex committee.</p>
