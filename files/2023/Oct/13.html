        <h1>Friday 13th October</h1>
        <p>The day started with rain and ended with rain, but was dry and quite mild in the middle. This meant that Angela could go to the butchers without getting wet and spent a lot of the day int he garden or garage potting up.</p>
        <p>Apart from collecting my tools together for tomorrow's Repair Cafe, I spent a lot of the day trying to get a Windows 32-bit application to run on the iMac. I finished installing Wine, but it just gave a lot of errors when I tried to run the CoCo install program. Later in the day I discovered Wineskin Winery, which uses Wine to package up an application (even a 32-bit one) to look like a Mac OS app. I've installed it, but haven't yet tried to 'package' CoCo.</p>
