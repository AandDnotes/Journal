        <h1>Tuesday 31st October</h1>
        <p>A much quieter day. The most excitement was going for a haircut. I paid Clive for the 'lift' part of the Battersea Power Station visit and completed the transcription of my notes on my first trip to India, together with scanning photos of the Taj Mahal and Fatipur Sikri.</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went to the dentist (and hygienist) and in the afternoon got her WI bank account closure form signed. Later in the day I had my hair cut in the High Street. Luckily I got home just before it started raining.</p>
