        <h1>Monday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went off to her Monday group as usual and I went off to Mike W's to collect the Control Technologies equipment. Actually we sat and chatted while drinking coffee before going to one of his sheds (the woodworking shed) to retrieve the four boxes. I had thought that there were only two. When I got home I vacuumed the sawdust off the boxes before bringing them inside.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went through two of the boxes, vacuuming them out and removing all the batteries. The first box was the CoCo models, but the second contained lots of Lego bits (plus some torches). Angela cut the front grass.</p>
