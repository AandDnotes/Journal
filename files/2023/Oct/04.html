        <h1>Wednesday 4th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch, but my day revolved around IET related things.</p>
        <p>I transferred the video files (five) from the camera's memory card to the iMac via the MacBook. However, I discovered that they would not run in Quicktime. The sound was fine, but the video only showed a a still image. I imported a file into iMovie. The file would play, but every now and then it would flash and then go blank for a few seconds. Luckily I found that running each file through Handbrake produced files that would play.</p>
        <p>In parallel I examined the the final Control Technology box. This contained the BeeBots and the CoCo interface blocks. I checked each of the BeeBots, removing their batteries, some of which were dead. I found that one BeeBot would not turn its wheels. I took it apart, but to get at the screws holding the gearing in place it would be necessary to unsolder eight connections on the PCB. I also connected one of the interface boxes to the old laptop and tested a switch, a lamp, a thermometer and a motor.</p>
