        <h1>Monday 16th October</h1>
        <p>Another sunny, but chilly day. However, it was much more successful for getting CoCo working on the iMac. I downloaded an ISO image for Windows 11, then installed UTM (virtual machine) and installed Windows. Then I installed CoCo. Not only does it work, but it also connects to the controller via USB.</p>
        <p>While I was doing this, Angela went to to her Monday women's group meeting. Then she 'pottered' in the garden while I uninstalled all the Wine related software from the iMac.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined a sub-team meeting on STEM. I have a number of actions!</p>
