        <h1>Monday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>'London Walk' day. I was at Shoreham station 20 minutes early for the train to Victoria. There were eight of us. After coffee we got to the northern end of the tunnel under the Thames via tube and DLR. At Greenwich we stopped to have lunch before setting off on the rest of the walk. We returned to Greenwich pier and caught the boat to Westminster pier, then walked to the 'pie pub' and from there back to Victoria.</p>
        <p>I arrived home just before 9:30.</p>
