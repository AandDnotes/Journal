        <h1>Thursday 19th October</h1>
        <p>I note again that my journal is, in fact, little more than a list of things that we have done. That, in itself, can be quite useful if I need to find out when we did something, but the journal should be a little deeper than that.</p>
        <p>So, what did we do today? Thursday is our usual day for doing the weekly shop, so we went off to Lyons Farm this morning. From there we drove up the A24 and turned off to the Big Plant nursery for coffee. As usually happens, that took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>Angela received a letter from the HMRC saying that she had underpaid her tax by Â£73 for 2022/23. Exactly the same amount as was asked for last year and the past four years. Angela wrote to them last year asking why, but got no reply and didn't pay it. We tried logging in to her personal tax account, but it only gave generic statements. Phoning said they were very busy, as usual. So we will call them next week.</p>
        <p>I produced the next Adestra email to advertise the next two talks and submitted it for approval. I also sent it to Mark and Dave. Then I uploaded the recording of Tuesday's talk to our YouTube channel and emailed Deshinder and Professor Weeds (the speaker). I also uploaded a pdf version of her slides to our home page, along with a few other edits. This included making the next version of the 2023/24 talks programme and replacing the previous version on our home page.</p>
