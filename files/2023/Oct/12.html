        <h1>Thursday 12th October</h1>
        <p>A grey day, but still reasonably warm. We started by going to Waitrose to do the weekly shop. After coffee we went to B&amp;Q to look for some more plants. But they didn't have any good ones, so we went to Squires. Unfortunately there were road works on the A27 and so it was nose-to-tail for a lot of the way. However, we were home just in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>Angela then worked int he garden planting troughs and pots. I sent Roger a short article on MoT testing (which may be too similar to one that I wrote in 2021). Although I updated my main (aanddnotes) site, but Github Pages failed to update my DJsMGs site.</p>
        <p>I took the first step towards installing Wine on the iMac. I installed Homebrew, along with the apps needed to install it.</p>
