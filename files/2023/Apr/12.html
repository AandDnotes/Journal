        <h1>Wednesday 12th April</h1>
        <p>The day started bright, but the forecast was bad. Angela went off first with her WI walking group and then David F-B picked me up in his TR4A at about 10:45 to go on the Wanderers run. We went to Ashington for coffee and then took a route that I knew to Shoreham for lunch.</p>
        <p>David and I sat with three others from the Chichester club. The company was good, but the meal was only OK. We left relatively early, so I was home about three.</p>
        <p>I made good progress on my image conversion code.</p>
