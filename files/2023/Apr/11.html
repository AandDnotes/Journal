        <h1>Tuesday 11th April</h1>
        <p>The day started sunny, but clouded over during the morning and was raining by lunchtime.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning in the garage, putting wax on the TC (the parts that I didn't do yesterday). Angela went to the High Street and to the library.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA talk at Field Place, getting home just before five. After dinner Angela went to the Methodist church to make teas for a talk that was taking place there. I worked on my python project.</p>
