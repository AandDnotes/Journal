        <h1>Monday 10th April</h1>
        <p>A wet Easter Monday morning. So we stayed inside. Angela did some cleaning and I bought our travel insurance, at an enormous cost, in spite of a 12% discount. I also uploaded the recording of the last talk to YouTube.</p>
        <p>Later, once the rain had stopped, we walked to the High Street so that I could deliver a repeat prescription request to the Health Centre and we could buy a few things in the Coop. We were expecting today's milk to be delivered on Friday. But it wasn't.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I spent half an hour in the garage putting some wax on the TC. I only did the bonnet and the front wings.</p>
