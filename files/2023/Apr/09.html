        <h1>Sunday 9th April</h1>
        <p>Easter Sunday. Angela went to church as usual and I spent a lot of the day in the garage, mainly cleaning the TC. A wipe over with a very dilute washing-up liquid and some CIF on oily deposits. However, I started by removing dried leaves and sycamore seeds from the floor and replaced the cardboard under the car.</p>
        <p>I found that the US Homeland Security have taken our money, so they must have approved our ESTAs. Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They were sat outside in the sun.</p>
