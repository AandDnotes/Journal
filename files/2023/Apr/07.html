        <h1>Friday 7th April</h1>
        <p>Good Friday, although it is difficult to remember what day it is. However, it was sunny for most of the day. I started by setting off the compression of the video recording of Tuesday's talk, which took quite a time.</p>
        <p>Angela helped Sandi tidy up the Methodist Church garden, both before and after lunch. I started by exploring travel insurance options and then spent the morning and part of the afternoon trying to book our flights and hotel. When I say trying, it was trying. The Iceland Air website kept throwing up errors and then wouldn't accept my credit card! I phoned them and a lady with a strong accent took my card details and linked it to the details I'd entered online. Then I got an email to say that the card had not been accepted! So I phoned mbna, who, I found, had blocked my card, thinking that it was a fraudulent transaction. It would have helped if they had told me.</p>
        <p>So eventually I managed to book the flights and then the hotel. The travel insurance is going to be very expensive; almost as much as three nights for two in a central Boston hotel. By the end, Angela was tired from her gardening and I was mentally exhausted.</p>
