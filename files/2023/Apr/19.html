        <h1>Wednesday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Angela's 75th birthday. And generally quite a nice day, warmer than yesterday, if a little breezy.</p>
        <p>Angela spent most of the morning walking with the WI group. I thanked yesterday's speaker, asked Kosininna to email the committee about helping to produce the newsletter and responded to an email from Julie about links to documents in my events programme page not working. It looks to me like a problem with EngX. I also reworked my diagram about our web pages to bring it up to date in preparation for the workshop in June.</p>
        <p>Later I removed the old light on the side of the garage. I had to temporarily remove the lid of the central bin store so as to reach the light.</p>
        <p>Angela had some flowers delivered from Paul et al, but didn't want to go out for a meal, so we just opened a bottle of wine.</p>
