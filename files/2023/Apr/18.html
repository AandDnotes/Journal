        <h1>Tuesday 18th April</h1>
        <p>A cloudier, colder day, which wasn't the best time to continue fitting the new outside light. It was fiddly, but I got it fitted to the wall by the front door. I could make it come on when I moved and so turned down the light sensitivity. When I got home in the evening, the light came on as I walked around from the garage. It gave a lot of light and turned off just after I got inside. I will need to test that it doesn't come on as you walk along the pavement.</p>
        <p>I phoned the pharmacy early and found that they were waiting for the tablets to be delivered. They had arrived after lunch, so I walked down to collect them. They were the right tablet, but the repeat prescription still said 40mg tablets, rather than 120mg. I phoned the prescription team and they will get permission from Dr Jain to change it.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I went to Falmer to convene the IET talk. It was a good talk, with a reasonable number of attendees.</p>
