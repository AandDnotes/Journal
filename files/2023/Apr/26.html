        <h1>Wednesday 26th April</h1>
        <p>Apparently it was Hamish's 75th birthday, or would have been, but it was also his funeral. Angela went off with her walking group, which seemed to involve walking to the Hub for coffee and then walking to the White Horse for lunch.</p>
        <p>Martin arrived just before one and Mike a few minutes later. By the time we got to Walberton the place was full of cars and we were of the last to get into the church. There must have been about 250 people! Afterwards most people went to the local pub. It was after five before we left.</p>
