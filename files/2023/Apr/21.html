        <h1>Friday 21st April</h1>
        <p>While Angela walked to the High Street I prepared and submitted the email to advertise the next IET talks, which took a lot of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went into the garden and I continued (and finished) cleaning the soffits, facias and downpipes around the house. I can only reach a little way up the end facias, but now need to tackle the garage.</p>
        <p>Angela wrote some numbers for me, which was useful, since her number 7 'broke' my program. I discovered that the 'centre of gravity' of the number's image was high enough to push the 20 pixel high image out of the 28x28 array. I tried using a physical centring, but that gave lots of errors, so I added some checks and corrections to the CofG method, which seem to work. However, the amount of light falling on the paper seems to be critical, so I increased the level at which pixels are set to zero.</p>
