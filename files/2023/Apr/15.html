        <h1>Saturday 15th April</h1>
        <p>A grey, not too warm morning turned into a sunny and warm afternoon. I walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and collect a prescription, while Angela went off to Tesco to buy mainly frozen chicken for Monday's lunch club. When I got home I discovered that the pharmacy had given me the 'three a day' tablets instead of the 'one a day'. I will need to call the prescription team on Monday (when I run out of the 'one a day' tablets). Then I finished off the things that I need for Tuesday's IET talk.</p>
        <p>Then, before lunch, did the weekly accounts and reconciled them against a bank statement. Meanwhile, Angela worked in the garden, as she did after lunch. I cut the front grass, fixed a piece of plastic netting to part of the wall in the walled garden (but it needs more cable pins to hold it firmly in place) and then made plastic mesh cylinders to go around our three 'whips' in the front.</p>
