        <h1>Friday 14th April</h1>
        <p>A pretty wet day. While Angela went to the butchers, I generated the start slide and speaker certificate for Tuesday's talk.</p>
        <p>I replied to Mike about a talk to the RCEA, offering a title and synopsis. Later I spent quite a lot of time generating images to use in a presentation. A lot of that time was spent on generating equations using an online LaTex editor, the text being pasted into Keynote.</p>
