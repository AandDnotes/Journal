        <h1>Tuesday 4th April</h1>
        <p>Another calm, sunny day, albeit a little chilly. We even had our morning coffee in the kitchen garden. I spent quite a lot of time looking at the details of a trip to New Jersey in June. Some of the web sites were really not easy to use and understand exactly what price was being charged for what. At the moment, Iceland Air is looking like the best bet, but more investigation is in order.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunch time, since I had an IET talk in Crawley in the evening. However, for some reason I had it in my head that I needed to leave home at a quarter to five. It should have been a quarter to six, so I was an hour early. I'd also had problems with the attendance sheet, since the Plus4Events web server was down. Then, when I tried to set up the video camera, it complained that the SD card was a slow version and needed to be replaced. So I persuaded Bruce to record the talk on my phone. That meant that I had to write out my introduction to the speaker.</p>
