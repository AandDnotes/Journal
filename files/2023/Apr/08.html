        <h1>Saturday 8th April</h1>
        <p>A misty start to the day turned into a sunny morning, cloudy over lunch and sunny again by the end of the day. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then took the TC to Camelia Botna for coffee and for Angela to buy a rose and some bedding plants. The car went well on the 22 mile trip via Ashurst and back via Henfield.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden while I did the weekly accounts and then completed an application for an ESTA for each of us. It was quite a lengthy process and the site did not give an immediate response.</p>
