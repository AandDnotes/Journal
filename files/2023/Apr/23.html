        <h1>Sunday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did a few jobs and then took the TC, in the rain, down to the church to wait for her. We then went off to Parham House as part of Drive-It Day. There were quite a few people (and MGs) there when we arrived. People were standing under the club's gazebo. The rained eased and so we went into the garden, found a shelter (with chairs) and ate our packed lunch. We then bought some hot chocolate from the cafe. Then the sun came out and it was very pleasant. We left just after 3pm (my mobile did not receive the national alert signal), but it started raining just before we got home. I dried off the top of the car.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Paul and Rowan. They are looking to have their drive re-made.</p>
