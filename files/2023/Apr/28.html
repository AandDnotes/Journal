        <h1>Friday 28th April</h1>
        <p>A busy day, wet in the morning, but dry later. Angela produced more cakes for the craft fair and I generated a start slide for Tuesday's talk.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took the TC to Findon, where Angela bought a pair of sandals before the shoe shop closed down. We came home via Beeding to put some fuel in the car. We had the hood down and hats on. The TC took a lot of starting. In fact I initially thought that it would not start, since there was not even a single fire. So I must check/clean the plugs and points. Just before we got home, hard braking pulled severely to the left. So that is another job before the next Wanderers run.</p>
        <p>It was noticeably warmer and so later in the day I washed three of the seven columns of panels of the garage door.</p>
