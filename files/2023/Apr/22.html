        <h1>Saturday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>After the usual walk to the High Street to buy a paper, we spent the morning catching up on email and the weekly accounts. I also opened (or tried to open) a savings account into which to put the remaining cash from Dad's account. But Aldermore couldn't verify my bank account, so I have to send them a bank statement.</p>
        <p>The day started calm, cloudy and not too cold, but at lunchtime the sun came out and stayed out until dinner time. So we went into the garden, Angela to cut the grass and weed, me to clean the facias around the garage.</p>
        <p>I had just finished when Victoria messaged, so we listened to her for an hour before getting dinner ready. Afterwards I did a little reading about gradient decent.</p>
