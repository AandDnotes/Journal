        <h1>Thursday 13th April</h1>
        <p>As usual on Thursdays we went off this morning to do the weekly supermarket shop. It was fine, but chilly and we decided to go to Lidl in Shoreham. That meant that we could go to Dunelm for coffee. We also looked at outside lights and went on to B&amp;Q and bought a light and two GU10 LED bulbs. This will replace the light by the front door. It has a PIR, so should turn on when someone approaches in the dark. I will also remove the two lights on the front of the garage and the PIR light on the side.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch, Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to close one of the WI's bank accounts. Luckily she missed the rain, but it then rained heavily during the afternoon and evening.</p>
        <p>I incorporated my trial image conversion code into my main number categorisation code. It now seems to work, although I have only tested it one set of hand-drawn numbers.</p>
