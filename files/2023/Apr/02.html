        <h1>Sunday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I did most of the preparation for Tuesday's talk, including the start slide and speaker's certificate. I also formatted a memory card and charged the batteries for the video camera.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and later with Paul. Otherwise I 'played' with my python project, trying to simplify the image conversion processes. However, so far it has made little difference.</p>
