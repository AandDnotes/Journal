        <h1>Thursday 27th April</h1>
        <p>We had a busy morning, starting with a trip to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. We then went on to Rogers Farm for coffee (and Angela looked at plants) before going to the shoe shop in Findon. We found that the shop is closing in a week and there were not many pairs of shoes left. Angela bought some boots that were reduced from £175 down to £15. They were too cheap to leave. Angela might go back tomorrow to buy some sandals, even though they are more expensive.</p>
        <p>Later Angela cooked some cakes for the craft fair at the weekend and I did more work on my AI presentation.</p>
