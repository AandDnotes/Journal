        <h1>Thursday 20th April</h1>
        <p>We set off fairly early this morning to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. Angela had a token for £9 off a £60 spend. She also used some Nectar points to get another £10 off, so it was a relatively cheap shop. She also had a voucher for the cafe at the Old Barn nursery, so we went off there for coffee. Angela then bought some plants and some birthday cards. It was almost lunch time by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to a WI meeting and I cleaned the facias, soffits, gutters, down-pipes and 'planking' on the front. That tired me out, so I gave up after that. I then 'played' with my AI project to save some images for my talk. I also found a bug in the program.</p>
