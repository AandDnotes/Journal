        <h1>Tuesday 25th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to garden centres looking for a foxglove for Celia and I removed the fuel line between the carburettors and started cleaning up the banjo and the bolt. One side of the banjo has a recess, so a little later I sanded down a fibre washer to fit. I also cleaned the flat face of the banjo. However, the fibre washer did not seem deep enough to prevent the bolt head from meeting the banjo and therefore not compressing the washer properly. So I put the old washer under the bolt head. When I turned on the fuel pump there was no leak. So fingers crossed!</p>
        <p>In between I had a Teams call with Liza from the IET about the problem with my events programme blog page. She will ask the developers if they can shed any light on the problem.</p>
        <p>After lunch I continued cleaning the weeds off the drive. I finished the part in front of the garage and removed the worst of the weeds on the rest. Then I did some more work on elements of my AI presentation.</p>
