        <h1>Sunday 16th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church, I wrote a couple of email, including 'signing up' for the next London walk, and then removed the two outside lamps on the front of the garage. Although, after lunch, I intended to remove the lamp by the front door, Victoria called and so we spent most of the afternoon talking with her and then with Paul. I did manage to add a few clips to the piece of plastic netting on the garden wall.</p>
