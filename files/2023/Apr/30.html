        <h1>Sunday 30th April</h1>
        <p>It was four years ago today that we moved into Penlands Vale. It doesn't seem anywhere near as long. While Angela was a t church, I cleaned and checked the plugs and points on the TC. It took a lot of turning on Friday before it fired. Then I finished cleaning the garage door. It looks a lot better.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They were kitting Austin out for his scout camp next weekend. I tried to get a number, written by Austin, via his iPad and our iPad to the camera on the MacBook. It didn't work. In fact it produced an error in the code. Then we spoke with Paul. He is taking some days off work and they are going to the forest for a couple of days.</p>
