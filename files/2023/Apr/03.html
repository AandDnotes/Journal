        <h1>Monday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at her exercise group I tried to find out why the iMac is so slow. The diagnostics said that all is well. I then booted the system in safe mode. It was still sluggish, but not as bad as when booted normally. So really no further forward. Current versions of the iMac only come with M1 processors and Solid State Drives. However, they are only 256GB or 512GB. We are currently using over 300GB of our 1TB disc.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I also modified my start slide for tomorrow (the start time for the next-but-one talk is different to usual) and did the same to the programme document. I also uploaded the latest version of the pdf file to the programme blog page.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I made further modifications to my image processing, moving around parts of the process so as to do as much as possible before reducing the size of the image. However, I discovered a description of what was done to produce the mnist images. The digits were adjusted to fit within 20x20 pixels, which was then placed centrally in the 28x28 pixel image.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting, which had been brought forward a week due to Easter.</p>
