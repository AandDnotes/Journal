        <h1>Saturday 29th April</h1>
        <p>A mainly, if not particularly warm day. We left the house at about 9:20 to take cakes to the church hall. Angela stayed to help set up for producing lunches, while I bought a paper and rolls, took them home and then went back to the church to sell lunch tickets. The numbers were down on previous years, but they are doing it all again on Monday, which is a bank holiday.</p>
        <p>I left after our lunch, which was later than we are used to. Angela stayed to help clear up. When I got home I did the weekly accounts, although I still have the monthly accounts to do. Otherwise, we read the paper and I did a little more to my AI presentation in an attempt to make it simpler.</p>
