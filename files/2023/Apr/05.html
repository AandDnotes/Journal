        <h1>Wednesday 5th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early(ish) to go walking with the WI group. Meanwhile I emailed thanks to last night's speaker and to Bruce for using my phone to record the talk. Having uploaded the recording to the iMac, it looks as though it should be useable. I also received a letter from Sue McNaughton about Hamish's funeral. I scanned it and sent it to both the IET group and the Eurotherm group. So far, Martin and Mike will share a car.</p>
        <p>Angela went out again after lunch and was out for most of the afternoon. I started doing a little more towards my python project, although not much.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we walked to the Steyning Centre to see a film, 'Mrs Harris goes to Paris'. It was entertaining. During the interval I spoke with Peter and Teeny from across the road.</p>
