        <h1>Monday 24th April</h1>
        <p>Angela was out for most of the day. In the morning she went to her exercise group and after lunch to her last WI meeting.</p>
        <p>I looked at the TC's fuel lines to the carbs, only to find a big leak when I turned on the pump. The hold-up bolts were also loose. Later I found some fibre washers that might fit, so I'll try remaking the joint.</p>
        <p>Since Angela had taken the Panda I swept the garage floor and also spent some time removing weeds from the drive. But I didn't get far. Later I did some more work trying to understand backpropagation in my AI project.</p>
