        <h1>Saturday 1st April</h1>
        <p>The rain had more or less stopped by the time we went to the High Street. Angela went into the market to take recycling and look for plants, while I went to the news agents. So we kept reasonably dry.</p>
        <p>For me, the rest of the morning, after coffee and a read of the paper, was spent doing the weekly and monthly accounts. Meanwhile, Angela 'played' with compost in the garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch I experimented further with my python project. The neural network still gets some numbers wrong. I examined the values in the output neurons (ten of them). Using an mnist image produced one value that was almost 1.0. Similarly with my images that were classified correctly, but those that were not produced a spread of very low values. There is some suggestion that the mnist images have been centred and so I might need to do that to my images.</p>
