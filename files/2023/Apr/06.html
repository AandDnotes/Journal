        <h1>Thursday 6th April</h1>
        <p>We had a message from Victoria yesterday to say that a package would be arriving this morning. So we waited until it was delivered before going off to do the weekly supermarket shop. The package was a collection of cheeses! I think I will be eating the sheep's and goat's cheese! So we were a bit late setting off for Holmebush. Then there was road works on the way to Shoreham which delayed us further, but we started with coffee in M&amp;S. We got home just before one.</p>
        <p>I had a request to help with a workshop on using the IET's EngX, but they wanted to hold it while we plan to be in the New Jersey. So they have moved the date forward to before we go! I also finished editing the recording of Tuesday's talk and started exporting it.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the Post Office and later we walked to Hyde Square in Beeding. Neither the Post Office nor Nisa had any cable clips to fix some plastic mesh to the garden wall. The walk was very tiring and my new boots were hurting my ankles.</p>
