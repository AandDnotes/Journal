        <h1>Monday 17th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to set up for the lunch club. I removed the outside lamp by the front door. I had intended fitting the new lamp, but there were a lot of holes, so I removed the plastic plugs and filled them with some mortar. Then I went down to the church hall to help take the money from people as they arrived. Then help put away the tables.</p>
        <p>A cloudy start turned into a sunny day. After a light tea I went off to Crawley for the IET Sussex committee meeting. We only had four people at the Hawth, with three others online!</p>
