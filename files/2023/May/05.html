        <h1>Friday 5th May</h1>
        <p>A quieter day; warm and quite sunny. Angela took a couple of walks to the High Street and spent a lot of time in the garden. I had a brief spell in the front, starting to prune a bush, but then decided to leave it to Angela.</p>
        <p>I started trying to edit the video recording of Tuesday's talk. However, I found that the files from the camera ,although using the correct codec, seems to have some incompatibility with Quicktime and iMovie. I passed the first file through Handbrake and the output file seems to work with both apps.</p>
        <p>I also did a little more to my AI presentation.</p>
