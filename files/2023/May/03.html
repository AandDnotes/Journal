        <h1>Wednesday 3rd May</h1>
        <p>Angela was busy as usual, on a very sunny day. She went off with her WI walking group to a bluebell wood at Thakeham. I found that I'd transferred money to the new Aldermore account from the wrong account (not the nominated account) so they returned the money. I had to wait for it to arrive, then move it to our current account and transfer it again to the Aldermore account. I also loaded the two recordings of yesterday's talk, one from my phone and one from the camera's SD card, to the iMac.</p>
        <p>After lunch I refitted the the front, near-side brake drum and then removed each of the rear brake drums. The off-side was very dry and clean, although the near-side was a little oily. I had hoped to take the car for a test run, but ran out of time.</p>
