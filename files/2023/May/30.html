        <h1>Tuesday 30th May</h1>
        <p>Last week we managed to close a Santander savings account (with ten pence in it) and so today we set off to close a Co-op account containing about Â£11. We drove to Shoreham and parked in the recreation ground car park, then caught the 700 bus to Brighton, the location of the nearest Co-op bank branch. The bus made a lot of stops and was then diverted off Western Road in Brighton before coming back down near the clock tower.</p>
        <p>We started with coffee in Waterstones (on the third floor) and then found the Co-op bank. Angela was given cash, but two pence in interest will be paid into our Barclays account!</p>
        <p>We then went to the Apple store to see if they could suggest why our iMac runs so slowly. Their only suggestion was to take it into them for a check!</p>
        <p>After walking around a bit we went to the library and had some lunch in their cafe before catching the bus home. A faster journey this time, so we were home at about 2:30. Angela then did some work in the garden and I added to my notes on my AI project.</p>
