        <h1>Monday 1st May</h1>
        <p>'May Day' and another day at the 'Craft and Hobbies Fair'. After breakfast, Angela made a chocolate roulade to add to the list of puddings at the fair.</p>
        <p>Angela left home just after 9:30 and I left a little later, going to the Coop to get some cash on the way. It was a slow start, although I sold about as many lunches as on Saturday. Overall, the footfall was low.</p>
        <p>I got home just after 3:30 and Angela arrived just before five.</p>
