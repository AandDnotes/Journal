        <h1>Sunday 28th May</h1>
        <p>Another sunny and quite warm day. While Angela went off to church I modified my slide about the IET Sussex web page and noted a few problems with using EngX. I also added a little to my AI project write-up.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul. Then I tried to remove the aphids from the leaves of the apple tree.</p>
