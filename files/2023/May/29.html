        <h1>Monday 29th May</h1>
        <p>Another bright day, with a cool and quite strong wind. We started by walking down to the High Street for the Steyning Country Fair. We walked up down and up the High Street, listening to the brass band and watching jugglers/acrobats, and then went the Steyning Centre for a coffee and to listen to a young pianist.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had quite a long walk, stopping at St Nicholas to see the Art Trail exhibition and have a cup of tea. Then we went on to see the plaque on the WI's tree for the Platinum Jubilee.</p>
