        <h1>Thursday 11th May</h1>
        <p>Austin's birthday. As we were driving into the garage so he called to thank us for his present. So we had a short word with him while he was eating his breakfast, ten minutes before he had to leave for school. He had a science test today!</p>
        <p>We had been out to do the weekly shop. We started in Worthing, where, eventually, I bought a pair of 'summer' shoes (and a pair of insoles to take up some of the space). We also bought some 'coronation' sweets to take to New Jersey, before going for coffee and then to do the grocery shopping. It was one o'clock before we got home.</p>
        <p>Angela did some work in the garden after lunch and I 'fixed' the Github synchronisation problem from yesterday, installed some updates on the Linux system, then added a slide to my AI talk after reading an article in Saturday's Telegraph.</p>
