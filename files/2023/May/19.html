        <h1>Friday 19th May</h1>
        <p>A frustrating day, at least for me. I bought my train travel card for Monday, along with car parking at Shoreham, both of which took longer than expected.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden and then visited the hygienist during the afternoon. She also did a lot of cleaning and washing. I spent a lot of time trying to get Python on the Linux system to use some imported themes, but with no success.</p>
        <p>I updated the operating system on the MacBook, which was straight forward. However, doing the same update on the iMac was more problematic. After a further restart it all seemed to work, although still as slowly as before.</p>
        <p>Alan called after lunch. They are going to Pisa on Monday with four friends. After a few days they are travelling to Bologna by bus. However, this is where there are floods! So they are trying to find somewhere else to stay before they come home the following Monday. He also said that Richard had bee made redundant from his marketing job with a defence company. He was thinking of moving on anyway, so is not unhappy.</p>
