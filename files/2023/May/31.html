        <h1>Wednesday 31st May</h1>
        <p>Angela was off early this morning with her walking group. She got home just before lunch. I renewed our car insurance (for both cars) and set the maturity option for a Paragon ISA to renew the ISA towards the end of June.</p>
        <p>Again, Angela did some work in the garden and I finished drafting my notes on my AI project. Later in the evening I updated the project on Github.</p>
