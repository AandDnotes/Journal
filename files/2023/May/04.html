        <h1>Thursday 4th May</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Although it started cloudy, the sun came out later in the morning. We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. Then we went on to Spring Gardens to buy some asparagus (and two mugs of coffee). So that was most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC for a test run, which was my usual figure of eight. The brakes seemed to be fine. We then walked down to the Steyning Centre to vote in the District and Parish elections. After dong our Dutch lessons we went into the front garden. I trimmed the 'round' bush at the end of the drive. We filled the garden waste bin. Luckily we had just cleared up when it rained heavily.</p>
