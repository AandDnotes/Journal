        <h1>Wednesday 24th May</h1>
        <p>A quieter day that was mainly sunny, most of the day. Angela went off early to join her walking friends, not getting home until after one o'clock. I added a link to the recording of our last IET talk to the web site and 'played' with my AI program on the linux laptop. I tried again to use a theme, but gave up (again).</p>
        <p>After lunch we added money to our Post Office Money Card. We wanted to move money from Angela's RBS account, but the RBS refused the transaction and blocked the card. It took a lot of time (including waiting on the telephone) to get it unblocked and then to log into the account. I also found out how to ungroup objects and modified one of the slides that had not ported properly.</p>
