        <h1>Wednesday 17th May</h1>
        <p>We had a power cut during the night. Then Angela went off walking before I had finished showering. The walking group went for a long walk, starting at Beggar's Bush. She got home just before the new chairs were delivered. I viewed Ramon's latest edit of his STEM video collection, then looked at the new IET volunteers web pages.</p>
        <p>When I tried to open the Linux laptop, which I'd left 'sleeping' simply by closing the lid, it had no desktop! I re-installed the elementary-desktop and it all seemed to work. Then I found that there were two IDLE apps in the Applications window. Both were Python 3.10, whereas I have version 3.11 on the MacBook. I installed the rest of the libraries and tested that they would import into IDLE. Later I copied the AAN data and my AI program to the Linux system and ran it. It sort of worked. The video was a bit delayed and keeps flashing, although I was able to make it work. However, the colours of the window do not follow the system theme.</p>
        <p>Just before lunch our new chairs arrived. The terracotta sofa and my chair were taken out and the two chairs brought inside. Angela then rearranged the room.</p>
