        <h1>Sunday 14th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off (she was given a lift) to a service in a field! I tried to update the Advanced Passenger Information on the Iceland Air website. But it refused to accept some of the data! I checked that the phone was set for roaming and looked up the charges, but the mbna refused to go to the page that told me about using the card overseas! But I did look up train times and found out how much is on our money card. Then I started estimating the cash that we will need on the trip.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with both Victoria and Paul. None of the grandchildren were particularly communicative (as usual). Next week, Brandon will find out if he still has a job!</p>
