        <h1>Wednesday 10th May</h1>
        <p>A good, but tiring day. We both left the house at the same time; Angela to go walking (starting with a lift to Southwick) and me in the TC. The sky was blue and the sun was shining, although the weather forecast for later was not so good.</p>
        <p>I drove to Lyminster to pick up David F-B and then we went on to Denmans Gardens to meet up with the other Sussex Wanderers. After coffee we all set off. We were the last to leave, with Micheal (another TC owner) following us. It was quite a long and challenging run, with lots of twists and turns, until we reached the Chichester Yacht Club for lunch. We left fairly early, since David had to take Fran to the station.</p>
        <p>The weather stayed dry until we pulled into the yacht club car park, so I put the hood up. We left it up on our way home, although it didn't start raining until I left David's. I drove the TC a total of 92 miles. The red fuel warning light was just coming on as I arrived in Steyning. The car ran well.</p>
        <p>I spent a little time adding a note of the outing to my TC4985 web site, but the table of contents is not showing the new entry. It is there, but hidden. A problem to sort out. I was also getting emails from Github saying the the updates were failing! So I don't know what is now on the server.</p>
