        <h1>Sunday 7th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I finished the monthly accounts and then started converting the rest of the files from the video camera. Hopefully I can then combine them and edit them in iMovie tomorrow.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) lunch we walked down to the High Street to view the Vintage Revival. It was busy and quite interesting. The weather was much better today, even sunny later in the afternoon. Rowan had visitors today, because of her birthday tomorrow, so we spoke to them just before dinner.</p>
        <p>After dinner we watched the Coronation Concert.</p>
