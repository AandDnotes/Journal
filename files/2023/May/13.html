        <h1>Saturday 13th May</h1>
        <p>The weather started grey, cool and breezy. However, it soon warmed and became sunny. We started by going to the pharmacy to pick up my (correct) repeat prescription and then went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning doing the accounts, including reconciliation against the statement, while Angela worked in the garden. We had a slightly early lunch, because I went to the Repair Cafe, starting at two. It was relatively quiet, although I started straight away with a broken toaster. Graham helped me, testing the resistance of the elements. After taking it apart we discovered a bread package tie (with a metal core) in the bottom that was shorting out the elements. I wasn't so successful with an elderly lady's radio/cassette/CD player which was producing a lot of hiss. It was probably due to aging electronic components.</p>
        <p>I was home by 4:30 and spent the rest of the afternoon putting away the tools and catching up with email.</p>
