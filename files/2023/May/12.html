        <h1>Friday 12th May</h1>
        <p>My only outing was to the dentist for a check-up. It started spitting with rain as I left the house, but luckily it didn't rain too heavily. Nothing needed doing, but the dentist prodded the small lump on my gum above my front, right incisor (which has been there for years) and put some anti-bacterial substance on it. I have to put a little cotton wool, soaked in salt water, on the area for 15 minutes each morning for a week.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the library and borrowed another book on the USA. By this time the temperature had dropped and was quite chilly.</p>
        <p>After discussion with Martin, Monday's London walk has been postponed for a week. That means that I can go to Lunch Club and to the WSMGOC meeting in the evening.</p>
        <p>I spent some time putting tools and materials in my (heavy) tool box in preparation for tomorrow's Repair Cafe. I also did (or at least tried) to do a little more to set up the Linux system to run my AI program.</p>
