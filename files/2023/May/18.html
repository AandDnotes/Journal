        <h1>Thursday 18th May</h1>
        <p>This morning we set off fairly early to Worthing and walked from near Splash Point into town. We started at the bank, where, surprisingly quickly, I was able to close Dad's account. We then went on to M&amp;S where Angela bout some vests and T-shirt. I looked for a light-weight sweater, but they didn't have much choice. It was all summer T-shirts. We went on to Edinburgh Woollen Mill, where I bought a sweater. I was looking for dark green, but Angela found me an orange one! Then it was off to Waitrose for coffee and to do the weekly groceries shop. Angela had a money-off coupon.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela did some work in the garden and I tackled a number of things for our trip to NJ. I:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Managed to add our 'Advanced Passenger Information' via the Iceland Air web site.</li>
          <li>Found that our credit card charges Â£1.50 plus 3% for overseas transactions! So we will use Angela's P.O. Money Card were we can.</li>
          <li>Booked our train tickets for the trip from Boston to New York.</li>
          <li>Downloaded the train schedule from NY to Summit.</li>
          <li>Printed plane, hotel and train booking information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After Mail crashed twice when trying to print and Preview did the same, I set up the printer on the MacBook and used that for one item. Printing from the iMac then worked!</p>
