        <h1>Tuesday 9th May</h1>
        <p>A day when we were told to expect thunder storms, turned out dry. Sometimes there was even some sunshine. I hope that tomorrow is as good (or the forecast as wrong).</p>
        <p>Angela was as busy as usual; working in the garden, walking down to the High Street (twice) and going around to her WI committee chair to get cheques signed (and drink tea). She also cooked a very nice chicken cobbler.</p>
        <p>Although I didn't go out, I had quite a productive day. I ordered an Amazon gift card for Austin (to be delivered tomorrow), uploaded the recording of last week's talk to the Sussex YouTube channel and updated the web page, downloaded the latest version of Elementary OS (eOS 7), created a bootable version and installed it in an old partition on the HP laptop. I was then able to install synaptic (the package manager) and geparted (partition manager), before updating Python 3 (to 3.11). I'n not sure which of the things I tried worked, but Python 3 IDLE is now available from the Applications panel. I now just need to install all the libraries that my AI program uses.</p>
