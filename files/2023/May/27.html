        <h1>Saturday 27th May</h1>
        <p>After our walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper we drove to the pharmacy in Ashington to have our Covid-19 booster jabs. Apparently it was the latest Pfizer vaccine. We then called in to the Big Plant nursery to have coffee in their 'jungle cafe'. Actually, we sat outside in the sunshine.</p>
        <p>After that, it was back to the usual Saturday tasks of the weekly accounts for me and working in the garden for Angela. I also spent some time working out how to better format my web page on my AI project and adding a little to it. There was also quite a bit of newspaper reading.</p>
