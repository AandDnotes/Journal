        <h1>Saturday 20th May</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper. But then, once the washing was finished and hung out, we walked back down to the Penfold hall for a coffee morning. In fact, it was coffee and cake. We spent quite some time chatting and Angela bought a couple of plants (and we waited for the raffle to be drawn), so It was lunchtime by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>Then I had to catch up with my weekly accounts, after which I tried various things to improve the speed of the iMac. I'm not sure that I made any difference. People seem to put it down to not using an SSD. Afterwards I investigated 'themes' further. However, I didn't succeed in using a different theme in python on the Linux laptop. But, perhaps, my understanding has increased a bit.</p>
