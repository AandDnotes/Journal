        <h1>Tuesday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was for a warm, sunny day, so we went off before ten to Wakehurst. The house has been completely covered in a scaffolding tent to project it while it is renovated. The outside has been clad in huge photographs. We went up a set of steps to get a view from the rooftop level of the house.</p>
        <p>After coffee, we walked to the far end of the site and back. Mainly downhill going and uphill coming back. So we were ready for some lunch. Although, as NT members we get into the site without paying, the parking cost us Â£12! We were home by about 3:30.</p>
        <p>Later I closed Angela's Virgin Money account and moved the content to a new account. Then I modified the font of all the text in my ported slide deck on the Linux laptop.</p>
