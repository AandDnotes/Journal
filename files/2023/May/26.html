        <h1>Friday 26th May</h1>
        <p>Another sunny and quite warm day, if a little breezy. On Radio Sussex over breakfast we heard that Petworth House has a set of elephant statues distributed around the grounds. So we decided to go there.</p>
        <p>The traffic through Storrington was heavy, but we arrived just after eleven. As we got out of the car, the strap on Angela's handbag broke. We toured the kitchens and the house before having some lunch and then walking around the lake. We got home just before 3:30 and found that the broadband was working. Angela went to the library and bought a handbag from a charity shop. However, shortly after she went out, at the end of my second Dutch lesson, the power went off! So that was three problems today.</p>
        <p>The forecast from UK Power Networks was for power to be restored between eight and ten, so we walked down to the High Street to buy some food for a cold dinner. The power came back on at six o'clock, but we continued with our cold dinner.</p>
