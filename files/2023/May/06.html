        <h1>Saturday 6th May</h1>
        <p>Coronation Day. It rained nearly all day.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we started by walking to the High Street. I bought a newspaper and Angela took recycling to the Coop and to the market. Whilst there she bought a rhubarb plant. It might take over the garden if we're not careful.</p>
        <p>We started watching the TV at about ten, just before the Kin's procession from Buckingham Palace started. My intent had been to just watch the processions, but we spent the rest of the day, until about 3:30, watching the coronation broadcast. It was quite spectacular.</p>
        <p>Victoria called. They had also been watching it in New Jersey. Austin's friend was unwell and so did not go to the scout camp, so Austin lost his nerve and also didn't go. Victoria had spoken (online) to Austin's doctor, who thinks that anxiety might be the route cause of Austin's problems, or perhaps masking other symptoms.</p>
        <p>I then managed to do the weekly accounts and start the monthly accounts, which I should have done last week.</p>
