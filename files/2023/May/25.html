        <h1>Thursday 25th May</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Santander in Worthing to close an Easy Saver account that contained the princely sum of 10p. Then it was back to Waitrose for coffee and the weekly grocery shop.</p>
        <p>Shortly after getting home, our internet connection failed! Virgin Media said, in a recorded message, that it would be midnight before it would be restored. In fact, although they sent a message to say that it was now working, we couldn't connect the following morning. So no Dutch lessons and no journal. Luckily we don't rely on our broadband for TV.</p>
