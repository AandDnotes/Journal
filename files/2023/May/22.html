        <h1>Monday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>I left the house first this morning and drove to Shoreham station to catch the 09:43 train to London. I found Barbara on the train, although Steve and Graham were also on board, towards the rear. Martin joined at East Grinstead. We had a liesurley walk over Blackfriars bridge, along the South Bank and back over Tower Bridge. We stopped for lunch in the canteen of Southwark Cathedral and then dinner at Victoria. I arrived home at ten to nine.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela helped her WI friends put a plaque by the tree that was planted for the Queen's platinum jubilee.</p>
