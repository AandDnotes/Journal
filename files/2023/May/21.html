        <h1>Sunday 21st May</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I managed to find a way to import themes from ttkbootstrap. however, other use of styles then clashed and so the program would not run. However, I had more success with porting my presentation. I exported it from Keynote as a PowerPoint file and then imported it into Libre Office on the Linux system. To my surprise, although the font was different, the equations ported well. So I started exploring the options for fonts.</p>
        <p>Our afternoon was spent talking to Victoria and Paul. Brandon still has a job, but is talking to a company in California! Angela then went to the Coop to buy a lemon and a pepper before she started cooking.</p>
