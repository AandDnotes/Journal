        <h1>Tuesday 16th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Storrington this morning to bank the cash from the Lunch Club. I emailed Harvey about carburettor tuning and investigated the installation of Python on the Linux laptop.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I discovered that I had two versions of Python 3 (3.10 and 3.11) and the numpy library had been installed in version 10, whereas IDLE in the application window was for version 11. I tried to uninstall version 10, but it actually uninstalled version 11. I reinstalled version 11, but then installed IDLE for version 10, which is now in the application window. So I will use this version.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I trimmed another bush with the electric hedge-cutter. I realised, half an hour before I was due to go to Falmer, that no one would have produced an attendance list. So I downloaded the list and printed it. For some reason Pages crashed twice and I forgot to change the heading, so had to write it in.</p>
        <p>The talk at Falmer, the last of our season, on the Brighton Atlantic Project was quite interesting.</p>
