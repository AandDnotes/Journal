        <h1>Tuesday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street and the library and I produced the speaker certificate and attendance list for the evening's talk. I also tested the video camera. It produced a 'static' video, with sound. Then the display went to grey-scale. Restarting it seemed to put it right.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went into the garden and I went into the garage. I removed both front brake drums on the TC and brushed them out. They seem to be as they should be, but they did need adjusting. I also touched up some paint on the near-side drum.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove to Crawley for the IET Sussex talk. I used both the video camera and my phone to record it; just in case. It was a long talk, but seemed to go down well with the audience.</p>
