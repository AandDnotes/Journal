        <h1>Monday 15th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to the Lunch Club this morning. She wasn't cooking, so went later. I went later still, just helping to clear up afterwards.</p>
        <p>Earlier I renewed a maturing ISA of Angela's. Later I added some notes to my TC Outings web page and then, after tea, I went to the WSMGOC meeting, spending a lot of time talking with Harvey about carburettors on our TCs.</p>
