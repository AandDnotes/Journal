        <h1>Monday 8th May</h1>
        <p>A mainly dry, but chilly Bank Holiday Monday. Although it did start raining at about four o'clock. Angela spent most of her day out in the garden, while I edited and then exported the recording of last Tuesday's talk and passed it through Handbrake to compress it.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we had a quick word with Rowan after her tennis lesson, since today is her 11th birthday.</p>
        <p>Also, I played with ChatGPT, firstly asking it questions about how it worked and later about Dall-E 2. The answers were useful and I incorporated them into my slide set as extras that I can use to help answer questions.</p>
