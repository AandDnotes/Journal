        <h1>Saturday 16th December</h1>
        <p>We expected it to be dry and sunny today, but it was overcast and damp all day. Angela went to buy a newspaper while I did the weekly accounts and reconciled them against the bank statement. Later in the morning we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I ordered Amazon gift cards for Victoria et al before we spoke with Paul. He will meet us at Rotterdam airport on Wednesday.</p>
