        <h1>Saturday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>The cold mist didn't really abate all day. And so it stayed cold all day, not getting above one degree all day. As usual on a Saturday we walked to the High Street to get a newspaper. Since a letter was delivered to us, instead of to Penlands Rise, we decided to go out again to deliver it, post a set of Christmas cards, get some cash and look around the Christmas craft fair at the Steyning Centre.</p>
        <p>Angela went out again during the afternoon to buy some more stamps, while I did the weekly accounts. Otherwise it was a case of reading the paper.</p>
