        <h1>Thursday 14th December</h1>
        <p>A calmer and drier day. We were off to do the weekly shop a little than usual, even though we had less to buy this week. We then went off to the Jungle Cafe on our way home.</p>
        <p>I emailed details of our PEI meetings to the secretary of the Chartered Quality Institute and then updated the pdf version of our events programme 'booklet'. Whilst shopping I bought new batteries for the garage door remote. However, when I changed them the device would not work. On the one hand I found that the two batteries did not make good contact when placed together in one way, but it was fine when they were put together the other way. But still no joy. So I cleaned the contacts in the remote with nail polish remover and all seemed to be well. We will just have to see if it continues to work.</p>
