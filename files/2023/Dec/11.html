        <h1>Monday 11th December</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early this morning to help set up for the Lunch Club's Christmas lunch. I went down at 12:30 to join her, or really to eat lunch. It was a very good lunch. The turkey had good flavour, the roast potatoes were crispy and the sprouts and carrots were nicely cooked. It was better than the meal at the Findon Hotel on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Before going down to the church I din't do much at all apart from researching RC flying simulators.</p>
