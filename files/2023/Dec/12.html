        <h1>Tuesday 12th December</h1>
        <p>It was a tiring morning for Angela and afternoon and evening for me. An inspector went to check the church kitchen and it failed on a couple of items. After lunch Peter W picked me up and we went to the RCEA talk at Field Place. It was quite a good talk on 'space junk'.</p>
        <p>When I got home I had half an hour before I went off to Crawley for the IET talk on innovations at Gatwick Airport. Another interesting talk. I also met some members of the Chartered Quality Institute (CQI) who had seen our talk advertised. They are interested in joining our PEI group.</p>
        <p>It rained for a lot of the day.</p>
