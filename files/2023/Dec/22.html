        <h1>Friday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>A drier and slightly less windy day. Again, Rowan went off to school before we got up, but, being the last day of term, we collected her at midday.</p>
        <p>We then went off to a very large garden centre. It seemed mainly full of Christmas decorations, although Krista did by a water plant for the poorly axolotls tank. We had lunch in the cafe there and were home by mid afternoon. After tea we played an online game of skribbl.io.</p>
