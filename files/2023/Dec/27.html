        <h1>Wednesday 27th December</h1>
        <p>We had planned to go out for lunch today, but Rowan was feeling unwell and Krista was still feeling a little under par. So we did a lot of jigsaw puzzle, leaving just the difficult green and red pieces.</p>
        <p>Although it was raining when we got up, during the day it was relatively calm and dry, but became windier during the evening and rained.</p>
        <p>After 7pm (the time of our flight tomorrow) I checked us in and downloaded our boarding passes.</p>
