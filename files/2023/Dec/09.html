        <h1>Saturday 9th December</h1>
        <p>Today was all about cooking and slicing the rolled turkey breast for Monday's lunch club. Angela collected the turkey from the butcher and we put the two rolls in the oven, with the meat thermometer in one. We sat reading the paper until the centre of the meat had been above 70 degrees for over two minutes. We then went home for lunch while they cooled.</p>
        <p>Before I left home, one of the lenses popped out of my glasses. So I went into the optician's for them to tighten the fixing.</p>
        <p>Later we went back to the church kitchen and sliced the turkey rolls, putting them in the fridge for Monday. We were home by four.</p>
