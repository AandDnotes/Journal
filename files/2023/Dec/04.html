        <h1>Monday 4th December</h1>
        <p>An early start (6:35). Peter picked me up and we caught the 8:46 train from Shoreham to Victoria. We walked across the Thames to Battersea power Station and then joined a pre-booked tour, which was very good and culminated in the old control room of one of the two halls. The inside is full of shops and restaurants. After lunch (a chicken and avocado baguette) we went up one of the chimneys (Lift 109). The top is 109 meters above ground level. The view was not very good due to the mist and rain.</p>
        <p>After looking around and at the power station timeline, we walked to the 'pie pub', where I had steak and ale pie. It was a bit too much and too salty. Then we walked back to Victoria station and caught the 7:16 back to Shoreham.</p>
        <p>A pleasant, but tiring day.</p>
