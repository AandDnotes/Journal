        <h1>Sunday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>It rained for most for the day, although it was a little warmer. While Angela was at church I did the monthly accounts. That took most of the morning. Otherwise there was a lot of reading of the paper.</p>
        <p>Paul et al were celebrating Sinterklaas day. So they had visitors until we were dishing up dinner. But we had a chat with them afterwards. Then Victoria messaged to say that they were back from a trip to the Science Centre. So we had a chat with her.</p>
