        <h1>Friday 15th December</h1>
        <p>After Angela hung out the washing and I printed our train tickets and flight details, we walked to Beeding, to the Hub, for coffee and then went to Kingsmead Close to deliver a couple of Christmas cards. We spoke to Neil and Fiona and so didn't deliver any more cards. Angela went out again after lunch to deliver three more.</p>
        <p>It stayed dry, but was mainly cloudy, so again little chance of seeing the meteor shower.</p>
