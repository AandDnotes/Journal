        <h1>Friday 29th December</h1>
        <p>We arrived home yesterday evening to an empty fridge, so, a little later than usual, we went off to do a supermarket shop. We started at Waitrose, popped down to the new toy shop in Warwick Street to look for the 'Cat in Boxes' puzzle. They had sold out! Then we moved to Lidl to finish our shop.</p>
        <p>So we were a little late home for lunch.Washing went on before we went out and again when we got back. It was a pity that it rained while we were out and the first wash had to be spun again.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street, but the butcher had closed earlier than usual. I paid the window cleaner, by online cash transfer, and then set up a new savings account, into which I moved some money from our current account.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela didn't feel very well, so she just had a boiled egg, while I had 'oven' fish and chips.</p>
