        <h1>Wednesday 13th December</h1>
        <p>For me today was all about the December Sussex Wanderers outing. I met the group at the Red Lion in Ashington. David F-B texted me just as I arrived. He was still at home. However, he arrived just before we needed to leave for a relatively short run on good roads. David had brought his Triumph GT6, a nice mid blue. We came back towards Steyning, went up through Ashurst to Partridge Green, on to Cowfold, along the A272, cutting the corner off to the A24 and then back into Ashington. So we had plenty of time for a chat before lunch.</p>
        <p>The food was very good and then there was more chat. I got home about 3:30. Meanwhile, Angela was at table tennis. There was a little drizzle to start with, but the weather dried up and was quite bright.</p>
