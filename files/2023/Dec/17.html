        <h1>Sunday 17th December</h1>
        <p>A slightly different Sunday, although it was still overcast. Rather than going to church in the morning, Angela went to a carol concert in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>So in the morning she hung out washing and pottered in the garden. I bled the radiators. In fact it is only the study radiator that collects air. I also checked the route between Victoria and London City Airport suggested by Transport for London and printed part of the tube/DLR map.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunchtime and then spoke with Victoria. For a change, both Austin and Juniper spoke to us, briefly. Then Angela went out, getting home at about six o'clock. I spent the rest of the afternoon listening to the radio and reading the paper.</p>
