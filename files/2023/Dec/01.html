        <h1>Friday 1st December</h1>
        <p>A cold, but mainly grey day. We started by walking to the Hub in Beeding for coffee. That was a good outing and took most of the morning. When we got home I spent some time trying to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor on the outside light so that it doesn't come on when a car goes past!</p>
        <p>The afternoon was mainly spent reading.</p>
