        <h1>Monday 18th December</h1>
        <p>I basically did nothing today. Whereas Angela went to her Monday club and later went to give blood. On a breezy, overcast day I stayed in doors.</p>
        <p>We had our 'weekly' delivery of post today. There were about 30 items of post, so I had quite a lot of envelopes to open and a few letters/notes to read. Angela pinned up the cards on the 'Christmas' ribbons.</p>
        <p>I read parts of the newspaper/magazine and things that came in the post. Angela was unable to give blood, since her iron level was too low.</p>
