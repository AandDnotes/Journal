        <h1>Thursday 21st December</h1>
        <p>Rowan went off to school before we got up. It was a very windy and wet day, so, apart from a quick visit to the ponies between the showers, we stayed inside.</p>
        <p>Later, Greet and Wim called, to leave Max (their dog) while they went off to a friend's Golden Wedding party. They collected him later.</p>
