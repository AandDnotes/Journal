        <h1>Thursday 7th December</h1>
        <p>Today was all about Christmas lunch. That is, the RCEA Christmas lunch, taking place at the Findon Manor Hotel. We arrived at about midday and got home at 3:30. It was dry and reasonably warm on the way there, but very wet on the way home. We had quite a good lunch, although the outside of the roast potatoes were hard.</p>
        <p>Before and after the meal we spent most of the day reading.</p>
