        <h1>Sunday 10th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela when to church I prepared a speaker certificate for Tuesday's talk and printed the route instructions for Wednesday. After a dry start it rained heavily for the rest of the morning.</p>
        <p>Most of the afternoon was spent talking with Victoria and Paul.</p>
