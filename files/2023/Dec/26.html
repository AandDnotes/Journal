        <h1>Tuesday 26th December</h1>
        <p>Boxing Day.</p>
        <p>Less wind, less rain and an all together quieter day. We went off in the morning to Goude. Our original intention was to have lunch there, but most shops and restaurants were closed. There was one or two shops open in the main street and a few restaurants open in the main square, but after walking around a bit we decided to come home for lunch.</p>
        <p>We did more of thee jigsaw puzzle and played a couple of games. After dinner (turkey curry) we watched an animated version of 'Scrooge: A Christmas Carol'.</p>
