        <h1>Wednesday 20th December</h1>
        <p>We set off from home at 9:20 and caught the bus to Shoreham. Since this was over an hour earlier than we needed to be, we stopped for a coffee and then sat in the station waiting room for a while. Then we caught the 11:43 train to London Victoria. We sat in Victoria Station and eat our packed lunch before catching two tube trains and then the Docklands Light Railway to London City Airport.</p>
        <p>Since we had already checked in, we went straight to security and then into the departure lounge. Following a cup of tea and a bit of a sit, we were called to the gate for the 4:15 to Rotterdam. We were surprised how many gates there were.</p>
        <p>Boarding the plane was quite short, possibly because it wasn't full. However, it was dark by the time we took off, but was not long before we landed in Rotterdam. As we left the airport and walked towards the K+R area (clearly signed) we met Paul, who had just arrived.</p>
        <p>It was then about a half-hour drive to Berkenwoude. Krista and Rowan were back from an open evening at Rowan's school.</p>
        <p>Although we were not rushed at any point, the journey was quite tiring.</p>
