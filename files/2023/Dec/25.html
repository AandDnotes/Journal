        <h1>Monday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Day.</p>
        <p>The wind overnight blew down the piece of fence that we 'fixed' yesterday. The staples had come out, so we tied the wire to the posts and stapled the end to the house boarding. Luckily, although it had been very windy overnight, it was calm.</p>
        <p>We had showered and done just a little of the jigsaw puzzle by the time that Greet and Wim arrived. We started our Christmas lunch at about two o'clock. It was quite a good turkey and a good selection of vegetables. We had poached pears (cooked and brought by Greet) and ice cream for dessert.</p>
        <p>G&W left before it got dark and, after watching the film 'A Boy Called Christmas' and having a light tea, we played games.</p>
