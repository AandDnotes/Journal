        <h1>Tuesday 5th December</h1>
        <p>Since Angela is out for lunch tomorrow, at a Christmas lunch on Thursday and Angela is out on Friday, we needed to do the weekly supermarket shop today. We went to Spring Farm for coffee afterwards.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to catch up on my Dutch lessons (having missed yesterday), which took some time. Angela walked to the High Street and went to the library. I also made a couple of adjustments to the outside light sensitivity. It was still being triggered by passing cars after the first adjustment!</p>
