        <h1>Saturday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>The days should be getting longer, but you couldn't tell today. It was dry, but the morning was still quite windy. Paul and I went out to 'fix' the piece of fence between their garden and the cottage garden. It was very breezy, but we managed to get some wire fencing in place, with some vertical reed matting tied to it.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was a question of playing games and eating.</p>
