        <h1>Friday 8th December</h1>
        <p>It was a fine, dry and warm day, with only a slight breeze. Angela had to go to the library and the High Street, so I went with her. She called in to the church kitchen on the way to take some things for Monday's lunch club. We ended up having coffee in Truffles.</p>
        <p>Angela was then out (having a cream tea) with the St Barnabas group. She got home at about 4;30. I prepared the 'start slide' for Tuesday's IET talk and then made 'fancy' envelopes for Paul et al's Christmas cash. Getting the washing in, putting away the clothes line and draping the clothes on the airers took some time.</p>
