        <h1>Saturday 30th December</h1>
        <p>A better night's sleep and it wasn't raining. We walked to the High Street. Angela went to the butchers and I bought a newspaper. We were surprised that the TV part was only for today. So Angela went down again later and bought a TV guide, but it was for next week!</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts and set up the spreadsheet for next year. It is the first time that, within my accounts spreadsheets, that we have gone into the red. My pensions were paid early and I moved money into a new savings account, but in my accounts I don't get paid until January.</p>
        <p>I messaged Victoria to see if they wanted a chat. She didn't reply until later to say that they were driving home. Hopefully we can talk with them tomorrow.</p>
