        <h1>Tuesday 19th December</h1>
        <p>Another lazy day for me, although today was all about packing. It rained all morning (and most of the afternoon), so Angela waited until the afternoon before going to the library and buying a few things to go in the freezer.</p>
        <p>Luckily we seem to have got everything into our carry-on cases. After 4:15 I 'checked in' to our flights and printed our boarding cards.</p>
