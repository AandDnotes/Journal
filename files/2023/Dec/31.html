        <h1>Sunday 31st December</h1>
        <p>New Year's Eve!</p>
        <p>I'm still feeling tired, although Angela is better. While she went to church I started assembling my tiny Tiger Moth.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Victoria. They had left Missouri early yesterday and didn't stop until they got home at about 11:30. So they were tired as well. Then we spoke with Paul. They were planning to meet Krista's cousins tomorrow at her grandma's.</p>
