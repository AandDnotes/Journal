        <h1>Thursday 28th December</h1>
        <p>Our last day in Berkenwoude. The weather was still blustery and Rowan's stomach was still feeling a little upset. However, she was talking a lot, so she was obviously feeling a bit better.</p>
        <p>We spent the morning finishing the jigsaw puzzle, apart from the four pieces that were missing. We also packed our cases. At around four o'clock Paul took us to the airport. Luckily the traffic was light and we were there quite early. After a cup of tea and a cookie we went through passport control and to the gate. The plane was on time and only half full. In fact, I think we arrived early.</p>
        <p>The journey from London City Airport home ran mostly according to plan, although there was a lot of up and down escalators and stairs; with our cases. It was very tiring. We had a ham and cheese roll at Victoria Station; upstairs in a not very pleasant food-hall. Our train was on time and the journey, apart from a very irritating young boy nearby, was reasonable.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, when we got to Shoreham there were no taxis. Rather than letting me call one, Angela wanted to walk to the bus stop, even though busses to Steyning are only one an hour. As we approached the High Street, we saw a bus go past. When we looked at the timetable at the bus stop we thought we had just missed the number 2, but a minute later it arrived. So we caught the bus back to Steyning and walked from the bus stop. We got home at about 11 o'clock, turned on the house, had a drink and went to bed.</p>
