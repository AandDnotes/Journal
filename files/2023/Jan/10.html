        <h1>Tuesday 10th January</h1>
        <p>We had a latish morning. It was raining again! It seems that my namesake is applying to be Vice Principal of Cheltenham Ladies' College; so I asked them to look for a middle initial in his email address. They didn't reply.</p>
        <p>I sent our meal choices to Graeme for the pub run later this month and paid for our WSMGOC Annual Dinner by doing a bank transfer. Then I spent some time scanning in more cottage-related photos and adding to my draft web page.</p>
        <p>The rain stopped around lunchtime, which was good because we were both out this afternoon, Angela at a WI meeting and me at an RCEA talk. It was on the TT and the engineering developments to motorcycles brought about by such races. There was yet another WSMGOC member there, five of us in all. It seems that he new person, whose name I can't remember, is also an IET member. The journey home was short (no traffic queues), but the Bostal Road was dark and drizzly, so not pleasant.</p>
