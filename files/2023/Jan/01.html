        <h1>Sunday 1st January</h1>
        <p>The first day of 2023! Drier, but not particularly productive. Angela went to church as usual on a Sunday while I epoxied the fixings on the number three and did the monthly accounts. However, when I tried to refit the number the other fixing came off, as did one on the number one!</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul.</p>
        <p>I had not only to set up a new accounts spreadsheet, but also to set up journal files for January 2023. I still have to make the files for the rest of the year and modify my main html file to access the files.</p>
