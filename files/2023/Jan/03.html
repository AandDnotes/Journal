        <h1>Tuesday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street to buy a few things and put the wheely bin out later in the day, but I didn't venture out. It started raining later in the morning and continued for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>I started preparing the start slide for the talk in a fortnight and Dave and Steve 'emerged' with a stream of email. Otherwise I spent some time reading the paper.</p>
