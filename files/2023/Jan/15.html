        <h1>Sunday 15th January</h1>
        <p>When we got up the rain had stopped and the sun was shining. In fact it stayed sunny until early afternoon when there was quite a heavy shower. It was a pity that the washing was still out! I turned the lights on and then half an hour later the sun was out again.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I filled as may cracks around the house as I could find. That was more than I'd expected, and even then I missed one in the sitting room. It took me nearly all morning.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul. Earlier they had posted photos of their completed fencing to allow the ponies to wander into the shelter.</p>
