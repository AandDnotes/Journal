        <h1>Monday 16th January</h1>
        <p>Another rain free day, but cold. Angela went to her exercise group in the morning and to her WI meeting in the afternoon. I spent a lot of the day 'playing' with my AI project. After a bit of a struggle I managed to get the to get the number recognition network code to run. It calculated the weights and biases on a network with 100 hidden nodes. There were 50,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples and used 30 epochs of mini-batches of ten examples. It was over 97% successful. I found save and load functions in the code and so hope that I can load it and run it on a single example. I managed to save the test data to a file.</p>
