        <h1>Wednesday 18th January</h1>
        <p>Another very cold day, but one with a clear blue sky all day. I phoned the pharmacy to see if my new heart medication had bee prescribed. It had, so I went to collect it. Angela came along to look for some floss. We decided to stop at 'Victoria Sponge' for a coffee and so we got home only a short time before lunch!</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I dealt with some IET-related email and updated information about interest rates on some savings accounts. Later I again failed to progress with my AI project.</p>
