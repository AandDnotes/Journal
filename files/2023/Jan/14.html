        <h1>Saturday 14th January</h1>
        <p>For the forthcoming change in my medication I need to monitor my blood pressure and heart rate. So I did that as soon as we got up.</p>
        <p>After breakfast we dressed in all our waterproofs to go to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. The ground through the twittens was very soggy.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning and doing the weekly account. The latter took a little longer than usual because I had a bank statement against which to reconcile my spreadsheet, but the statement straddled the year boundary. It took me a while to find the missing 20 pence!</p>
        <p>The rain actually stopped just after lunch, but we didn't venture out again. I printed off the notices I need to redirect people at the talk on Tuesday.</p>
