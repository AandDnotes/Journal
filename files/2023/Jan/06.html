        <h1>Friday 6th January</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast, even at breakfast time, said that the clear sky and therefore sunshine would continue until lunchtime and then it would cloud over, but the rain wouldn't arrive until later in the day. So we planned to go for a walk (for Angela to try out her new walking pole) and I even contemplated taking the TC for a run.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street and then went back at midday to have her hair cut. She was fed up with her long hair and so had it shortened and layered (to some extent). I started by emailing Mark about the next LinkedIn and Twitter posts. Then I created and submitted my Adestra email to remind members about the January talk.</p>
        <p>It started raining just after lunch. And continued through the rest of the day. So we didn't go for a walk and I certainly didn't take the TC out. However, I did check both cars and put the TC's battery on charge. We also waisted some time by watching an episode of Father Brown after lunch!</p>
