        <h1>Saturday 21st January</h1>
        <p>Another cold, but sunny day, starting with quite a heavy frost. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then read it for a good part of the morning. I then made notes on the changes to our Coventry Building Society accounts that I made yesterday, updated the savings spreadsheet and did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we had a chat with Victoria. Austin's problems with school work seem to be getting worse rather than better! He certainly seems to prefer one word answers (when he answers at all) when we try to hold a conversation with him. Juniper is reluctant to even let us see her and doesn't talk to us. They both just want to play computer games or silly, noisy games together.</p>
        <p>I managed to investigate the neural network code a little, at least verifying that the 'load' function was working.</p>
