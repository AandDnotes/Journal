        <h1>Day/date</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group, I did more tests on the fuel pump. But it still doesn't work. So I posted a message on the mg-tabc forum. Later I got an email from Peter Cole, inviting me to take the pump over and put it on his test rig. So after lunch I removed the pump and fitted the new fuel pipe between the carburettors.</p>
        <p>Then I installed the latest version of Python 3, installed the pillow library and got it to read in an image and convert it.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended the IET Sussex committee meeting.</p>
