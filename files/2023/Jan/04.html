        <h1>Wednesday 4th January</h1>
        <p>A dryer day, in fact dry enough to hang washing outside. And it was mild again, but breezy.</p>
        <p>I spent some time on IET business. Everyone seems to have come alive again, so I updated the events programme blog page with details of a couple of talks and uploaded a poster. I also rewrote the synopsis of my UK Power Networks talk for the poster (to reduce its size) and sent it to the speaker for comment.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her first table tennis session of the year and I emailed my IMechE contact about a joint talk that Greg has organised.</p>
