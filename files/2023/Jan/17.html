        <h1>Tuesday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Angela was busy today. She started by catching the bus to Storrington to pay in three lots of cash and got home around eleven. Then it was straight down to cooking lunch. We had our main meal at lunchtime since I had an IET talk in the evening.</p>
        <p>Apart from the talk I only dealt with email, printed the attendance list and 'worked' on my AI project. I didn't make a lot of progress, although I learnt a bit.</p>
        <p>The talk was at Falmer and I took the speaker gift/certificate, the start slide and a lot of notices to direct people to the lecture theatre. We only had 20+ attendees, but it was an interesting talk on the circular economy, even if there wasn't a lot on engineering. However, it was very cold. When I left I had to clear the ice from inside the windows! But I was home around 9:30.</p>
