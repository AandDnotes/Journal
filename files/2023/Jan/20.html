        <h1>Friday 20th January</h1>
        <p>Since it was another dry, sunny day I had plans for the morning. I planned to take the TC for a run, possibly to see Hamish. However, after uncovering the car and putting the hood down I turned on the ignition, but the fuel pump did not tick. It would give one tick if I tapped the pump, but would not keep going. So I gave up on the idea and phoned Hamish instead. He had visitors, but said he was good.</p>
        <p>Then I posted a question on the mg-tabc forum, asking if the pump was susceptible to temperature. The reply from everyone was that the points in the pump needed cleaning, probably because I hadn't use the car for a while.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the hygienist/dentist just before lunch. Luckily she didn't need any work done. I dealt with our Coventry Building Society accounts, closing the easy-access account, moving the money to our new bonds. I also set up regular savings accounts.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the day reading the AI book and Angela made a batch of marmalade.</p>
