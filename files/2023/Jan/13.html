        <h1>Friday 13th January</h1>
        <p>It was dry and sunny when we got up and it stayed that way throughout the day. In fact, the wind eased during the day. It was Victoria and Brandon's wedding anniversary (16 years) so I sent them an email. They should have received our card. I also prepared the start slide and speaker certificate for Tuesday's talk and we cut the top out of the espalier apple tree.</p>
        <p>After lunch we we went for a walk around the upper horseshoe. We left home just before 2:30 and got home a little before four. It was quite tough going walking up the hill.</p>
