        <h1>Wednesday 11th January</h1>
        <p>It started sunny and not too windy, so Angela washed the table cloths from the lunch club and hung them out. She also went to the High Street to buy one or two things. After working through some email I spent most of the morning working on my 'cottage' web page. Luckily we noticed the rain start and got the table cloths in before they got wet.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I finished drafting the cottage web page. This involved scanning a number of photos. Luckily Angela got a lift home from Marion, since there was a fierce storm. Angela then cook biscuits as well as dinner.</p>
