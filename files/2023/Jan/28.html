        <h1>Saturday 28th January</h1>
        <p>The weekend again already and bright, if not sunny all day. We bought a newspaper on our way to examine the WI's newly planted tree in Abbey Road. The rest of the morning was spent by me doing the weekly accounts and reading the paper.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I continued to try to understand the code and data structures used in the neural network example. The code provided is aimed at the learning process, but not at actually using it to classify hand-written digits. I succeeded in loading the saved, trained network, input the data for one of the validation data images and got the code to classify it. That is the first part of what I want to do. Next will be to work out how to convert an image into the input data.</p>
