        <h1>Wednesday 25th January</h1>
        <p>Another grey day. This morning Angela did housework and I updated the IET Sussex committee page and the programme page (and pdf version). After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I spent a little time in the garage investigating the TC's fuel pump. I checked the continuity of the coil and the voltage being applied to it. However, it was too cold (in spite of it being about 3 degrees) to stay in the garage for long.</p>
        <p>Yesterday we could not get a TV signal for channel 101 (BBC 1, South) and today channel 102 wouldn't work. Tomorrow I will try to retune all channels. The problem is, all channels are deleted first!</p>
