        <h1>Sunday 29th January</h1>
        <p>A day spent trying to progress a collection (well two) problems. While Angela was at church I read the paper and investigated the fuel pump further. I removed the capacitor (which I thought may have failed closed circuit), but it made no difference. While the points blade was off I cleaned that side of the points some more, although I couldn't reach the other side of the points. I also found that there was continuity across the points even when they were open. So I searched for fault-finding guides, watched a YouTube video and saw that the person was more aggressive with the cleaning. So next I must disconnect the positive lead and try again. I must also find some coarser emery cloth.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Paul at around the usual time, but didn't speak with Victoria until after dinner. Earlier in the afternoon I started looking at converting a jpeg file to the form needed by my neural network. The Pillow library, a fork of PIL library (Python Image Library) has only been tested on Python 3, so I installed it, but when I tried to import one of libraries it said that the processor was of the wrong type!</p>
