        <h1>Friday 27th January</h1>
        <p>The morning was surprisingly sunny, although still chilly. I went into the garage briefly to check the electrical continuity across the fuel pump's points. They appeared to be conducting. I cleaned them some more with emery paper, but still no operation of the pump. There wasn't enough room to get a needle file between the points.</p>
        <p>Then we set off for Petworth. Actually to the Badgers, a couple of miles out of Petworth, where the WSMGOC pub run was meeting. Most people were there by the time we arrived, there being 26 people in total. Angela had whole plaice, which took some effort, but I had a venison steak, which was good and probably amounted to my weekly allowance of meat. We got home at about 3:15. It was cloudy by then.</p>
