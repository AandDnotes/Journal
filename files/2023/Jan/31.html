        <h1>Tuesday 31st January</h1>
        <p>Finally the last day of January. It has seemed a long month. But it was another dry and slightly warmer day. I emailed Julie about the letter of thanks to Hamish, but then our bin store, or at least the parts of it, arrived quite early. It was quite a large pallet. I unpacked the pallet to check that all the pieces were there (they were) and spent the rest of the morning breaking apart the pallet, with the aim of using some pieces under the store as I put it together. After lunch I removed nails from those parts I want to use and bent the nails on those bits that will go to the tip.</p>
        <p>Later I discovered that the fuel pump on the TC is of the older type. I had assumed that it was replaced during the renovation once it was back in the UK. Peter Cole explained how to tell the difference, since he currently only has kits (if needed) for the older type.</p>
        <p>I also spent just a little time trying to find out about the format of bitmap images.</p>
