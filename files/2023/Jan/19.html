        <h1>Thursday 19th January</h1>
        <p>A busy day, but not everything went to plan. For the second day running the west-bound A27 was closed between Shoreham and Lancing due to ice. So the other roads were gridlocked. There didn't seem to be a way of going south from Steyning. It was our shopping day, so we decided to wait a while before venturing out. We also had a Sainsbury's voucher for £7.50, so we decided that going to Portslade was best. It also meant that we could start with a coffee.</p>
        <p>Getting there was fine, but they had closed their cafe! Then, to use the voucher we had to spend £50 or more. So I bought a bottle of gin to make sure we were over the amount. But when we got to the till it turned out that spirits did not count and we were a few pounds light! We got home at about 12:30. Before we had left I put my blood pressure measurements into a spreadsheet (with a graph).</p>
        <p>Yesterday I emailed the supplier of our stainless steel house numbers about them separating from the fixings. They replied today and said I could sen them back for fixing. So I removed the remaining fixings, packaged up the two numbers and took them to the Post Office. We will see what happens. I also emailed the probate office, but it is anyone's guess when I will get a reply.</p>
