        <h1>Monday 9th January</h1>
        <p>We set off reasonably early to the church hall so that Angela could start setting up for the lunch club. I went on to the pharmacy to pick up my repeat prescription. There was a queue at the health centre and I'd forgotten to take a mask, so I phoned the prescription team when I got home. They had heard nothing from Dr Hatrick and suggested that I call the cardiology department at Worthing. So I called his secretary (via the main switchboard), but had to leave a message. Later in the afternoon she phoned back and had pulled my report out of the queue and has sent it for approval. The health centre will get an email, but I can only receive a letter.</p>
        <p>I went back to the church for lunch. I was the delayed Christmas lunch and was very good. As usual, I helped clear up afterwards and Angela was home about half an hour after me.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. I won a raffle prize of a set of second-hand paperback books.</p>
