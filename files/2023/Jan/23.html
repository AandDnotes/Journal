        <h1>Monday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>Angela usually wakes up before 7:30, but this morning it was eight o'clock before she woke. It was another clear, cold morning with a heavy frost, although it had become cloudy and the frost cleared by early afternoon.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her exercise group and I ordered a fuel pipe and transil (for the fuel pump) for the MG. Angela had tried to wash away spilt milk on the front path, but the water had frozen. So I was surprised to find that the water had melted. It seems that Angela had put some road salt on it before she went out. So I just swept the water away. Then I read the paper.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I worked on my AI project. I made a little progress, but ran into another problem.</p>
