        <h1>Sunday 8th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I scanned some cottage photos and added them, with some text, to my cottage web site. She brought the frozen, cooked turkey home to defrost for tomorrow. Luckily it stayed dry until she got home, then it rained for the rest of the day!</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke briefly with Paul. Otherwise we spent quite some time reading the paper and watching TV.</p>
