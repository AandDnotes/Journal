        <h1>Saturday 7th January</h1>
        <p>As expected it was damp this morning, but not too bad as we set off for the High Street. To our surprise, the monthly market had been moved indoors to the Athletic Club. Angela took some recycling and then we went on to the Coop, with more recycling and to buy a paper and some rolls.</p>
        <p>It continued raining on and off for the rest of the day, with a very heavy shower later in the day. I did the weekly accounts and ordered two phone covers. I also uploaded the pdf version of the updated IET Sussex programme 'booklet'. After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Luckily she was taking the children to one of Austin's friends for the day, so we had to stop.</p>
