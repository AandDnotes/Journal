        <h1>Tuesday 24th January</h1>
        <p>A much greyer day. In fact it was cloudy all day, but therefore it was a frost-free start to the day. I didn't venture out before lunch, although Angela went to the High Street, particularly to the butchers. I renewed one of Angela's savings bonds and created the Adestra email to remind members about the next talk, sending the image to Mark for the Twitter and LinkedIn posts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleaned the dried mud off my walking boots, inspected the whip trees cardboard protectors (tying up one) and started looking at the TC's fuel pump. I removed the top cover and used some fine emery paper to clean the dual points. But the pump did not 'tick' when I turned on the ignition! I spent some time researching the construction of the pump. It looks from my photos as though the points are open, which implies that the diaphragm is stuck or disconnected from the rocker. I hope that is not the case.</p>
