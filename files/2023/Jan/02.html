        <h1>Monday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>Today was a bank holiday; not that it affects us, but most other people were not at work. And is was sunny for most of the day.</p>
        <p>I started by paying my SRFC membership fee and Angela did a little tidying in the front garden. Then, before lunch we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe. It took about an hour and a quarter.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we had a long FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. Then I updated my 'journal' html file to give access to months and days in 2023.</p>
