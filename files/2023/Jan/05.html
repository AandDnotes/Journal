        <h1>Thursday 5th January</h1>
        <p>As often happens on a Thursday, we spent all morning shopping. We parked in Waitrose in Worthing and walked to the shops to buy a walking pole and some socks. I enquired about a jell cover for my phone in two shops. The first wanted £10 and the second didn't seem able to find a clear one and reduced the price from £10 to £6, but I decided to buy one online (£2.50 including delivery). We then went back to Waitrose for coffee and to do the weekly grocery shop.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the afternoon replying to IET email and realised that I had updated the programme blog page, but hadn't updated the pdf file. I must do that tomorrow. I also realised that I hadn't finished reading Saturday's newspaper and only had one day left to do so.</p>
        <p>The January issue of Main Gear arrived in the post today. Again it seems that there was no space for either of the articles that I have sent to Roger.</p>
