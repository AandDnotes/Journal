        <h1>Sunday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>Yet another cold and frosty start to the day. It seemed heavier this morning. Angela went off to to church and I read articles about restoring fuel pumps. Then I did some research on bin stores. Later in the day I ordered one. If I had bought materials to build one (without lids) it would have cost just over £200. The one I ordered cost £350.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Paul et al at around our usual time. It seems that Freda does not have arthritis, but has been put on a long-term pain relief for her stiff joints. Shortly afterwards Angela went to a joint-churches event at the Methodist church, getting home at about 9:30.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time looking at my AI project, but didn't make any progress.</p>
