        <h1>Thursday 26th January</h1>
        <p>Mainly due to the travel difficulties created by the flooding on the A27 between Shoreham and Lancing, we decided to go to Holmbush to do the weekly shop. We started by doing the majority of the food shopping in Tesco (because it was cheaper than in M&S) before we had coffee and finished off in Marks. We were home in time to do our Dutch lessons before lunch.</p>
        <p>After lunch I joined an IET talk on AI. It was good, although wide ranging and so only provided an overview. It was then time to sort out the Freesat box. Luckily, by re-tuning, BBC 1 re-appeared. I changed the postcode while I was at it.</p>
