        <h1>Sunday 25th June</h1>
        <p>We had a 'stay nearby' day today. This morning we drove to the next nearest park, Columbia, in the centre of Berkley Heights (if it has a centre). It was hot and humid and the children didn't really want to go, so they played for a short while in the playground and then walked around the edge of the park. Then Victoria and Juniper stayed at the park to wait for a 'girl scouts' friend and the rest of us came home. We then had a FaceTime call with Paul and Rowan before lunch.</p>
        <p>We had a couple of thunder storms and we played some games before a roast beef dinner.</p>
