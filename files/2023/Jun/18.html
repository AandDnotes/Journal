        <h1>Sunday 18th June</h1>
        <p>I had a slight sore throat last night and woke up this morning with a worse throat and a headache. I took a COVID test just in case (and was negative). So I took a couple of paracetamol.</p>
        <p>We tried out Juniper's kite in the garden. It worked better than expected, although there was not enough of a consistent wind.</p>
        <p>After lunch we were driven to 'Jockey Hollow' and walked around a path (for about 2.5 miles). On the way home we stopped in Summit at Magic Fountain for some ice creams, although Austin had a 'slush', Brandon had a chocolate covered banana and Victoria eat a lot of Juniper's huge chocolate cone (with chocolate chips and sprinkles).</p>
        <p>While we were out they left some steak cooking in a sous vide pan. When we got home they just seared the steak, cut it up and put it on top of a huge pile of salad. We then planned our trip to Liberty in the morning.</p>
