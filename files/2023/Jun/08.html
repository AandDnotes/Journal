        <h1>Thursday 8th June</h1>
        <p>It was weekly shopping day and since I wanted to buy some suitcase straps to help prevent our cases from springing apart whilst negotiating baggage handling we decided to go on from Lyons Farm to Range. I had looked on their web site and they had just what we wanted. Also, for some time now I had wanted to look at their range of picture frames, to see if I could use them for my remaining pieces of artwork in the study. So we went to Sainsbury's and then on to Range. They didn't have the straps and their frames were all the wrong sizes (at least for my pictures). And there was a very long queue at the checkout.</p>
        <p>So we went home, without even having some coffee.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed Blay Whitby about the PEI group and then wrote a blog about the BCS talk that I went to yesterday evening. Then I 'scrubbed' weeds off the drive.</p>
