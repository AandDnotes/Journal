        <h1>Friday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>A quiet and mainly rainy day. We were up fairly early, feeling a bit better. Brandon spent all morning cleaning his brewing kit and preparing to make new beer. Victoria went to the supermarket to buy food to last through until Monday. We spent a lot of the morning doing the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was much of the same, although it stopped raining, so Angela and I went for a walk around the neighbourhood. We had 'jerk chicken' for dinner.</p>
        <p>The children spent most of the day watching TV programmes or playing video games.</p>
