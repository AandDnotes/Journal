        <h1>Wednesday 21st June</h1>
        <p>We had a good start by going to a waterfall, about half an hours drive away. Initially we walked the wrong way (up a steep hill) then discovered that we had missed the turn and it was only a couple of hundred yards.</p>
        <p>However, then things went a little wrong. We went to a cafe that was listed as serving gluten free food, but they had closed their cafe and just supplied others. We couldn't find anywhere else that was open, so we came home and eat what was there. Then we went to a park in the next town. Juniper played on the climbing equipment and we tried flying the two kites. Again there was too little wind.</p>
        <p>Then we collected Chinese takeaway on the way back to the chalet.</p>
