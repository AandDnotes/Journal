        <h1>Monday 19th June</h1>
        <p>We set off at about 10:30 to drive initially up to a town (New Platz) near the 'walk across the Hudson' bridge. We went to a restaurant for lunch because they advertised several gluten-free options for Austin. However, they only had a gluten-free bun into which they could put a cheese burger. Also, we had to wait an hour since two large parties had just arrived. The food wasn't very good. Anyway, we then drove to the walkway, which was about 1.25 miles long and had been a railway bridge. It was a long, hot walk over and back, so we stopped for ice cream afterwards.</p>
        <p>We found that we were further away from Liberty (where Victoria had rented a cabin) than we thought. It took just over an hour, but it was a nice location and a spacious cabin. Angela and I went for a short walk (as if we hadn't walked enough today) after dinner.</p>
