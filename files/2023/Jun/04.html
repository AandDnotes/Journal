        <h1>Sunday 4th June</h1>
        <p>Another relatively quiet day, but one with clear blue sky fro sunrise to sunset. While Angela went to church I tried to renew our house insurance, but the Saga website refused to cooperate. So I cleaned a pair of shoes that I want to take away with us and fitted some insoles. Then I read the booklet on Van Gogh Alive.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria and with Paul. I spent some time trying to find out something about where she had booked a cabin in the Catskill Mountains for us during our visit. Later still, I spoke with Alan. They had a good holiday in Italy and have pencilled in a visit to us for the South Downs Run.</p>
