        <h1>Saturday 17th June</h1>
        <p>A more gentle day. After a fairly late breakfast of French toast we took a drive to the Berkley Heights municipal building, which has the library. The children changed their books, although Austin borrowed mainly 'graphic novels'.</p>
        <p>After lunch Brandon and I looked at his brew equipment controller that he was making. Eventually we worked out the correct connections, although he still needs to work out how to configure some parts of the brew control application.</p>
        <p>I spent some time searching for somewhere to visit on Monday on our way to the Catskills. Then, after dinner we went for a walk around the neighbourhood again.</p>
