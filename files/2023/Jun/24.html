        <h1>Saturday 24th June</h1>
        <p>Although the morning started a little wet, it stopped raining as we went out and became quite warm and humid. We set off just after ten and went to the Edison Museum in West Orange (north west of Berkley Height, but still in New Jersey).</p>
        <p>There was a lot to see there and we heard a couple of talks, but it wasn't really of interest to the children. So we went off to Montclair for a pizza lunch (the did gluten free pizzas). On our way home we visited Eagle Rock and went for a walk in the forest. We missed the view point (over New York), but it was a misty day anyway.</p>
        <p>When we got home Victoria and Juniper finished the cake they had made and we finished the jigsaw puzzle. Angela helped Victoria plant out some seedlings and then we had a charcuterie dinner, after which Juniper decorated the cake and we had some for desert.</p>
