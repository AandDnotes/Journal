        <h1>Thursday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>It seems that yesterday was the longest day of 2023, the summer solstice. Today seemed long because we were up before six o'clock, showered, breakfasted, packed and left the chalet by 9:30. We had decided to drive straight back to Berkley Heights and not try to visit anywhere en route. However, I kept my eyes closed for most of the way on the freeways due to Brandon's driving: Much too fast and much to close to the vehicle in front. Quite apart from the lane weaving to overtake slower vehicles.</p>
        <p>We got back at eleven. After a lunch of re-heated Chinese food, Brandon went off to the 'beer shop' and then we all walked to the local park. Before dinner we started a jigsaw puzzle; a stylistic painting of New York city, from Central Park south. We continued during and after dinner, but didn't get very far.</p>
