        <h1>Friday 30th June</h1>
        <p>We arrived in Iceland (at Heflevik airport) at around five local time, but in the early hours for us. I had watched a film en route (Long Story Short), Angela had read. We had an hour before our flight to Gatwick was due, so we ate our fruit and muffins. Although the queues at the gate looked chaotic, boarding was straight forward. Unfortunately, the Captain then said that UK air traffic control had stoped them from leaving, so we sat on the tarmac for an hour! Luckily it was another large plane (on the way out it had been a small plane with no seat-back screens), so I was able to watch another film, an odd one called 'The French Dispatch'. Angela again read. So we were about an hour late arriving at Gatwick at one o'clock. However, we were out with our bags by half past and only had to wait a few minutes for the taxi driver. So we were home by two thirty.</p>
        <p>Although we didn't really know what day it was, let alone the time or what meal was next, we had some cheese and biscuits and then Angela went to the High Street to get enough to get us through to the morning.</p>
