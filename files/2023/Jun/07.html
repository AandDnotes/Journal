        <h1>Wednesday 7th June</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day. Angela started by going out with the (ex) WI walking group. They caught the bus to Shoreham and walked back along the river. I compiled a note about our IET Sussex social media analytics and sent it to Steve and Kosidinna, with my apologies for the meeting.</p>
        <p>I also started 'pruning' the files on the iMac and looked at part of my AI presentation. Then I went off to Falmer to a BCS talk on AI. I met the chair of the Sussex BCS, but the talk was given by a philosopher, about ethics associated with AI.</p>
