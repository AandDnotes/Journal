        <h1>Friday 16th June</h1>
        <p>Another day of travelling. We started early with a walk to South Station, with our cases. We had breakfast, bought some lunch and caught the 10:15 Amtrack train to New York, where we arrived just after 2:30. Whereas it was sunny when we left Boston, it was raining when we got to New York. We only had to cross 8th Avenue to get to Pen Station, but we got our cagoules out of our cases.</p>
        <p>We then caught a New Jersey Transit train to Summit. I sent text messages to Victoria, but didn't know if they got through. Then, when I tried a voice call, the phone said that I had reached my 'cap'! Luckily my text message had got through and they were waiting at Summit station.</p>
        <p>After dinner we went for a walk around the neighbourhood, a very manicured one.</p>
