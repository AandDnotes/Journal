        <h1>Friday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>Quite a tiring, but enjoyable day. We went off on the bus to Brighton to see the Van Gogh Alive exhibition. We were in the Corn Exchange (part of Brighton Dome) for an hour. I took quite a lot of photos. We then had lunch in Waterstones, looked for Lakeland in Churchill Square (but it had gone) and bought some small items in a 'Danish' shop.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the bus journey to Brighton was very slow and the return quite quick. Today the opposite was true. The journey home was quite tiring. We got home at 3:45.</p>
