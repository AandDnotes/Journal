        <h1>Monday 12th June</h1>
        <p>Today's main activity was 'lunch club'. Angela went off before I had finished in the bathroom and then got home at about three. I did some packing, then went to the Post Office for some cash before going to the lunch club.</p>
        <p>When we got home it was a case of 'checking in' for our flights tomorrow. I also printed our boarding passes, although having them on my phone would be enough, and I looked up prices of head-torches and tool bags. It looks as though B&amp:Q are best for both. After trying to finish off our remaining food for our tea, Angela sorted out her plants and I started turning off things like the boiler and the iMac.</p>
