        <h1>Tuesday 6th June</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went to do some weeding at the church. I emailed a reminder to the PEI group and later made some changes to the PEI distribution list. I also spent some time looking at the files on the iMac that are not backed up. There are too many to simply upload to existing or new cloud services. So I will need to delete what is not needed, but that is a big job.</p>
        <p>In the early evening I joined the IET workshop on EngX. In fact, I was the main event. It seemed to go quite well.</p>
