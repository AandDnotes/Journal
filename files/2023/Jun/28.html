        <h1>Wednesday 28th June</h1>
        <p>We had a bit of a lie-in this morning. So it was late before we had breakfast and lunch. Juniper had a swimming lesson at 4:10, so after lunch we drove to Summit. We parked near the station, had a little walk around (much to Juniper's disgust), found a good ice cream shop (which she liked) and then walked to the swimming pool. We sat in the foyer while Juniper had her half hour lesson.</p>
