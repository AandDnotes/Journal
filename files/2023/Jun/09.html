        <h1>Friday 9th June</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day, but noticeably warmer. We started by taking the TC to Camelia Botnar for coffee, a 21 mile run in all. It went well, although there is still a slight petrol leak that seems to be coming from the hold-up bolts. I might need to put a spot of thread-lock on the the next time that I tighten them. It was nearly lunchtime by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>Whilst putting up the hood I managed to straighten (almost) the nearside wing-bolt. So it now screws in easily.</p>
        <p>Having said that Deshi could use the event slot that had been reserved for an ADSC talk, I received an email from Daniel saying that a professor from Imperial College had agreed the date! So I had to email Dave (and Deshi). I also updated Dave's spreadsheet and sent a copy to Deshi, pointing out that there was still one slot without a speaker. I also emailed Daniel to ask for a title and synopsis.</p>
        <p>The new suitcase straps arrived and I adjusted them for our two cases. I also assembled my toolkit for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
