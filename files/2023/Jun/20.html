        <h1>Tuesday 20th June</h1>
        <p>With some revised information from the cabin owner we were able to get on the wi-fi.</p>
        <p>We had planned to have a quieter day, staying near the cabin. So we started by driving to a park, just up the road. After much complaint from Juniper, we walked along one of the paths to a viewpoint (without a lot of a view) and back. Then we went on to a supermarket to buy food for lunch and dinner.</p>
        <p>We had planned to go out in the afternoon, but it started raining (for a short while). So we spent the afternoon playing games.</p>
