        <h1>Thursday 29th June</h1>
        <p>The plan was to go out at ten. However, we managed to get out by eleven and went to the 'Great Swamp', starting at the visitor centre. We walked around two short trails, the first, shorter one with, information boards, and then a half mile trail. Through the visitor centre window we saw humming birds.</p>
        <p>After lunch (back home) we packed. Brandon got home in time to take us to the airport. It was a terrifying journey, luckily only about 35 minutes long. The road network has lanes coming and going in all directions and Brandon drives too fast and too close to the vehicle in front. Angela kept her eyes closed for most of the way.</p>
        <p>We soon found the Icelandair desks, checked our cases and obtained boarding cards. Then it was security, which was busy but did not take long. We had a meal in an Italian restaurant inside the terminal and bought some food to eat on the journey. The flight to Iceland was a little delayed due to a late arrival, but that did not cause any problem.</p>
        <p>To be continued.</p>
