        <h1>Sunday 11th June</h1>
        <p>It seems that today is both Kate's and Archie's birthday. Sunny for most of the morning, then cloudy (with one or two spots of rain) and then a clear evening. Not as hot as yesterday, but still quite warm.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I went through more photos (and other documents) on the iMac, deleting a few, but still leaving most. Although the total of the files on the hard drive is small enough to fit on to a new (large) iMac SSD, there are still too many to back up.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we started putting out things to pack and then spoke firstly to Victoria and then to Paul.</p>
