        <h1>Tuesday 13th June</h1>
        <p>A (very) long and tiring day. The taxi arrived just after nine and took us to Gatwick. Still no rain. It was good that we were early, since there was a only a small queue at the checkin/bag-drop desk, although it was difficult to find the Iceland Air desk, since the signs didn't go up until three hours before the departure time. Getting through security was straightforward, so we had coffee, bought a couple of Boots meal deals and then just sat and 'people watched'. The flight to Iceland was on time and took just over three hours. We were surprised to be given a cheese and salad croissant as well as coffee.</p>
        <p>We were bussed from the plane to the terminal building at Keflavik and there was really only time to have a quick walk around and go to the loo before we were asked to queue for the gate. As Victoria had said, there are multiple queues for various gates, all next to each other.</p>
        <p>From Iceland to Boston as the longer part of the journey (about five and a half hours), but everything was on time. This was a larger plane and had a seat-back entertainment system. I watched 'Empire of Light' and Angela continued reading her book. No food this time, so we ate one of our sandwiches.</p>
        <p>We landed pretty much on time and the queue through passport control wasn't too bad. For some reason we didn't need to give our finger prints. Our cases had been taken off the carousel by the time that we got into baggage claim, so it was straight out. Then we were slightly lost. When I asked a bus driver he just said follow him. We boarded a Blue Line bus and got off at the T station. We then got the subway train to the Aquarium stop and our hotel was just across the road. We were in our room on the 8th (top) floor by 8:30. We went for a walk to find a cafe, but there were only bars, pubs and restaurants, so we bought some hot chocolate and a muffin from the 7-11 next door and took those back to our room. Then went to bed (at 3:30am UK time).</p>
