        <h1>Wednesday 14th June</h1>
        <p>Another tiring day, but a good one. We were up fairly early and had an expensive breakfast in the restaurant attached to the hotel. We then set off to Boston Common and the start of the Freedom Trail. We walked its entire length. It was only the stretch over to Charlestown and up to the Bunker Hill monument that was difficult. Luckily we were able to catch the ferry from the naval dockyard to Long Wharf for the return. We had a late lunch in Quincy Market, spent the rest of the afternoon in the hotel and then went to a restaurant just around the corner for dinner. There was a thunderstorm while we were there, but it had stopped by the time we wanted to leave.</p>
