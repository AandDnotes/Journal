        <h1>Thursday 1st June</h1>
        <p>My 75th birthday! So we went out to do our usual weekly grocery shop!</p>
        <p>After coffee in Waitrose (Angela had another money-off voucher) we went to Boots at Lyons Farm, initially just to get some sun cream. However, I bought some insoles and we both bought a new pair of polaroid sun glasses. So we signed up for a Boots card and got 10% off.</p>
        <p>Later we decided to visit the Van Gogh Alive exhibition in Brighton tomorrow. So I booked tickets (and a booklet).</p>
        <p>I also tidied up the notes on my AI project and then created a slide set (just three slides) for the workshop next Tuesday. I used an IET template and needed to do a lot of adjustment to my web diagram.</p>
