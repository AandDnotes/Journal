        <h1>Monday 5th June</h1>
        <p>Another day of unbroken sunshine and perhaps just a little warmer. Angela went to her exercise group and I walked down to the High Street to buy dollars, get some cash and find some rolls. In my light sweater I was quite warm by the time I got home.</p>
        <p>The Saga we site would still not let me renew our home insurance, so I had to phone them and wait in the queue for ten minutes. But it was all done successfully. later I emailed Colin Cunningham to ask if he would run the PEI Group meeting next week.</p>
        <p>Angela wanted to check that she had turned off everything at the church this morning, so we went for a walk, coming back via the cricket field. Again, quite warm in a light sweater.</p>
