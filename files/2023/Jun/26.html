        <h1>Monday 26th June</h1>
        <p>Brandon left early for work this morning, which meant that we were awake at about six, getting up at seven. Victoria took us to Kohl's and Target to get Juniper some dresses and both children some flip-flops. Juniper also bought a large, felt hat!</p>
        <p>That took all morning and Brandon was home at around 2:30, continuing to work at home. I added more to my visit web site and Victoria made bread (in the machine), banana bread (that we had for desert) and then tortillas for dinner.</p>
