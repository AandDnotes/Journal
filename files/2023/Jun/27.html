        <h1>Tuesday 27th June</h1>
        <p>Since Brandon was working from home today and had an (online) interview around lunchtime, the rest of us went out. Victoria had booked tickets for the 'Liberty Science Centre' in Jersey City. They had been there before and thought it an interesting place, particularly on a rainy day.</p>
        <p>Our tickets were for 10:30, so we set off at about ten to ten and followed the sat nav on a torturous route to the Science Centre. It was an interesting building, with interesting content, mainly aimed at children, with a lot of interactive exhibits. We had lunch in an overcrowded cafe, explored more of the Centre and got home (via a simpler route) just after 2:30.</p>
        <p>We had eaten lunch early, as had Brandon, so we went to a restaurant in Berkley Heights fairly early for dinner, since it was Brandon's birthday. It was a good meal.</p>
