        <h1>Saturday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>A quieter day. We made our usual trip to the High Street to buy a newspaper, also bought melon (Waitrose had none on Thursday) and some cream to have with strawberries. Angela also bought a pepper on the farmers market.</p>
        <p>I was expecting to go out again to view more venues on the Art Trail, but Angela worked in the garden and I did the weekly accounts and started the monthly ones.</p>
        <p>After lunch we did go out. We started in Goring Road, which was had an interesting wood turner, and then moved on to Bramber Road, Charlton Street and the High Street. We got home at about 4:30. Although it had been cool this morning, the afternoon was quite warm.</p>
