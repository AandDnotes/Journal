        <h1>Thursday 15th June</h1>
        <p>We started by walking to a cafe that was part of a chain we had used in Davis. However, it appeared to be shut, so we walked around the corner to the 'Bean &amp; Leaf'. It turned out that the first cafe's main entrance was around the corner, so it was probably open. However, the Bean &amp; Leaf was very good. In fact, we went back there for some lunch.</p>
        <p>We then walked along the 'green way' to South Station, deciding that we could walk that way in the morning with our cases. Having looked in the station we caught the T to Harvard and did a tour (self guided) around the old part of the campus.</p>
        <p>Later we walked around the harbour. Quite an interesting walk.</p>
