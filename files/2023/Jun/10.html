        <h1>Saturday 10th June</h1>
        <p>Blue sky from sunrise to sunset, but much warmer and no sign of the forecast thunder storms. The water butts are nearly empty!</p>
        <p>We walked (slowly) to the High Street this morning to buy a newspaper and some rolls and then Angela pottered in the garden while I did the weekly accounts. I had a bank statement to reconcile against my accounts, but ended up 45 pence short! In the end I just made a correction to my reconciliation sheet. It is where I include unclaimed payments and so is full of 'corrections' so as to make my accounts and what is in the bank actually balance.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I went off to the Repair Cafe in Beeding. In spite of the hot weather we were quite busy. Luckily there were plenty of repairers.</p>
