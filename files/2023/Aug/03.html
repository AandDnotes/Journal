        <h1>Thursday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>Rather than do the weekly supermarket shop we had quite a different day. Luckily it was dry and occasionally sunny. Since Rowan's foot was still hurting (although improving) we didn't want to do too much walking. So we went swimming! Paul drove to Splash Point. Rowan, Paul and I went in and Krista and Angela walked into Worthing.</p>
        <p>We had a good swim; it is a good facility, with two pools (plus a divided off part with the diving boards). We spent about an hour in the pools.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we walked around the corner and had lunch at Perch Pizza. We sat outside and had good pizzas. The rest of the afternoon was spent sitting in our garden.</p>
