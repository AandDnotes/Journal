        <h1>Monday 7th August</h1>
        <p>I started the day by phoning the prescription team to find out why my tablets were not at the pharmacy. It seems that 'next issue date' really means the date from which I can put in a request! They said that they would send a request to the pharmacy for a batch of two, this one and the next and I should be able to collect them later. When later came, I found that they had put a brand name on the prescription, which was not in stock, so they had to be ordered. The pharmacy will call me when they arrive.</p>
        <p>Paul then drove us to Shoreham and we caught the 700 bus to Brighton. We walked around the Royal Pavilion gardens, the Lanes and the sea-front (where we had lunch). We got home just before four (with even more stones).</p>
