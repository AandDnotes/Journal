        <h1>Thursday 24th August</h1>
        <p>A wet day. In fact we had a thunder storm starting just as the window cleaner had finished! We did our usual weekly shop at Lyons Farm and then went on to Rogers Farm for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I finished putting the Dyson back together. And it works! So I phoned the owner, who will collect it on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Then I finished producing the 2023/24 events blog page (as well as the pdf version). I'd had an email from Joe Dunn (Solent Network) who was trying to do what I had done, but had them rejected as not being blogs. So we will see what happens to my 'blog'.</p>
        <p>During the evening I spoke with Alan. He is looking forward to the South Downs Run and Chris is happy to go to Eastbourne by bus. They will arrive on Saturday afternoon.</p>
