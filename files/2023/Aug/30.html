        <h1>Wednesday 30th August</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela went off walking with the walking group. They just went around the lower horseshoe. After updating one of my TC web pages and printing off a map of Eastbourne and bus timetable, I also went for a walk. Just for half an hour.</p>
        <p>I then spent the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon removing the 'skeleton' of the dead bush in the front garden. I had to cut off the roots so as to get the base out. It was quite hard work and involved using a fork, trowel, loppers, axe and bow saw. We put what we could in the garden bin, but are left with the stump.</p>
        <p>Alan phoned to say that Laura's dog was ill and they were waiting for test results to see if it would be safe to leave Boo with her over the weekend. If they can't leave Boo then he will come on his own.</p>
        <p>Then I updated the remaining TC pages before transcribing another day's notes from my Indian diary.</p>
