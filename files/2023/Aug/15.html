        <h1>Tuesday 15th August</h1>
        <p>It was a day of starting things, but not quite finishing them. I could detect no leak from the front carburettor on the TC, but the rear one was still leaking, so I ordered a new set of washers (four for each carb) and left the job until they arrive. Then I tried the cleaned filter assembly on the 'Repair Cafe' Dyson vacuum cleaner, but it still wouldn't run. So I started dismantling it, only to find, as expected, that the outside screws were Phillips, but those inside were torx (hexalobular internal). So I cleaned out the dust, but had to leave it until my set of screwdriver heads arrives.</p>
        <p>Even Angela's jobs did not all get completed. She walked to the High Street, but forgot to buy some fruit (we only had one apple left). So I went for a walk during the afternoon and bought some. Otherwise, Angela cut back a lot of the hedge between us and Lynn. I did, however, get my TC4985 web site replicated on its own site (actually a github Pages site called djsmgs). I found that there was a facility to copy an existing repository, so it was quite easy. I can now use this to give potential purchasers access to all my information about the car.</p>
