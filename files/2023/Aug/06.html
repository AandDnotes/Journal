        <h1>Sunday 6th August</h1>
        <p>A generally fine, sunny day. We started by walking to Bramber castle and then, following a 'Pokemon' route to Steyning. Rowan found/captured/collected Pokemon on the way using her phone. We went to the cafe in xxx for a drink. They were a bit slow with the service, but it coffee was good.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria et al, who are in Missouri. Claudia, Victoria and the children were about to drive south to visit a 'western' theme park, staying in a hotel tonight and tomorrow before driving back.</p>
        <p>Paul et al then drove to Lancing to visit a friend who lives in a flat overlooking Beach Green. While they were out Angela cooked a New York style cheesecake and roasted a chicken for dinner. I put some bread on to cook and then took the TC for a run and to get some petrol. The brakes seemed to pull up in a straight line, so it is now ready for Wednesday's run. Both the chicken and the cheesecake were good.</p>
