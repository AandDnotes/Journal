        <h1>Saturday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our 51st wedding anniversary, but Alan and Chris were the only ones who remembered. And it wasn't a very successful morning. I walked to the farmer's market with some recycling, only to find that today it was being held at the Steyning Centre. So I went to the pharmacy, only to find that my prescription had not been repeated, even though it says that it is on the piece of paper that came with the last lot. I only have one tablet left! So I need to phone them on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Then I bought a newspaper and went to the Steyning Centre. It had been drizzling, but started pouring as I left. So by the time I got to the Methodist church I was very wet. At least I had coffee and cake. When I got home I had to change my trousers and pants!</p>
        <p>Angela stayed a bit longer and Paul et al went out just after I got home. They went off to a pub near Dorking to meet up with some friends. I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried again to get the TC's horn working, without success. So I refitted it to the car, but left the plastic horn connected.</p>
