        <h1>Monday 21st August</h1>
        <p>The day started cloudy, but became sunnier after lunch. While Angela was at her regular Monday get together, the postman brought the washers for the TC's carburettors. So I fitted them (four per carburettor), putting Blue Hylomar on every surface and a spot of thread lock on the bolt. I started the car later and it showed no sign of a leak.</p>
        <p>After lunch we drove to Spring Gardens and picked some Victoria plums and some runner beans. Angela washed, stoned and cut up some and put them in the freezer.</p>
        <p>During the day I set up a web page and started transcribing my notes from my first trip to India. There is a long way to go!</p>
