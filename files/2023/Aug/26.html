        <h1>Saturday 26th August</h1>
        <p>Luckily we got back from a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper just before it started raining. The morning was then pretty wet, although it brightened up after lunch. The owner of the Dyson vacuum cleaner call to collect it, paid me for the parts and left a donation for the Repair Cafe. So I messaged Robin.</p>
        <p>I added Friday's Pub Run to my TC's Outings web page. I then copied the modified files to the specific TC4985 github account. Since I can only be signed in to one account at a time I have to sign out from my main account and sign in to my DJsMGs account.</p>
        <p>The last time that we were out in the Panda I thought that the air flow was not as strong as it used to be. So I did a little investigation into replacing the cabin air filter, but to examine the state of the existing filter I need to have the car out so that I can open the driver's door fully. Every YouTube video showed a different arrangement of panels and access to the filter.</p>
        <p>After lunch I had problems trying to do my usual revision lessons on Duolingo. They have removed the 'button' that I've been using. Then we had a chat with Victoria. That took most of what was left of the afternoon.</p>
