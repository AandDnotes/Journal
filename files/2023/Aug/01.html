        <h1>Tuesday 1st August</h1>
        <p>After a slightly protracted breakfast we all walked down to the park and played with a frizby. Then we went to Victoria Sponge for coffee and went to Budgens to buy a few things for dinner.</p>
        <p>After lunch our plan had been to walk to Bramber Castle, but Rowan stubbed her toe on the threshold of the patio doors. Her toe swelled and she couldn't put weight on the foot. So we stayed in for the afternoon. We worked quite hard to get dinner. Then Krista had a headache and so went to bed.</p>
