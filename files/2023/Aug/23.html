        <h1>Wednesday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking group this morning, catching the bus to Shoreham and then walking back. It was sunny and warm, so several gave up part way and waited for a bus. I spent most of the morning drafting a blog page for the Sussex Network 2023/24 programme of events.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did a little more to the blog page and then we cut out a little more of the dead bush in the front garden. Then Angela found that my package had been delivered. So after a cup of tea I did a little to the Dyson. I managed to get the switch out, replaced the cracked trigger and refitted the switch unit. I found a better video description of the process.</p>
