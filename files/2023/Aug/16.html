        <h1>Wednesday 16th August</h1>
        <p>The morning started a little misty, but the sun soon burned it off and it was sunny all day (with a few clouds). While Angela went off with her walking group, I started painting the bin stores. I'd expected to paint them like the fence, but Angela wanted them green, to match the garden gate. So I spent most of the day (it took longer than I thought) painting the bin store. It was quite tiring.</p>
        <p>The other day I ordered a set of screw drivers, covering Phillips, flat, tri and torx varieties. The set was delivered towards the end of today. So I can now continue to dismantle the Dyson vacuum cleaner.</p>
