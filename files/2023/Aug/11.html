        <h1>Friday 11th August</h1>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the morning working in the Methodist Church garden, joined by Sandie. Meanwhile, I walked to the High Street to get my hair cut. I then brushed down the bin store with the intention of starting to paint it. However, it started to rain just as I was coming in to get lunch.</p>
        <p>Angela was worn out, but I went into the garage and re-made the joints of the float chambers to the carburettor bodies, since both were still leaking a little. I found that the front carb was actually missing one of the fibre washers. I have a lot of old washers, but might need to buy some new ones. I also put a spot of thread lock on the bolts to help them stay in place.</p>
        <p>A little later I cleaned up the damaged spot of paint near the rear, nearside door on the Panda and applied two coats of primer. Now I need to rub it down and put some white paint over it. I also put tools in my tool bag, ready for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
