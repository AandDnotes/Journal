        <h1>Sunday 20th August</h1>
        <p>Apart from putting the vacuum cleaner back together, I didn't do a lot. Angela said that it was quiet on her way home from church. At that time, Spain were ahead, one nil, against England in the World Cup Final. That ended up as the final score. I spent a lot of the morning going through my slides for my AI talk, making a few amendments.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
