        <h1>Friday 18th August</h1>
        <p>After a relatively quick OS update on the iMac I tackled the vibrations from the TV when certain people speak. I removed the back (there were lots of screws) and found that some of the tape holding down cables had come adrift. So I replaced all the tape and screwed the back on. So far, so good!</p>
        <p>It rained for most (all) of the morning, but brightened up at lunchtime. So we went for a walk, across the cricket field and around the lower horseshoe. It was quite warm.</p>
