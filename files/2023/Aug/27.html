        <h1>Sunday 27th August</h1>
        <p>A dry, reasonably warm day, although it helped wearing a thin jumper. Angela went to church as usual on a Sunday and I replied to an IET email. Then I investigated the Panda's cabin air filter. At least, that was the plan. I got the side cover of the central console off (it had one torx self-tapping screw and two allen-key bolts). The filter cover had two screws; the plastic around the lower screw was broken and the upper screw was inaccessible, what with the steering column and the pedals. So I put the side panel back. Perhaps I'll look at it another time. So that was the morning!</p>
        <p>I managed to do my Dutch lessons in the usual way, but had to start by selecting to earn more hearts! Then I cut off more of the dead bush in the front garden. Now I just need to get the roots out! I also added other TC jobs that I had done to my list of updates to my web page. I've not been very diligent.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke to Paul and Rowan. She told us about her axolotis. The female is called Judy and the male Alvin. It seems that she wanted one for her birthday, but Paul found someone in Rotterdam who wanted to sell the tank and all the gubbins, with two axalotis.</p>
