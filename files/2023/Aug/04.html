        <h1>Friday 4th August</h1>
        <p>We needed to do some shopping today, so Angela and Paul walked down to the butchers and then Angela, Krista and I went off to Holmbush. We started with coffee, then went into M&amp;S and then Tesco. Krista bought some clothes for Rowan, since she seems to be growing continually. While we were out, Paul and Rowan went for quite a long walk. Her toe is still slightly swollen, but it does not seem to hurt.</p>
        <p>Consequently we had a late lunch and so a slightly late dinner. Angela cooked a gluten-free 'toad in the hole', which was very good. The only problem was that there was too much!</p>
        <p>There was only a little sunshine, but it stayed dry and it was warm. After dinner, Krista, Paul and Rowan went for a short walk.</p>
