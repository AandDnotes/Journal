        <h1>Thursday 10th August</h1>
        <p>A warm sunny day. Since the shopping list was quite short, we started by going to Waitrose. When we got back I booked the TC in for an MoT test! The person who Simms would prefer to do that is on Holiday, so it is not booked in until the week after next. I just have to hope that there is nothing too serious to rectify, since there will only be two weeks before the South Downs Run.</p>
        <p>We started removing a dying (dead) shrub in the front garden, but half of it filled the garden bin. Angela pottered and I cleared the non-grass weeds from the drive. I also checked to see if I could tighten the rear fixing of the offside front spring. I couldn't move the nuts.</p>
        <p>I also started removing absolute references to other pages of the TC4985 site. My aim is to move it to its own Github site so as to keep it separate from the rest of my sites. </p>
