        <h1>Tuesday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>I was up early this morning to take the TC down to Simms by 8:30 for an MoT test. By ten they had called to say that it had passed! There were two advisories. The first was about a hole in the side-screen box, which I know about and had treated, and the second was play in the ball joint on the offside end of the drag link. This may be due to the springs in the ball joints or may be some wear. So quite a momentous day.</p>
        <p>After cleaning the filters in the vacuum cleaner, Angela had to 'dial down' (actually increase) the closeness of the cleaner to the carpet so as to be able to push it along. The dust bin was very full. I found my photos taken during my first trip to India and spent some time scanning a few and transcribing more notes.</p>
