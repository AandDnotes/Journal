        <h1>Monday 14th August</h1>
        <p>It was a slow start this morning. I started by cleaning the filter on the Dyson vacuum cleaner that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. It might just be that the filter was reducing the air flow and thus stopping the motor. Then I investigated how to replace the trigger as that is a common problem. It is quite a process.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to Lunch Club and I followed later, taking the 'repaired' radio with me to return it to the owner. The lunch club was not very well supported today.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried to set up a new github account to hold the TC's web pages. I don't think I succeeded and couldn't get github Desktop to show the new account.</p>
        <p>After a light tea I took the TC to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. I won a bottle of proseco in the raffle.</p>
