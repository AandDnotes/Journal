        <h1>Tuesday 8th August</h1>
        <p>We were all up just after seven and they were packed and away by nine. It seems that they had a good journey to Dover, arriving one and a half hours early. They were then home at about 6:45 our time.</p>
        <p>We started by putting the study back together and putting the spare chair back in the loft. Angela did a couple of batches of washing, although it was drizzly for most of the day. She also did some cleaning.</p>
        <p>Angela went to library and the High Street and my tablets finally arrived, so I walked to the pharmacy. However, I found that I did actually had one left (for Monday), so now I have to work that back into the sequence.</p>
        <p>The house seems very quiet!</p>
