        <h1>Tuesday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>It rained for most of the day! We had planned to spend the day in Chichester, exploring the cathedral and walking around the walls, before going to the theatre in the evening. However, we decided to stay at home, not doing very much and leaving at four o'clock. Rowan's toe was still hurting, but she was hobbling around. So we walked down to the cathedral cafe for a drink and then went up to the theatre and sat inside until the performance started. Paul had to give Rowan a piggyback for most of the way back.</p>
        <p>We saw 'The Sound of Music', with ice cream in the interval. It was an enjoyable performance and we think that Rowan liked it. We did not get home until eleven o'clock.</p>
