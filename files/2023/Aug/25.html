        <h1>Friday 25th August</h1>
        <p>An excellent day. It was warm(ish), mainly sunny and calm (until later in the afternoon). Angela went down to the church to do half and hour's weeding before we set off to Alford Bars in the TC. We left at eleven and arrived at a quarter to twelve. At that time the only other WSMGOC cur there was a Humber! But soon there were twenty people.</p>
        <p>At the Sir Thomas Tichbourne we all sat out on the terrace, under large umbrellas. Angela had scampi and I had a large pot of muscles. Everything was very good, including the service. We were home just before 3:30 having driven a total of 40 miles. The TC ran well.</p>
        <p>My 'blog page' for the 2023/24 events programme was rejected because it is not a blog! I replied, but late in the day.</p>
