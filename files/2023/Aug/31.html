        <h1>Thursday 31st August</h1>
        <p>The last day of August and it rained for most of the day. After talking with Alan we decided to do the weekly shop. Laura's dog is much better, but the vet is still doing test. They explored kennels, but they were full, so if necessary, Chris will stay at home.</p>
        <p>We went to Lidl in Shoreham and did our whole shop. We then went to Dunelm to look at kettles. After coffee we found that they didn't have much choice and they were expensive. So we decided to look elsewhere.</p>
        <p>After lunch I had an invite to a meeting with Lisa re EngX and emailed Joe in the Solent Network to update him. Angela went for a short walk, but I stayed home in case Alan phoned. He didn't.</p>
