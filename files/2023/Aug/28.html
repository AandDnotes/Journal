        <h1>Monday 28th August</h1>
        <p>A good day until mid afternoon. I spent most of the morning in the garage after taking the TC for a run to get petrol. With the engine warm I checked the valve clearance (I didn't need to adjust any), cleaned and checked the points and the plugs. I had thought of checking the timing, but the pinch bolt is difficult to access and the car is running well, so I left it. I did take it for another test run after topping up the oil, checking the water and the tyre pressures.</p>
        <p>Angela had cut the front grass and so after making a cup of tea, she went to the garage to check if the batteries had recharged. She said there was no power and, in fact, the whole of the power was off. We assumed that there was a power cut and so Angela went to the High Street to buy something for dinner that didn't need cooking.</p>
        <p>Then we discovered that everyone else had power. So I checked the circuit breakers and thought they were all up and showing red. So I turned off the main switch, but then it wouldn't go back up. I pushed it quite hard, but was afraid of breaking it. I tried calling Mark Perry, but he didn't answer. So I phoned an emergency service in Checkatrade. It was expensive and charged by the half hour.</p>
        <p>We had dinner and read until it started getting dark. Then the electrician arrived at about 8:15. It seemed that I was not pushing the main switch hard enough. So he just turned everything on! Angela put the kettle on to make him a cup of tea and all the power went off! A spare kettle worked.</p>
        <p>It seems that the company is nation wide, with a call centre in Southend and the man came from Peacehaven.</p>
