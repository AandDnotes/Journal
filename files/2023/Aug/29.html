        <h1>Tuesday 29th August</h1>
        <p>A dry, but mainly cloudy day. I spent most of the morning in the garage, 'wiping over' the TC and then applying wax. This included removing the spare wheel. I also put some furniture wax on the dashboard. So the car is now ready for the South Downs Run on Sunday.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to Anita's funeral, taking Gill. They came back for a cup of tea just before four, just after I had come in from the garage. I then updated my TC4985 web site for relining the front brake shoes and the bonnet prop. I also managed to copy the modified files to my DJsMGs account.</p>
