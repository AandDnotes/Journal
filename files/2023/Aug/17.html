        <h1>Thursday 17th August</h1>
        <p>A mainly sunny day, with a little mist early morning and some cloud through lunchtime. We started at Lyons Farm to do our weekly supermarket shop and then went on to Rogers Farm for coffee. They are about to change ownership and so are running down their stock. Consequently they had no bulbs, which meant that we went on to Squires to buy some.</p>
        <p>After lunch I dismantled the rest of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, well almost. The final screw that holds the trigger/switch mechanism in place is deep inside the handle, with a very narrow gap to access it. My new torx screwdriver is too wide and I couldn't find a work-around. I can press two parts of the trigger and they move independently of each other, which they should not. So the trigger is broken. I phoned the owner and she agreed to by a new trigger and a long torx screwdriver to reach the final screw. I ordered both from the same supplier.</p>
        <p>While I was playing with the Dyson, Angela cut the grass and later made 'chewy bar' and biscuits.</p>
