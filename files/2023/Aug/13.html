        <h1>Sunday 13th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I rubbed down the small patch of new paint on the Panda (taking it too far down to the primer) and applied a second coat. Then I unpacked my tools from yesterday's Repair Cafe and brought the portable radio inside to look at. It seemed to work, but there was a lot of crackle when adjusting the volume. It took a little effort to get inside and and I was able to remove the volume wheel and expose the carbon variable resistor. Cleaning it with a cotton bud and some nail polish remover (acetone) cleaned out a lot of muck and it then seemed to work well. I can return it to the owner at tomorrow's lunch club, since she is one of the helpers.</p>
        <p>After lunch I made some bread rolls. I think I made the dough too wet, since it was a bit sticky and the rolls are flat. Whilst the dough was rising I went for a walk across to the park and behind Lanes Road, only for about half an hour.</p>
        <p>Paul et al had visitors, so we spoke to the while we were having dinner.</p>
        <p>During the evening we watched another BBC Prom, part of which was Mozart's fourth horn concerto, where the soloist was born with no arms and so uses one foot to press the keys on the horn.</p>
