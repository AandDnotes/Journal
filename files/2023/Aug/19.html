        <h1>Saturday 18th August</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday morning, we started with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also wanted some potatoes, since those bought from Tesco were all bad in the middle! On the way back we went up Newham Lane to see if the vegetable grower had put out any runner beans. He hadn't. So we just picked a few blackberries, which Angela put with some apples in a crumble. The day started overcast with occasional drizzle, but brighten as the day went on.</p>
        <p>Then, again as usual, I did the weekly accounts and also set the maturity options for three ISAs (two of mine and one of Angela's). I just reinvested the whole amount for one year with the existing banks.</p>
        <p>Angela wasn't able to get the main filter out of the vacuum cleaner, but when I did it looked as though it had never been cleaned. I spent a long time brushing it in the garden and then we washed it and the other filters. When we put it back together it will probably lift the carpets!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the new washers for the TC's carburettors did not arrive. I wanted to fit the before taking the car for its MoT on Tuesday. So I just checked the tyre pressures on both cars and then brushed away some weeds on the drive.</p>
