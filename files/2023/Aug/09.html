        <h1>Wednesday 9th August</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was more or less right. No rain! And quite a lot of sunshine. Angela went off walking (to Henfield) and a little later I took the TC off to collect Martin and then off to the Red Lion at Ashington to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee and brownies we followed a round about route to the White Horse at Maplehurst for a barbecue lunch (including pudding). It was very good.</p>
        <p>When we got back to Steyning I had tea in Sarah's (Martin's wife) garden. I finally got home at about 4:30 after doing 44 miles, to find Angela working in the garden. She had cut all the grass.</p>
