        <h1>Saturday 12th August</h1>
        <p>A difficult day to predict, weather-wise. It started sunny, clouded over, rained and then oscillated between sunny and cloudy. We started with the usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper (and some yoghurt). Then I did the weekly accounts, including a reconciliation against a bank statement.</p>
        <p>After that, I went into the garage to rub down the primer that I'd put on the Panda and then to apply one coat of white paint.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went off to the Repair Cafe in Beeding. It was busy and there were only three of us on the electro-mechanical bench. I have brought home a small radio and a Dyson vacuum cleaner to try to fix.</p>
