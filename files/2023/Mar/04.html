        <h1>Saturday 4th March</h1>
        <p>We walked to the High Street, to the market and to buy a paper. I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly and monthly accounts. We then spent two and a half hours talking with (listening to) Victoria. There is a (remote) possibility that Brandon will try for a job with his previous boss in Arkansas!</p>
        <p>Afterwards we showered changed and went to the Toll Gate for the MG club annual dinner. Angela wore her new dress and I wore my dinner jacket. It took me a while to tie my bow tie, but it was a good evening.</p>
