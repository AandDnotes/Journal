        <h1>Thursday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>Unexpectedly we had blue sky from dawn to dusk. We started by going into Worthing, parking in Waitrose and walking to Millets, where I bought some walking boots. We then went back to Waitrose for coffee and to do the grocery shopping. We got home just before midday.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of time pouring over her WI accounts in preparation for the AGM. I received a Coventry Building Society form to fill in, which I did. Also an email from Santander informed me that they had closed Dad's account and moved the money. When I checked, there was also a deposit from Shawbrook Bank.</p>
        <p>I continued working on my python project. I managed to get a cropped view from the camera displayed in a cell in my grid.</p>
