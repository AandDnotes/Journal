        <h1>Monday 20th March</h1>
        <p>The spring equinox, so the what some define as the start of Spring. It rained for most of the day! Angela went to her exercise group in the morning and to her WI AGM in the afternoon. They have decided to close, but need to follow a procedure. It will take a while to be completely free from it. I sent some email and transferred another Â£50,000 to Alan.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a phone call from Sue McNaughton to tell me that Hamish had passed away just after midnight this morning. He had been asleep for 36 hours and passed peacefully. She was very complementary about the hospice staff and will let me know the funeral details. I then emailed the Eurotherm group, the IET group and George.</p>
        <p>I phoned the pharmacy, as instructed, and my 120mg verapamil tablets had arrived. So I braved the rain, which had eased quite a bit, and collected them, along with some laxative. The latter says to take 1-3 sachets per day for two weeks, so I took one sachet before dinner to see how it goes.</p>
        <p>I managed to spend some time looking at my python project. I managed to get my example image to the same form as the validation images (a one-dimensional column array), but that gave an error when trying to do a dot product calculation. One step forward always seems to be accompanied by one step back!</p>
