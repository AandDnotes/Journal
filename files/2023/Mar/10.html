        <h1>Friday 10th March</h1>
        <p>The day started damp, but warmer than previous days. However, although it stayed mainly dry, the temperature fell as the day wore on. Angela went to the High Street to buy a few things and I spent a lot of the morning collecting together tools and materials to take along to the Repair Cafe tomorrow. I also started preparing an Adestra email for remind people about the next talk, adding a note about the talk after that. Later in the day I finished it and submitted it for approval.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I went into the garage, cleaned the TC's plugs and started it, running the engine for a while. I also checked the lights, horn and windscreen wipers. Wednesday's Wanderers run will be the first major run of the year.</p>
