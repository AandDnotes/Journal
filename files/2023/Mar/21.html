        <h1>Tuesday 21st March</h1>
        <p>I walked down to the High Street with Angela. She went on to the Steyning Centre and I went to the stationers to buy some white card for printing speaker certificates. So I spent most of the morning dealing with email or generating things for this evening's talk. I also had a request from Steve West to introduce the 'routes to registration' workshop tomorrow evening, since he would not be back from visiting a client in time.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunchtime due to the evening's IET talk. Afterwards I did some more work on my project; a little further understanding, rather than progress.</p>
        <p>Then it was off to Falmer for a very interesting talk from Phil Birch.</p>
