        <h1>Thursday 16th March</h1>
        <p>Another day moping about. In fact, I went back to bed after breakfast while Angela went off to do the weekly grocery shop.</p>
        <p>Until later in the day it was sunny and quite warm, then there was a little rain. Angela worked in the garden, but my only excursion outside was to put the cover on the MG. Otherwise, I did a lot of sitting around and did a little more investigation into the image format needed by my python project. It looks as though I had previously got it completely wrong.</p>
        <p>After dinner I chaired the PEI group meeting. Tiring.</p>
