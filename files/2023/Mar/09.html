        <h1>Thursday 9th March</h1>
        <p>After the snow we had rain for most of the day. We set off early to Holmebush to do the weekly groceries shop in M&S, since Angela had a Â£5 off voucher. We stopped for coffee and were still home early enough to do some work before I had to go to the dentist. Our new dentist stuck my front crown back in place. However, I had to wait an hour before I could eat, so I had a late lunch.</p>
        <p>I started uploading the recording of Tuesday's talk to YouTube before I went to the dentist and later I added the link to the IET Sussex events programme page. I also had some time to work on my python project. I managed to 'freeze' the image from the camera by pressing a button, but my attempt to add more buttons is not working.</p>
