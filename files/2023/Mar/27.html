        <h1>Monday 27th March</h1>
        <p>We woke to bright sunshine and it stayed bright until sunset. We were not up particularly early, but we had breakfast with Chris, Alan and Chris before setting off for home.</p>
        <p>Luckily the M1 and the M25 were clear and we arrived home just before one. During the afternoon we cut the grass (since today looks like the only dry day of the week) and spoke with Paul</p>
        <p>During the evening I played further with my python project and managed to convert the image from the MacBook's camera such that the neural network identified (at least two) hand-written numbers. However, I need to update the result on the screen.</p>
