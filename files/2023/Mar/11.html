        <h1>Saturday 11th March</h1>
        <p>Our Saturday morning started, as usual, with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper, although we also got some cash. Then I did the weekly accounts, followed by my Dutch lessons, since, after an early lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. I had a heavy tool box, so I took the Panda and dropped Angela of near Maudlin Lane so that she could deliver a birthday card to Mel.</p>
        <p>So I spent my first time at the Repair Cafe. I helped a man re-assemble a 40-year-old toy, failed to get into a coffee maker, opened the draw of an old DVD play with a DVD stuck inside, made suggestions to someone about their (cheap) water jet teeth cleaner and started dismantling a convector heater. Then we ran out of time, so I bout the heater bits home in the hope of finding out why it doesn't work. The time went very quickly, but was quite tiring. At the end I met Phil Birch there. He is part of a team who give advice on saving energy and now lives in Hills Road.</p>
        <p>I made further progress on my python project. I 'finished' the GUI and converted the image, ready to put into the neural network.</p>
