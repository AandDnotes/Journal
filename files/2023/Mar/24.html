        <h1>Friday 24th March</h1>
        <p>A frustrating day, for both of us. While Angela caught the bus to Storrington to close one of the WI's bank accounts, I prepared an Adestra email advertising the the next talks. That was successful, but Angela, in spite of doing what she had been told to do, couldn't close the account. I also check over the Panda, prior to our journey tomorrow.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to have her hair cut. I continued worked on my python project. I discovered how to convert my image data, but, although two mnist data images gave the correct result, images from my program all give the same (incorrect) result!</p>
