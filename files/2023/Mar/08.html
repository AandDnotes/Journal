        <h1>Wednesday 8th March</h1>
        <p>It may be meteorological spring, but we woke to a thin covering of snow this morning. That soon turned to rain and it drizzled on and off for the rest of the day, not getting very warm.</p>
        <p>I spent the morning and part of the afternoon dealing with IET-related things. I edited the recording of last evening's talk, exported it and then compressed it so that it is ready to upload to YouTube. I also thanked the speaker and created an Adestra email about the 'routes to registration' online workshop later this month. In the process I noticed that Steve had not produced a newsletter since November, so we are missing one of our advertising opportunities.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and I finished some other IET-related things and went into the garage to start collecting together tools and materials for Saturdays 'Repair Cafe'. I couldn't find my soldering iron or any multi-ended DC power adaptors. They may be in the bottom draw of my cupboard, which I can't currently open. Later I 'played' with my python project, making further slight gains.</p>
