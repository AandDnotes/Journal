        <h1>Monday 13th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went off to buy a few things in the High Street and then to the lunch club, I finished reassembling the Repair Cafe convector heater. I had to file flats on the washer that was used to cover the broken hole in one of the feet. I then ran it for a few minutes on full power.</p>
        <p>Then it was off to the lunch club. Phylis asked me to 'assist' Gordon to walk round, although he didn't need any help. A lot of people were ill and so there were only about 20 people there, so there was plenty of food. As usual, I cleared away the chairs and tables afterwards.</p>
        <p>Later I started trying to integrate the neural network with my GUI, but seem to have a mismatch between the image format and what the network code expects. After a light tea I went off to the MG club meeting at Washington. I paid David F-B for the Drive It Day entrance to Parham and towards the end I met a newish member who owns a TC!</p>
