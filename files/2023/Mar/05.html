        <h1>Sunday 5th March</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day. I spent a lot of time trying to get my Scratch 'Control' program set up on the MacBook. But without success. It was written for Scratch 2, which was written in an Adobe 'language'. That is now not owned by Adobe, although it is still available. However it won't work on an M1 processor. I tried various things, but to no avail.</p>
        <p>As usual, we spoke with Paul during the afternoon.</p>
