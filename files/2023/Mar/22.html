        <h1>Wednesday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>Quite a blustery and mainly wet day. Later in the morning Angela went to the High Street and then after lunch to her table tennis meeting. I sorted things from yesterday's talk, arranged for Chistine to be sent a theatre ticket gift card and worked on my python project. Again, progress, but only in terms of knowledge.</p>
        <p>In the middle of dinner (I had the starter early) I joined the 'routes to registration' workshop, where I introduced the speaker and thanked him at the end. WE had 28 attendees.</p>
