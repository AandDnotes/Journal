        <h1>Sunday 19th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I worked out how much we had spent on Dad's affairs and so how much we had to split with Alan. I then transferred Â£50K to Alan's account. I also emailed Derek Woodley about giving his 'a day in the life of a Concord pilot' talk to the RCEA.</p>
        <p>Then spent quite some time working on my python project. I still can't work out how to get the image into a form that the neural network will accept.</p>
        <p>As usual, we spoke with Paul and very briefly with Rowan.</p>
