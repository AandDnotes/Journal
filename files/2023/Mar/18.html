        <h1>Saturday 18th March</h1>
        <p>Another day that started wet, but brightened up at lunchtime. So in the afternoon it was quite sunny and warm. Angela walked down to the High Street (in the rain) to buy a newspaper and some rolls and after lunch I walked to the pharmacy (in the sunshine) to see if my prescription was ready. It was not, so I need to phone on Monday afternoon to see if my verapamil tablets have arrived. They tried to give me the last in the batch of bisoprolol, which should have been cancelled two months ago.</p>
        <p>During the raining morning I did the weekly accounts, reconciling them against the bank statement. I also checked the expenditure associated with Dad's funeral and probate, etc. Before my walk after lunch we checked to see if Victoria wanted to talk. She asked that we wait ten minutes. I arrived home 45 minutes later and she called as I was taking my coat off.</p>
        <p>After Austin's biopsy, it seems that he does have celiac disease and so they need to cut gluten from his diet, which is going to take a while to achieve. She was on FaceTime for nearly two hours.</p>
