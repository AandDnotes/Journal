        <h1>Wednesday 1st March</h1>
        <p>Angela woke this morning with a bloodshot eye, around the lower lid. So she went to the pharmacist to get advice and also went to the Post Office. I worked on my python project. Although I couldn't work out how to get my 'image in grid' code to work with classes, I did get a class version to work that displays a stream from the camera. But I failed to resize the frame, so it might be better to crop it to a small square central area.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to see a film; the sequel to Fishermans Friends. We took Gill and the film was good. We took the car since it was cold and got home just before ten.</p>
