        <h1>Friday 17th March</h1>
        <p>Another day disrupted by my cold. Angela braved the wet weather this morning and went to the butchers. I dealt with a number of things such as getting an Adestra email issued. I also received notification from the Coventry Building Society that they had closed Dad's account and moved the money to his old Barclays account. So I checked the account and all is now there. I phoned Alan later to ask him for their account details so that I can transfer half to him.</p>
        <p>Mainly during the afternoon I put together most of the email recording yesterday evening's PEI group meeting. Since it had turned sunny after lunch I went for a 15-minute walk around the block, just so as to get some fresh air.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela went to the quiz night and I cooked my own dinner.</p>
