        <h1>Thursday 30th March</h1>
        <p>Quite often on a Thursday we spend all morning shopping. So it was this morning. Although I did order two HDMI connectors, initiated a transfer to Victoria's account and gave Paul a birthday present, before we went out. We started by going to the Mayberry garden centre to get some vegetable seeds and some compost. Then it was coffee in M&amp;S, followed by mainly vegetable shopping there and a few other things in Tesco. So were home in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>While we were on our way between M&amp;S and Tesco I got a call from the bank. When I did the online transfer, the bank's website said that a review would need to be carried out before the transfer was carried out. Phone reception was poor, but eventually the <s>idiot</s> fellow from the bank said he would approve the transfer. Later I emailed Victoria and she confirmed that the money had arrived in her account.</p>
        <p>I spent a little time examining a number image from the mnist data and from my program. The mnist '8' looked less like an 8 than my image looked like a 9.</p>
