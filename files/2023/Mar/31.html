        <h1>Friday 31st March</h1>
        <p>Another mainly rainy day. Angela went to the High Street and managed to miss the rain. I went to the Post Office to pick up my Amazon package, just encountering a little drizzle.</p>
        <p>I had intended doing the preparation for Tuesday's talk, but spent a lot of the morning exploring the possibility of going to Boston for a few days on our way to Victoria's. Later in the afternoon I spoke to Sue McNaughton and then emailed the Eurotherm and IET groups with some details.</p>
        <p>More time was spent 'playing' with my python project. I reduced the size of the image so that a smaller digit could be used. However, the neural network still got some images wrong. I added a 'Reset' button to make it easier to test.</p>
        <p>I also transferred Â£50K from Dad's account to Paul. I had no trouble this time and Paul confirmed that it had arrived.</p>
