        <h1>Saturday 25th March</h1>
        <p>The main objective for today was to drive up to Alan and Christine's in Tilsworth so as to arrive between 6:00 and 6:30. So we spent the morning doing our usual Saturday jobs, before getting ourselves ready. I walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper while Angela showered and then I did the same. I also did the weekly accounts and filed away some share and accounts documents.</p>
        <p>We set off at 3:30, stopped for a cup of tea at Cobham services and arrived outside Yellow farm at a few minutes past six. Luckily, Michele's parents were just negotiating the gate (electric, with a code to open it), so we were able to drive in. There was a huddle of people outside the front door, who had been let in by the time we got there. Christine was still in shock, since it had all been arranged without her knowledge. It was the usual collection of family and friends, plus some of their friends who we had not met before. About 30 people in all.</p>
        <p>They (Alan, Laura and Richard) had arranged food from a caterer and so, after eating and much chatter, we finally got to bed at about 3:30am. Christine's sister-in-law, Chris and a friend from Yorkshire also stayed.</p>
