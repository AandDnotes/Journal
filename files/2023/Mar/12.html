        <h1>Sunday 12th March</h1>
        <p>It was noticeably warmer this morning and started out sunny. It rained later.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I unpacked my toolbox from yesterday, tightened bolts on the TC's carburettors and investigated the convector heater that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. I couldn't find continuity through the thermostat, so I cleaned the points with emery paper. That seemed to fix it. When I turned it on it worked for a while, but I had forgotten that the plug had only a 3 amp fuse, which had blown. So I put a 13 amp fuse in it and started reassembling the case.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke firstly with Victoria and then with Paul. Then we ate early(ish) so that we could watch the first episode of David Attenborough's 'Wild Isles' programme. It was interesting, but I think I went to sleep in it.</p>
