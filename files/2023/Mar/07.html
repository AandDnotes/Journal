        <h1>Tuesday 7th March</h1>
        <p>The morning was spent mainly preparing for the evening's talk, while Angela went to the High Street and library. After lunch (dinner) I read (the latest edition of Flypaper) and did a little more investigation on tkinter grids.</p>
        <p>Later I went to Crawley for the IET Sussex talk. We only had 20 people in the audience, but it was an interesting talk. The speaker had come down from Reading.</p>
