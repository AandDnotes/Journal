        <h1>Wednesday 29th March</h1>
        <p>A grey day, with some drizzle in the morning and rain in the evening. Angela spent a lot of the day out of the house. She helped clear out the WI cupboard at the Steyning Centre before lunch and then went to table tennis in the afternoon. I spent a lot of the morning sending emails on various topics and also vacuumed the seats of the Panda, having 'washed' the driver's seat yesterday.</p>
        <p>Just before two o'clock the car window repairer arrived to replace the Panda's windscreen. I had tried to repair the star crack, but the old resin I used would not go into the crack. That meant that the windscreen had to be replaced. I reversed the Panda out on to the drive next to his van and he had replaced the windscreen by 2:30.</p>
        <p>I spent the remainder of the day trying various things to improve the performance of my hand-written number identifier; with little success. However, I did manage to get better contrast adjustment and filtering of the image. Although the content of the array looks clear, the neural network still gets some wrong.</p>
