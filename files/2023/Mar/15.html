        <h1>Wednesday 15th March</h1>
        <p>It was a quiet day, having decided not to take the TC on the Wanderers run. My sore throat had turned into a head cold. So I did a lot of sitting around. The day started sunny and it was not until late in the afternoon that we had any rain. So it would have been a good day for a run in the TC.</p>
        <p>I emailed Gavin, Laura, Mike, Penny and Joanne.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went to table tennis after lunch. I managed to do a little work on my python project, but didn't really make any progress.</p>
