        <h1>Tuesday 14th March</h1>
        <p>I had a bad night. I had a slight sore throat and I couldn't sleep. It was about 4:30 before I fell asleep and had been needing to empty my bladdder avery half hour. I still had a mild sore throat when I got up.</p>
        <p>I phoned Sue McNaughton. The news on Hamish was not good, so I sent a summary to the Eurotherm and IET groups.</p>
