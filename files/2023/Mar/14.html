        <h1>Tuesday 14th March</h1>
        <p>I had a bad night. I had a slight sore throat and I couldn't sleep. It was about 4:30 before I fell asleep and had been needing to empty my bladder every half hour. I still had a mild sore throat when I got up.</p>
        <p>I phoned Sue McNaughton. The news on Hamish was not good, so I sent a summary to the Eurotherm and IET groups.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon I had intended going to an RCEA talk in Worthing, but decided not to go. I took a Covid test (which was negative) and then emailed Ursula so say that I (and Martin) would not be going on the Wanderers run tomorrow. The first test kit that I tried didn't seem to have enough fluid, so I had to use another one.</p>
