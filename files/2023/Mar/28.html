        <h1>Tuesday 28th March</h1>
        <p>Quite a different day to yesterday. I was overcast all day and rained quite a bit.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street (and got wet) and I emailed Daniel Eastwood about a joint event. I also emailed Victoria and Paul about their money from Dad. Then I had a call from HSL about paying the balance for the chairs, but put them off until tomorrow since there is not enough money in our current account. So I transferred £21K from Angela's Virgin account. £20K was for a an ISA, so I opened a Shawbrook ISA for Angela and, later, moved £20K into it.</p>
        <p>I got my python code working, but the neural network ot most of the numbers wrong!</p>
        <p>After dinner I tried to join the IET Sussex events meeting. Tried, because I was updating the iMac and used the MacBook. It said that Teams was an old version, but updating it seemed to lose my login. It took me 40 minutes to join the meeting, after changing the password. There is the problem that I have several Teams accounts, one that is called 'IET Sussex' which I created as a test before Teams was available via Office 365.</p>
