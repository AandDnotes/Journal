        <h1>Friday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>A busy and quite productive day. And another calm, bright (if not particularly sunny) and mild day. I started by starting the TC and taking it on my figure of eight test run. It took a lot of cranking to start, but got there eventually. I guess that the plugs were damp. The car ran well, but there seems to be a slight fuel leak from the pump inlet and the banjo on the front carburettor.</p>
        <p>Then I started building the bin store. I did some in the morning and some later in the afternoon. I used twelve brackets to fix together the sides, back panels and the internal structures.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I went to the SRFC meeting. Other members had brought along the models or part models that they have been working on over winter. I left fairly early, since I had looked at their models and talk to people about them. So I was home by a quarter to nine.</p>
