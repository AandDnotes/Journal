        <h1>Thursday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>We made a relatively early trip to Lyons Farm this morning and were back in time for a slightly late coffee. Then I updated the IET Sussex programme web page.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I refitted the fuel pump after tightening the screws. It worked well, without leaks, but there was a big leak from the banjo end of the new pipe between the carburettors. I discovered that the banjo has different sides, so I turned it round. It seemed to work, but I may need to use thread lock.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined a webinar on the Rolls Royce SMR. Little was said about the reactor design, but the description about the modularisation and construction was interesting.</p>
