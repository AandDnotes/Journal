        <h1>Friday 10th February</h1>
        <p>I think of Friday as the one day of the week when we have nothing organised, and so a day to do things we want to do rather than need to do. In fact, my only intent was to try to fix the fuel leaks on the TC. However, today was different. Angela went off early(ish) to meet her WI auditor at the Old Barn nursery and I dealt with email and started editing the video that I'd taken at the last IET talk. Angela was home by eleven and so, since I'd been out in the Panda yesterday we had to do the weekly shop. So we went to Lyons Farm, including a visit to B&amp;Q to buy some polyanthus.</p>
        <p>We were home just after one and so it was later in the day before we got outside. It was still quite chilly, with little sun, but Angela tidied parts of the garden and I modified the top of the garden bin so that the chain would not slip off and then moved the hanging basket from above the bin store to a piece of garage wall next to the gate. By this time it was getting chilly. So no work on the TC.</p>
        <p>I finished editing the video clips, although I still need to add a title and export it. Then we had an early dinner and went to the Methodist church for an evening of shuffleboard. Our team of three did not do very well.</p>
