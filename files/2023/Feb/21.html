        <h1>Tuesday 21st February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash. I prepared things for the evening's talk and tackled more on closing Dad's savings account. That did require half an hour on hold on the phone, but I did post documents to two banks.</p>
        <p>Being Shrove Tuesday we had pancakes. Since I was going out to an IET talk in the evening we had our main meal at lunchtime. We kept the pancakes in the warming drawer and then sat down at the dining table to eat them. So they were not as hot as they could have been.</p>
        <p>The talk at Falmer was interesting, but the speaker tried to impart too much in the time available.</p>
