        <h1>Tuesday 14th February</h1>
        <p>I started by sorting out a problem on the iMac. It wouldn't switch users and then I turned off bluetooth without thinking. Of course, the mouse and keyboard would then not work. I plugged in the keyboard, which then worked, but didn't think about plugging in a USB mouse until after I had forced the iMac to restart. Then I called the prescription team at the surgery to find out how I can get my next supply of verapamil. I should be able to pick up a new pack tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I sent Dave P details of the talk that I arranged and spent some time uploading the video to YouTube. Otherwise it was reading the paper. Then after lunch I went to the RCEA talk on artillery targeting. It was very slow. I got home just before five.</p>
