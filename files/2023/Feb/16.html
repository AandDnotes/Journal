        <h1>Thursday 16th February</h1>
        <p>If success is measured in terms of the amount you spend, then today was quite successful. I started by filling the Panda with fuel at Tesco while Angela looked at dresses in Next. We then went to Lidl to do our weekly shop, followed by a trip to Dunelm to by new pillows and hand towels. We also bought two plastic baskets to 'contain' items on the shelf in the coat cupboard.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spent even more. Actually we donated rather than spent, firstly to the DEC Turkey/Syria appeal, then to Turning Tides and raffle tickets from St Barnabas.</p>
        <p>Later I researched outside lights and started developing a web site about the TC's fuel pump.</p>
