        <h1>Tuesday 7th February</h1>
        <p>Mainly successes today. It was foggy this morning and cold, so while Angela went to her exercise group I downloaded the attendance list for this evening's talk (although Shanir had also done that).</p>
        <p>After lunch I removed the the doors from the bin store and re-fitted them, hinged on the left. I also fitted bolts to two doors, needing to move the two that I had already fitted. Then I started re-reading the information for Thursday's FIRST Lego League event.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove to Crawley to help set up for the IET talk. Ramon did not arrive, so I tried to record it on my phone. I will look at it tomorrow, but I was surprised that it only used about 30% of the power. It was a well presented talk, but not that interesting. There were probably more people from Elekta (for whom the speaker works) than others. I got home at about 9:45.</p>
