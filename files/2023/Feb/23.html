        <h1>Thursday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>Like most weeks, Thursday is shopping day. Angela had a voucher for M&amp;S and wanted to look for a dress, so we decided to go to Holmebush. We started in the clothes department. Angela found a dress that she liked and I found some cord trousers that seemed to fit well. We then had coffee and did the grocery shopping. We were home just in time to prepare some lunch.</p>
        <p>A grey day became brighter, even sunny, so Angela went into the garden and I dealt with some email. I confirmed my attendance at next month's Sussex Wanderers run (along with Martin G) and mailed the speaker for the next talk at the Hawth. Then I did a little more research into image processing in Python, discovering yet another image processing library (skimage) and, perhaps, a way to  find the angle of a reference line in an image. However, it is a big 'perhaps'.</p>
