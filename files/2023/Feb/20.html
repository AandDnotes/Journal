        <h1>Monday 20th February</h1>
        <p>'London walk' day. I was 20 minutes early for the 9:43 train from Shoreham to Victoria. Martin got on at Burgess Hill, we moved carriages to join three of the others and met the other two as we got off the train. Then we met John at the Shakespeare pub. After coffee (without milk) we set off, stopping for a drink shortly after, then lunch in Leadenhall Market, a renovated covered market, and finally dinner at a pub not far from Victoria station. We used the underground to get to Tower Hill and back and cent in to a couple of churches including St Mary-le-Bow and an art gallery near the Guildhall. Some went up the Monument, while Martin and I had coffee and others sat outside.</p>
        <p>The pub we went to for dinner (supposidly serving excellent pies) was a disaster. They had little left on their menu, certainly no pies, so most of us settled for fish and chips until they ran out of that too!</p>
        <p>We caught the 7:16 train home, which was lucky since the later trains were cancelled! I was home just after 8:30.</p>
