        <h1>Wednesday 8th February</h1>
        <p>Another cold and misty morning. So I worked inside until after lunch. I uploaded the video of Tuesday's talk to the iMac. It is surprisingly good.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to table tennis I finished the bin store. I had to cut 'hooks' in the lid of the recycling bin to catch the chain from the lid. Even though it was the afternoon it was still pretty cold. I then watched the FLL video again.</p>
