        <h1>Saturday 4th February</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day in more sense of the word than one. I'd had difficulty going to the toilet for quite a few days and this morning I couldn't open my bowels at all. It was probably a side effect of the verapavil medication. So while Angela went to buy a newspaper and some rolls, I went see the pharmacist. She suggested a laxative, but is cautious about me being dependent on it. It hasn't worked yet!</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent doing the the weekly and monthly accounts and reading the newspaper.</p>
