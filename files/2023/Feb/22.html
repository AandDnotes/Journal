        <h1>Wednesday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>We received our new general waste bin this morning. Luckily I put the old one out after breakfast (in my dressing gown), since they came before I was out of the shower. Later I fitted a hook on the lid for the chain to attach. I need to paint a number on the bin (as well as fix the lid on the garden waste bin).</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I spent time preparing and sending forms to Dad's RCI and Santander building societies. I've now done all I can until I get replies from them. Angela went to table tennis in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>After a hurried dinner I joined the IET Sussex events meeting. I think I only have a couple of actions!</p>
