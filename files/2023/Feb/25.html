        <h1>Saturday 25th February</h1>
        <p>Today didn't turn out quite as expected. Yes, I walked to the High Street to buy a paper while Angela hung out the washing. Yes, we went off to look at more armchairs for a replacement for mine. We started (and finished) by going to HSL in Hove. The assistant took us on a tour of the shop, trying each model. They were all pretty conventional fireside type chairs, but none had much in the way of lumber support, at least that supported my back. She had walked past the separate 'room' that had the 'Stressless' collection, so I asked about them. We had picked up a brochure yesterday, so we knew they were expensive. However, what we didn't know was that HSL have their own, cheaper version. It was very comfortable. The assistant left us sat looking at fabrics and drinking coffee, with Angela sat in the standard version (slightly smaller than the one I was sitting in). She commented how nice and comfortable it was. So we decided to replace my chair and one of the sofas with two new chairs. Although the standard version in a particular fabric was at a sale price, we decided to go for two identical (apart from size) chairs in a cream leather. We paid a deposit, with the balance due in four to six weeks and delivery in 10-12 weeks.</p>
        <p>On the way home we stopped at Maybury garden centre to buy some seeds. Angela also bought a couple of plug plants and I bought some stick-on numbers for the new bin. We were home for lunch.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was spent catching up on weekly accounts and doing more research on image processing for me and tidying in the garden for Angela.</p>
