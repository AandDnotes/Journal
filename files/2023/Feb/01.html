        <h1>Wednesday 1st February</h1>
        <p>The new month started dry and bright and not quite so cold. Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to get her WI end of year bank statement. Most of the country, well, at least the train drivers and teachers, were on strike today, but luckily the busses were still running.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I spent some time drawing a 'tulip diagram' for my route to Aldwick (Bognor) in the afternoon. As it happened, Google Maps on my phone worked well as a satnav and only used 0.1 GB of my data allowance for the return journey. Otherwise, I emailed Hereesh at the UoS about finding a speaker.</p>
        <p>At one o'clock I set off for Bognor (listening to the Google Map's lady), arriving at Peter Cole's house at ten to two. He tested my fuel pump on his rig and it didn't work, so he stripped it down. He replaced the diaphragm, the point, one of the valve discs and all the gaskets. He also changed the output 'L' connector. He tested it on his rig and the flow rate was fine. We assume that the diaphragm had become too stiff. I left at three o' clock and was home by four.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela had been to table tennis.</p>
