        <h1>Saturday 11th February</h1>
        <p>Today was overcast, calm and a little warmer than of recent. We took our usual stroll to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then I did the weekly accounts. This included reconciliation against the bank statement and so took the rest of the morning.</p>
        <p>Victoria et al were going to the Cub Scouts pinewood Derby today, so we postponed our chat util tomorrow. So we took another stroll, this time to the Beeding parish hall, where a Repair Cafe was taking place. It was very busy, with a lot of people just having tea/coffee and cake. I spoke to the organiser, who will contact me about helping. We met Felicity and John there. They had taken something to be repaired. On the way out I met Richard xxx, who lives in Hills Road and still works at Eurotherm. He also helps at a code club every fortnight.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I did a little research into getting Python code to use the MacBook's camera.</p>
