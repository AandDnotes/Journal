        <h1>Friday 17th February</h1>
        <p>It was a grey day and, although Angela went out to a meeting after lunch, I didn't go outside at all. However, I did have some success. This morning I found a report that OpenCV does not work in Python IDLE, but does work if a script is run from Terminal. So I managed to use a small program to view input from the MacBook camera and take snap of it. Later I started investigating shape detection.</p>
        <p>My other activity was to complete a web page on the work done on the TC's fuel pump and integrate it into my TC set of pages.</p>
