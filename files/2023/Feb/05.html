        <h1>Sunday 5th February</h1>
        <p>Today was bright, but colder. Nevertheless I went out early (well, 9:30) and fitted the lids. I had done that by lunchtime, just before Angela got back fro church. However, I discovered that the doors would not fit! the gap at the bottom was too narrow.</p>
        <p>So after lunch I modified the floor bars. They were not long enough to allow the doors to fit. So I moved the bracket at one end. Meanwhile, Angela worked in the garden. I also looked at how the door brackets would fit. Luckily the 'kit' included extra short screws. Then it was time to talk with Paul.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed a new speaker from the University of Sussex.</p>
