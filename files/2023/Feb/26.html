        <h1>Sunday 26th February</h1>
        <p>I started by sending the image for the next talk to Mark C while Angela went to church. I then put the numbers on the new wheely-bin and finally shaped some pieces of old broom handle to attach the lid to the garden waste bin. It was a bright, but cold day, so when I came inside just before midday, I was quite cold.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did some more research in connection with my AI project. Then we spoke with Paul et al. Later Victoria called. They had arrived home after their 'camping' weekend.</p>
