        <h1>Sunday 19th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church, but stayed for lunch and then an annual meeting. She got home just before four. That meant I had to cook my own lunch, which was pretty much a disaster. I over-cooked a salmon fillet in the microwave. It really only needed half the time, if that. I also cooked a lemon-drizzle 'mug' sponge. It had a texture that was more like a plastic sponge!</p>
        <p>Before lunch and also later in the afternoon I started the process of closing Dad's savings accounts. I checked what was in each account by logging in to each. The process for each of the five accounts is different. I emailed one, only to get a reply later that simply pointed me back the page I had started following. Then I completed an online form for another account and downloaded a 'close account' form from another.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul (and very briefly with Rowan).</p>
