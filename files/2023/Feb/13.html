        <h1>Tuesday 13th February</h1>
        <p>A day with a number of events and lots of sunshine. Angela went off this morning to help at the lunch club. She was booking people in today and then helped wash up and clear away. I dealt with some email and prepared the video of the last IET talk for upload to YouTube. Then I went for lunch.</p>
        <p>I spoke briefly with Sue McNaughton about Hamish and then later joined the Eurotherm Group Zoom meeting. After a light tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington.</p>
