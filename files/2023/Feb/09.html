        <h1>Thursday 9th February</h1>
        <p>It was an early start. I was up (at 6:20) before the alarm went off. I then left at 7:40 and arrived at Hayward Heath College at 8:15. The rest of the day, at least until 3pm, was the FIRST Lego League heat. There were 12 teams, I think from ten schools. It was well run and, with about a dozen Ambassadors, was fairly relaxed.</p>
