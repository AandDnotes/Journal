        <h1>Wednesday 15th February</h1>
        <p>After emailing Ramon about the video of the last talk and while Angela walked to the High Street and back, I took the TC for a run. The red petrol light was on, so I started by going to the petrol station in Beeding and then went up through Henfield to Partridge Green and back via Ashurst. The car ran well after taking a lot of turning to start in the first place. Also, on my return, there didn't seem to be any fuel leaks.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I walked down to Steyning to have my hair cut and then to the pharmacy to collect a second month's work of Verapamil tablets. I then spent quite a lot of time installing operating system updates on the MacBook and iMac. The latter keeps refusing to switch users!</p>
