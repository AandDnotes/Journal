        <h1>Friday 24th February</h1>
        <p>The day was dictated by the fact that Angela had to collect her WI accounts books from the auditor in Angmering. So I dropped her at the house and went to what we think of as 'Roundstone garden centre', even though it is now called Haskins. I wandered around, had some coffee and an hour and a half after I had left her, Angela phoned to say that she was lost! She arrive 15 minutes later and then had coffee.</p>
        <p>We decided to go into Worthing to look at chairs. We started with lunch in Waitrose and then went to Schadgels and Polands. We were home before three. Then it was a case of catching up with events.</p>
