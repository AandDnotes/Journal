        <h1>Monday 27th February</h1>
        <p>In spite of what the forecast said, it was sunny for most of the day, but in the evening I couldn't see any sight of the Northern Lights (which have been visible all over the UK due to higher than usual emissions from the sun). Although I could see the moon and a couple of stars, I think there was cloud to the North.</p>
        <p>I helped Angela set up a spreadsheet for her Lunch Club accounts. It may need modifying, but the basics are there. This took a good part of the afternoon. Otherwise I researched and experimented with the display part of my AI demo app. I managed to get a three-column by one-row grid and display an image in it. I now need to display the video from the camera.</p>
        <p>After dinner I walked down to the Chequers Inn to meet the other electrical/electronic repairers for the Repair Cafe. Three of us were new, with the other six being long-time volunteers. It seems that I need to set up a WhatsApp account!</p>
