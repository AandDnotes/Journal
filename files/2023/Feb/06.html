        <h1>Monday 6th February</h1>
        <p>A day of successes and failures. I prepared the start slide and speaker certificate for tomorrow's IET talk while the outside temperature was still around four degrees. I added a slide advertising membership of the IET. Angela went to her exercise group.</p>
        <p>Then, before lunch, I fitted the first door on the bin store. After lunch, while it was still sunny, I fitted the other two doors and started fitting the bolts. Then I discovered that the middle door had dropped. Actually it was the frame that had moved, possibly because I hung the heavy doors with their hinges on the right. So the weight of the doors may be stressing the frame. And that is also down the slight slope. So I will try to rehang them on the left. When fitting the hinges I did not allow for the width of the bolt hasp on the upright.</p>
        <p>Later I managed to convert a jpeg image to greyscale bitmap, then to a numpy array and then to Python list of lists, which is the form of the neural network input. I now need to convert the 0-255 range of each value to 0.0-1.0.</p>
