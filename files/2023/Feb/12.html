        <h1>Sunday 12th February</h1>
        <p>Quite a productive morning. While Angela was at church I produced an Adestra email advertising the next IET talk. Then I put some bread on to cook, emailed Mark with the image for posting on Twitter and linkedIn and then added a title and end shot to my recording of the last IET talk. Finally, I attempted to fix the fuel leaks on the TC.</p>
        <p>After lunch I exported the video and ran it through Handbrake, then did some more research on video capture, but made no real progress. We then spoke with Victoria and a little later with Paul.</p>
