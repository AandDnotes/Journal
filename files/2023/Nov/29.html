        <h1>Wednesday 29th November</h1>
        <p>A mainly bright and dry day (particularly in the morning), but chilly. I walked down to the book shop and bought a book for Rowan. After lunch Angela went to table tennis as usual.</p>
        <p>I spent quite a bit of time preparing an Adestra email for the next IET Sussex talk. I also prepared a map for the change of venue later next year. Angela continued writing her Christmas letters.</p>
