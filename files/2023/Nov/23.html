        <h1>Thursday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>Most of the 'action' occurred this morning. Angela needed a new electric toothbrush and we wanted to enquire about selling some jewellery and silver-plate items. We looked on the Boots web site to see what they had and then went to the Argos section of Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm. All of the cheap ones were out of stock. So after doing our weekly shop we went to Boots; to find that the cheap toothbrushes were sold out. Back to Sainsbury's to buy one off their shelf.</p>
        <p>Then it was to Waitrose for coffee and to look for small-headed toothbrushes (manual or for electric brushes), which they also did not have, and then to two jewellers. One said they would buy silver plate and the other did not. We also went to a shop to buy ingredients for Angela's 'chewy bars' and looked at some interesting toys.</p>
        <p>After lunch I uploaded the recording of Tuesday's talk to our Sussex YouTube channel. It was a calm, sunny afternoon, but I put off taking the TC for a run until Saturday, which also promises to be fine.</p>
