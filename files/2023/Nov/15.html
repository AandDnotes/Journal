        <h1>Wednesday 15th November</h1>
        <p>It was a bright, sunny day, between a wet day yesterday and a forecast wet day tomorrow. I spent some time this morning replying to some questions that Greg asked about nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis and I created my 'year notes' web page for 2022, along with the entry on the index page. I also looked at photos from this year to record notable events for my Christmas letters. Then I spent some time trying to view the drives on the old laptop from the MacBook and iMac. The reason for this is that the old laptop is the only device with a CD drive. I tried both Linux and Windows 10, but couldn't see either the laptop from the Macs or vice versa. In the process I updated both the Linux and Windows systems.</p>
