        <h1>Sunday 12th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I updated my notes on the Control Technologies workshop and emailed the IET Sussex committee. I also emptied my tool bag from yesterday's Repair Cafe. At that event 'we' repaired out 1,000th item.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul. He is having problems with his internet connection.</p>
