        <h1>Friday 17th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to help set up the church for tomorrow's Christmas fair, getting home just before lunch. It was a sunny, if cold day, which is not the forecast for tomorrow!</p>
        <p>My 'Christmas present' arrived this morning, even though the estimated delivery was December 8th. Two packages, one containing the Tiger Moth kit and one with the receiver and servos. It is very small and will be fiddly to build. Also, it looks as though the connections to the battery and the motor need to be soldered on to the minute receiver/ESC.</p>
        <p>I spent some time 'playing' with the flight simulator and my transmitter. The only indoor micro model that I could find is very sensitive to the aileron controls. I've tried to set up a new model in the transmitter with a 50% reduction in the aileron stick. But I've not yet tested it.</p>
        <p>Angela cooked more cakes for tomorrow.</p>
