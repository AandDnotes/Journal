        <h1>Tuesday 28th November</h1>
        <p>A brighter day, at least during the morning. We started by walking down to the High Street to buy a few things.</p>
        <p>Simon Windust discovered that the train we were due to take on Monday has been cancelled! So we will need to catch the earlier train and hope that our tickets will be accepted.</p>
        <p>I explored the flight simulator on both the old laptop and in a Windows VM, but didn't get any better control.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended the IET Sussex committee meeting.</p>
