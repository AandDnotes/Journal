        <h1>Monday 13th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off mid morning to the church to help set up the lunch club. I read a couple of IET policy documents and then went down to the church. We got home in time for afternoon tea and then Angela tried to make the books balance.</p>
        <p>After some cheese and biscuits I went off to the WSMGOC club night at Washington.</p>
