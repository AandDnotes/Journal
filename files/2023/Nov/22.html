        <h1>Wednesday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>I transferred the video files from the camera SD card to the iMac (via the MacBook), ran all seven files through Handbrake to convert them to 1080P and loaded them into iMovie. I also created a start 'slide' and then pieced the files together, cutting out unwanted parts and adjusting the sound level. Finally it was exported and run through Handbrake again.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis and I went to the dentist to have a check-up.</p>
