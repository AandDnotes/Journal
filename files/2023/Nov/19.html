        <h1>Sunday 19th November</h1>
        <p>A dryer day. Although late in the morning it rained on the washing! Angela went to church and I wrote the template for my Christmas letters, along with changes for each person.</p>
        <p>Eventually in the afternoon we spoke to Paul and then Victoria, who earlier was collecting Austin from Scout camp. Later I had a little 'play' with the flying simulator, but couldn't get the indoor model stable and even the Piper Cub to land.</p>
