        <h1>Sunday 26th November</h1>
        <p>A cold and grey morning, that became damp by lunchtime and raining by the evening. While Angela was at church I formatted the SD card for Mac, but after four hours Time Machine had backed up less than 2%. So I removed it from the list of backup devices and went back to the SSD drive. Then I sorted out the connectors for the Tiger Moth. Later I soldered the battery connector to the receiver and plugged in the servos. I created a new model, but couldn't get it to bind to the transmitter until (even later after some research) I set the model 'modulation type' to 'DSM2 only'. Then I could move the servos. I also prepared some PCB connector for soldering to the receiver and to the motor cables.</p>
        <p>Paul et al were at Greet and Wim's for Wim's birthday, so we couldn't talk to him.</p>
