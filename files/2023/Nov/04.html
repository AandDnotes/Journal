        <h1>Saturday 4th November</h1>
        <p>The rain returned. However, it stopped just before we went to the High Street (in waterproof trousers) to buy a newspaper and some apples on the market and the sun came out. Most of the market had been moved into the Athletic Club. On our way home we called by the free buckets of apples in Newham Lane, picking up three apples. Shortly after we got home it poured with rain!</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria after lunch.</p>
