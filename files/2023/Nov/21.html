        <h1>Tuesday 21st November</h1>
        <p>There was only a little drizzle after lunch. WE had our main meal at one o'clock, since I was going to an IET talk in the evening.</p>
        <p>I prepared and printed the attendance list for the evening's talk. Then I spent quite a lot of time researching a new memory for Time Machine backups. Later I ordered a 512 GB micro SD card and a small usb-c interface device.</p>
        <p>Later still I went to Falmer for the IET talk and videoed it (I hope). It was a good talk, if a little long.</p>
