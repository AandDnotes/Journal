        <h1>Thursday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>The advice today was to stay at home due to the storm that was bringing strong winds and rain to the south coast. So we did. The wind wasn't too strong, but it rained on and off all day.</p>
        <p>Angela sorted out her WI finances now that the branch has been closed down and started shredding papers that will not be required. I spent some time scanning photos taken in 1987 in India, adding them to my web page. I then added the page to our web site and started making notes on what we did in 2022 for the 'events' page.</p>
