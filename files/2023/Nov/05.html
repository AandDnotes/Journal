        <h1>Sunday 5th November</h1>
        <p>Bonfire night and a dryer evening than last night. We can hear a few bangs, but did not plan to go out. In fact, the day was mostly dry, with some sunshine.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I stopped virus notifications appearing on the MacBook and then cleared the tops of the downpipes on the gutters, front and rear. Later, we spoke with Paul and I continued making notes about 2022.</p>
