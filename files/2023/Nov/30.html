        <h1>Thursday 30th November</h1>
        <p>Another chilly day (January temperatures in November), so we dressed up and went out to do the weekly supermarket shop. Before we went, Angela leant on the clothes airer in the study and thee plastic catches broke. So we started at Argos in Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm, where I bought two, three-tier airers, one to go in the study and the other to use in the dining room (the present one we use in there is not very good). Meanwhile, Angela started the food shop.</p>
        <p>We couldn't find a couple of things, so we went to Waitrose to buy them, had coffee and then walked to the library to buy some Christmas cards (50 of them). Fro there we went to Poundland to buy some things for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the High Street and I modified the IET Sussex 'Programme of Events booklet' and checked the venues.</p>
