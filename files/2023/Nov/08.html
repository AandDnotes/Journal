        <h1>Wednesday 8th November</h1>
        <p>I'm not sure that it stopped raining at all today; perhaps one brief spell around lunchtime.</p>
        <p>Apart from a few IET related emails, I spent a lot of the day trying to set up the Lego Mindestorm kit. After getting errors when trying to install the Tower driver on a Windows 11 VM, I did what others had done and installed Windows XP in another VM on the MAcBook. Then I was able to install the Lego RIS software. That then found the Tower, but so far I've failed to get it to communicate with an RCX brick.</p>
        <p>Angela decided, quite rightly, to take the car to table tennis this afternoon.</p>
