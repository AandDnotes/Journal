        <h1>Monday 20th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning to her Monday club, but before she went she remembered that 'collectables' were being bought at the Steyning Centre today. So I spent some time getting my Pentax camera out. I had to remove the leaking batteries in the flash.</p>
        <p>So after lunch we walked down to the Steyning Centre with bags of silver plate, commemorative sovereigns and, of course, the Pentax. There were two assessors and after a short wait we saw one. The coins were only worth 25 pence each, which is what the banks will pay. He said that they could only offer a value of the plate based on their weight and that we would get a lot more from an antiques shop. So we got £5 for the coins and £15 for the camera. But we still have two teapots, a milk jug and a sugar bowl, that take up a lot of space.</p>
