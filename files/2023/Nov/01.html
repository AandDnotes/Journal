        <h1>Wednesday 1st November</h1>
        <p>All day we have been listening to warnings about the storm that is expected to sweep along the south coast over night and tomorrow. So we decided not to try to go shopping tomorrow and Angela went to the High Street to get things that we might need. In fact she went out about three times, including going to table tennis, although she did take the car on that occasion.</p>
        <p>I spent quite some time transcribing the notes from my follow-up trip to India in 1987. I now just need to find some photos to go with the notes.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning film show to see Allelujah. It was a good film, a little depressing and perhaps too much of a propaganda film for the NHS. It was getting quite windy (and was raining) by the time I walked home.</p>
