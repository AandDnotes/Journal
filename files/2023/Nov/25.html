        <h1>Saturday 25th November</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but very cold day. Luckily there was little in the way of wind. So it was long pants and wooly hat time. As usual we started with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also got some cash, which was handy, since the window cleaner came.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts and looking at the battery and connectors that I bought yesterday.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started the TC and took it on my figure of eight test route. It only just started before the battery gave up and took a while to warm up, but it ran well. The reason for the test run was to check the oil and coolant levels after changing both a few weeks ago. So later in the afternoon I checked them and both were fine.</p>
        <p>After my outing we spoke with Victoria. It was even colder with them.</p>
