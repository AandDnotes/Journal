        <h1>Saturday 18th November</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was bad for today and I took Angela, with her cakes, down to the church. Then I walked back down to buy a newspaper and then sit in the hall to sell lunch tickets (slightly fewer than last year). We had our lunch at two, at the close of the Christmas Bazaar. With the Brownies (and their parents) and the singers, the whole place was 'buzzing'. Angela worked hard in the kitchen all day. I sat down for most of it.</p>
        <p>Later I did the weekly accounts, reconciling my spreadsheet against the bank statement, but we didn't do a lot.</p>
