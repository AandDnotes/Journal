        <h1>Thursday 9th November</h1>
        <p>After some early rain it stayed dry for much of the day. We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. Then, not finding any horticultural grit in B&amp;Q we went to Squires via Rogers Farm, which was closed.</p>
        <p>So most of the morning was over. Later Angela went to the library and I tried various communications options for the RCX, to no avail. I then installed CoCo and used it to install the Tower driver that came with it. However, when I tried installing the firmware from CoCo I got the same error.</p>
