        <h1>Thursday 16th November</h1>
        <p>The day started wet and stayed wet for the rest of the day. We decided to go to Holmebush so as to avoid the Bostal Road and so went to M&amp;S and then to Tesco to do the weekly shop. It also gave us the opportunity to look around M&amp;S and then Next. We bought some small presents for Paul, Krista and Rowan and Angela bought a new cardigan.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon Angela cooked some more cakes and I installed the Phoenix flight simulator on the Windows 11 Virtual Machine on the iMac. I have yet to plug in the transmitter and try it. I had to convert the contents of the installation CD into an iso image for the installation to work. I also made additions to my 2023 events notes to help with my Christmas letters.</p>
