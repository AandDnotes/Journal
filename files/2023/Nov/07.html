        <h1>Tuesday 7th November</h1>
        <p>I didn't sleep well last night, but at least the Banggood site says that the refund has been approved. So I ordered the receiver/servos with the right option. The refund was not yet in the credit card account, so I must continue to check.</p>
        <p>After printing the attendance list for this evening's IET talk, I put a coat of stain on the shed, which I finished just in time for lunch. This was our main meal, since I am out this evening.</p>
        <p>Later I tried to install the Lego Mindstorm RIS software, but it gave an error message when trying to install the 'tower' driver. Later still, I went to the Hawth for the talk on 'Crop circles'. It was impressive and interesting, although quite different to our usual talks.</p>
