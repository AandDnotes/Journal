        <h1>Monday 6th November</h1>
        <p>Surprisingly the sun was shining when we got up and stayed out for most of the day. While Angela went to her Monday group I took the back off the TV because the sound vibrations had started again. I found that the insulation tape that I'd used had come un-stuck. So I replaced it with duct tape. There are a lot of screws!</p>
        <p>My new credit card arrived. So I ordered our plane tickets to go to Rotterdam and our train tickets to get to Victoria. I found that tube and DLR tickets are bought by tapping in and out using a contactless card. And it is cheaper (off-peak) for a single than buying an anytime day ticket.</p>
        <p>I then tried to buy the indoor plane kit and receiver/servos. I ordered them, although the mbna sms was somewhat odd. Later I realised that I hadn't specified the receiver type. So I tried to get a refund for that, so as to order the right one.</p>
