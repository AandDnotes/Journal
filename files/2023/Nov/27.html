        <h1>Monday 27th November</h1>
        <p>The day started wet, became brighter during the morning and then rained later. Angela went to her Monday club and I ordered my Sussex Wanderers 'Christmas' meal. I will have eaten two Christmas lunches before the run, so ordered crispy duck salad!</p>
        <p>I soldered the motor connections for the Tiger Moth and then tested that all the servos and the motor worked (and in the right direction). I had to bind the receiver again. Perhaps it doesn't retain the setting. A little later I also soldered a plug on to the battery charging adapter lead. The indoor model on the simulator, when running on the old laptop, seemed a little easier to control, but it still requires right ailerons to make it go straight.</p>
        <p>After we spoke with Paul (they were out yesterday), I got around to printing one of my Christmas letters. Angela decided to write hers long-hand so as to give her hand some exercise. She also cooked some ginger biscuits. The washing machine decided to have a bit of a wobble. It gave an error code implying that the water pressure was low or the filter blocked. Restarting it worked, although the time remaining did jump quite a few minutes.</p>
