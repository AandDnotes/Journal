        <h1>Saturday 11th November</h1>
        <p>Armistice Day. It was sunny and calm, if chilly, from sunrise to sunset. We started with a walk to the High Street to get some cash and to buy a few things, including a newspaper.Then Angela worked in the garden and I did the weekly accounts, followed by putting my tools in the bag ready for the afternoon.</p>
        <p>So after lunch I went to the Repair Cafe and Angela washed flowerpots. I fixed an industrial mixer and rewired a hedge cutter cable. Then most of us went to the Red Lion for a drink, since there is no Cafe in December.</p>
        <p>Since I was late home, we postponed our chat with Victoria.</p>
