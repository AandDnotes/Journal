        <h1>Tuesday 14th November</h1>
        <p>A very wet morning. Luckily it more or less stopped raining before Angela went to the High Street. And it was looking much brighter before I left for Field Place to see a talk on the use of hydrogen in steel making. There was not enough of an overview of the steel-making process and there were too many figures that had no real meaning (to the uninitiated).</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at midday, since Angela was going out in the evening. She was helping to provide tea and coffee at a talk from an author about his book. I attended a BMFA webinar on drone 'pictures'.</p>
