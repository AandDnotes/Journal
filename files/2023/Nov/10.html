        <h1>Friday 10th November</h1>
        <p>The morning was very wet, so we didn't go outside until after lunch. I generated the next Adestra email, advertising the next IET Sussex talks, and submitted it for approval.</p>
        <p>Angela put grit on the surface of pots and I swept up leaves and seeds from the drive. We also met our new neighbour opposite, Ian.</p>
        <p>I took apart one of the RCX bricks, but could not see anything obvious that could have failed, apart from some electrolytic condensers, but these didn't look as though they had anything to do with the infra-red communications.</p>
