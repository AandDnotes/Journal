        <h1>Friday 24th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street and I dealt with some email.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drove Angela to Worthing Hospital for her appointment with ENT. I dropped her at the entrance and went off to the model shop to get a battery, glue and some connectors. I was driving back to park near the hospital when Angela phoned to say that she had finished. So we went to Waitrose for a cup of tea and to buy some apples. We also bought a Christmas cake.</p>
