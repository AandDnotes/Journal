        <h1>Friday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>The wind had calmed and it was a brighter, dryer day. We started by walking to the High Street to 'finish' the weekly shop. After the butcher we diverted into Victoria's Sponge for a coffee.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the afternoon tidying the gardens, particularly removing leaves from the front. I made more notes from my journal for 2022.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we walked to the Methodist Church for an evening of shuffleboard. It was a good evening. Angela's team of three (Dolls) came last and my team of three (Guys) can first.</p>
