        <h1>Wednesday 27th September</h1>
        <p>I started the day, rather late, by emailing the IET Sussex Network committee with information requested during yesterday's committee meeting. I also managed to get the Office 365 calendar combined with my iCloud calendar. Later I emailed Mike W about collecting the Control Technology workshop equipment and arranged to go to his house on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>I received a text about booking a Covid jab. So we booked appointments for us both to go to Ashington on Monday afternoon. Then I upgraded the OS on the iMac. It is a major version called Sonoma.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela was at table tennis, I went for a walk (the same as yesterday), but took a plastic bag and collected some blackberries, which I've frozen. I also started looking at advertising an IMechE talk to our IET members.</p>
