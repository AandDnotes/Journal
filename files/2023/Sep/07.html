        <h1>Thursday 7th September</h1>
        <p>Another hot day and quite a busy one. Since Angela had to shop for Monday's lunch club we went to Holmebush to do our weekly shop. As usual, particularly with a look at some things in M&amp;S, that took most of the morning. However, I did get a chance to reply to an email from Mike W and to make a temporary modification to the IET Sussex home page. I also emailed Colin C about my inability to make the next PEI meeting. Later I sent out the reminder to the group. I must send some notes to Mike U.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the opticians for an eye test. The cataract in my right eye has developed quite quickly over the past year. I had the choice of requesting an operation or getting some reading glasses and be tested again in six months. I chose the latter. So I left my old driving glasses frames (which I don't need) for the new lenses to be fitted into. An operation would be done at SpaMedica at Sayers Common with a 4-6 weeks wait for an assessment and then another 4-6 weeks for the operation.</p>
        <p>After the optician, I went to the health centre to arrange a flu jab. Angela already has one booked for this month. I need to wait until October. They have not yet heard anything about Covid jabs.</p>
