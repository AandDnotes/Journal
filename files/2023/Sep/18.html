        <h1>Monday 18th September</h1>
        <p>Last night, when we went to bed, there was almost continuous thunder and lightning. Shortly afterwards we had torrential rain, although the storms did not pass over us.</p>
        <p>Again, this morning we had heavy rain. Angela got a bit wet going to her Monday group, although it had stopped raining by the time she came home. She had already been down to the High Street to get some milk, since the milkman did not deliver as we had expected.</p>
        <p>I unpacked the futon mattress, put it in its cover and arranged it on the chair. Later in the day we emptied the bookcase, moved it on to the end wall and put the futon where we think it will live. I now need to screw the bookcase to the wall and then we can sort out the books. Then I checked that my Python AI programme still ran on the old laptop (albeit with odd colours) and checked the ported presentation against the 'master' on the MacBook, making an update.</p>
        <p>After looking again at the 'repair cafe' iron, I had more or less decided to tell the owner that it could not be taken apart. Some posts on how to do so said that it was impossible, so I just glued a broken dial and part of the handle cover (which I'd removed looking for screws). However, I then found a site that described the location of some hidden screws. I now have the top off, but still can't yet get at the wiring. But there are some more screws!</p>
