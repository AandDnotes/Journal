        <h1>Friday 1st September</h1>
        <p>The drizzle soon stopped and by late afternoon the clouds cleared and it was a sunny and warmer evening. Alan called quite early to say that Laura's dog was better and that both he and Christine would be able to come tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We then drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Brighton. After coffee we looked in a few outdoor clothing shops and then bought a new kettle in Robert Dyas. We then found the futon shop and ordered a chair-sized futon in birch and with an olive green cover. It should leave the warehouse on the 11th and we will get a call from the delivery company to arrange a date/time for delivery.</p>
        <p>In the basement of a fabric shop we found a curtain material that should work in the dining room. We noted the design, cost, width and repeat. Then, after looking in more outdoor clothing shops I bought a new kagool in Tresspass, reduced from nearly £100 to less than £40. It is waterproof, with taped seams, and has an adjustable hood, but is not breathable.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch in M&amp;S we queued near Churchill Square for a bus back. We waited for half an hour (they are notionally ever 15 minutes). Then the first was full and we just found seats on the second. We finally got home at four o'clock.</p>
