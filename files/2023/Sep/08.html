        <h1>Friday 8th September</h1>
        <p>Although it was warm and dry, it was mostly cloudy. Angela went to the High Street and cut all the grass. I modified some IET Sussex pages and had them rejected! I also collected together my tools for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
        <p>So quite a quiet day, although I also started exploring how I could replace the EngX blog pages with html pages on Github. Otherwise I printed off a poster for Angela's McMillan coffee morning and printed some maps around Bury St Edmunds.</p>
