        <h1>Wednesday 6th September</h1>
        <p>It was very hot today. I saw out outside thermometer show 28 degrees before lunchtime. Later, the sun was hazy and so not quite so hot.</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela walked to the High Street, I started cleaning the underside of the offside of the TC. I finished that later in the afternoon, while Angela was at table tennis, the first of the season. I later prepared some words for an advertisement to sell the TC.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre film night to see 'Living', with Bill Nighy. It was very slow (even slower than a normal Bill Nighy film), but quite a good film.</p>
