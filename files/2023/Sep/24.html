        <h1>Sunday 24th September</h1>
        <p>Angela set off to church early, complete with trifle. It was harvest festival and, luckily for me, she brought half the trifle home. I started by oiling the garden table and chairs. It took less oil than I thought it would. Perhaps I didn't put enough on.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning (apart from drinking coffee and reading the paper) generating the reminders to IET Sussex members about the first two talks. I sent them for approval after lunch, which was really about four days late! I also sent the posters (for the words) and the images to Mark and Dan for social media.</p>
        <p>Later we had our usual conversation with Paul. We didn't see Rowan, only heard her.</p>
