        <h1>Thursday 14th September</h1>
        <p>We had showered, had breakfast and done our Dutch lessons before Kate and Dick knocked on our bedroom door at ten o'clock. We went to the tourist information shop and bought tickets for a guided tour of the cathedral, only to find that it had been cancelled due to a service. So Dick got his money back. Prior to the expected tour we walked to the theatre, only to find that they were running workshops and so we couldn't go in to look around.</p>
        <p>So we had a long coffee break in the cathedral cafe and then walked around some back streets in Bury, returning to the cafe for lunch, which again took some time. So much so that we missed the opening time of St Mary's church, which is said to have an interesting roof structure. We did, however, have ice cream in the cathedral gardens walk around the inside of the cathedral.</p>
        <p>Later we walked into the restaurant street and had pizza. Another fine day.</p>
