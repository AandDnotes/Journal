        <h1>Saturday 30th September</h1>
        <p>We went off to the High Street perhaps a little later than usual (after showing) to buy a newspaper and some mushrooms. It was sunny, if not particularly warm, but more cloud came in as the day went on.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday morning, I did the weekly accounts. Afterwards I investigated using github to store the CoCo files for the Control Technologies workshop. I think I will need to zip up those files that are needed for installation, but need to find out which files are actually needed. However, I need a Windows system without CoCo already installed. I could create a web page with a download button to download the zip file.ÃŸ</p>
