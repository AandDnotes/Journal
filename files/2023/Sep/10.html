        <h1>Sunday 10th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I reconciled my accounts against the bank statement that arrived yesterday. Then I started looking at the kettle that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. At the moment I can't see how to remove the switch mechanism. But even if I could, I don't think that I will be able to get at the contact that seems to be failing to close.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and a little later with Paul. They had been visiting Greet and Wim in the forest and had been to the zoo.</p>
        <p>It was a mainly cloudy, but warm day, with a few spots of rain later in the afternoon. Then the sun came out, making it difficult to see the iPad screen.</p>
        <p>This morning I found some suitable sized pieces of corrugated card in which to wrap Kate's Christmas present. I had to glue some patches over what had been hand holds and then later bend up the edges. The tape didn't stick well, but Angela then covered it in Christmas wrapping paper.</p>
