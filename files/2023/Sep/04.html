        <h1>Monday 4th September</h1>
        <p>Chris and Alan left after a relatively early and light breakfast. Our day was then really about catching up. I did my Dutch lesson and didn't seem to lose my streak (I didn't do a lesson yesterday). Angela went to her Monday morning group and I updated my journal for the last two days. I also removed the South Downs Run plaque from the TC and found that the front carburettor is still leaking, although less petrol was used than I had expected.</p>
        <p>When trying to update my 'milage' spreadsheet I found that Google Drive on the iMac was not updating files. Later I discovered that the iMac was set to 'steam' files rather than 'mirror' them. Changing the option seemed to fix the problem.</p>
        <p>I updated my 'Outings' page on the TC website to add some photos and notes on the South Downs Run. Later we caught up with Paul. Rowan and Krista are off on the school camp for the next three days. so Paul has to look after the animals. They are away next weekend to join Greet and Wim who are away to celebrate their Golden Wedding anniversary.</p>
