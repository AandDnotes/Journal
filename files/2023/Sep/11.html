        <h1>Monday 11th September</h1>
        <p>Angela was off early to start preparing for the lunch club. She was cooking today. Before going down (a little too early) I managed to get the kettle (from the Repair Cafe) working, apart from the lights.</p>
        <p>Just before we finished clearing up I had a text from the optician to say that my glasses were ready, so I collected them on my way home. I tried them in the shop, reading a card, however, when I tried using the laptop I found that I could see clearly through the middle of the lenses, but looking through the top or the bottom of the lens I could see double. So I phoned them and took the glasses back. They checked the prescription and said that, because each eye is now so different, my brain has to get used to the difference. So they suggested that I try them for a week or two.</p>
        <p>Later I did a PAT test on the kettle and phoned the owner. She will call for it tomorrow, after four thirty.</p>
        <p>I had quite a large lunch, so I didn't have anything before going to the MG club night (in the TC). I had some garlic bread and later had to drive home in the dark with the TC's poor lights. They were actually better than I had remembered.</p>
