        <h1>Saturday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>Angela was up early to firstly get her flu jab and meet some other church members to go to a 'safeguarding' workshop in Worthing. She got back at about 2:30. I made bread (in the machine), did the weekly accounts and transcribed another day's notes from my India journal.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the top off the bay bush in the front garden. Then we spoke with Victoria. It was Juniper's birthday, but wouldn't say anything.</p>
