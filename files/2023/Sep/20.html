        <h1>Wednesday 20th September</h1>
        <p>Dry this morning and very wet this afternoon, but windy all day. It was also a fairly productive day. I made updates to the IET Sussex home page and replied to a number of email. Then I managed to get the Repair Cafe iron apart and replace the cable with the longer one. Luckily I was then able to put it all back together. I did a PAT and tested it. Initially it made a few 'pops' when the thermostat turned off, but then seemed okay. It was probably some water flashing off. So I phoned the owner, who will collect it tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and later I had a Teams meeting with Dan, the new Sussex Network chair.</p>
        <p>Just after eight the TV signal failed, probably due to heavy rain, so we switched to iPlayer to watch The Repair Shop. Then at about ten o'clock we had a short power cut. The power came back on just after we found the torch. Then it went off again at 10:35.</p>
