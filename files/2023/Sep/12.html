        <h1>Tuesday 12th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to Storrington again, to bank a lunch club cheque and find out how to remove a signatory from the lunch club account. Meanwhile I did a PAT on the kettle I'd brought home from the Repair Cafe (I had to clean the earth connection), checked the Panda tyres, oil and water, then paid for our Dartford Crossing tolls. I also printed another map, showing our arrival in Bury St Edmunds from the south. A little later I got a case down from the attic.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a Teams call with Lisa and Julie about using EngX. Once Lisa confirms that they have changed an option I will need to rework the Sussex home page. I then sent an update to Mike (copying dave and Dan). I also sent Julie a paragraph about myself, along with a new photo.</p>
        <p>The kettle was collected by the owner. I will need to tell Robin.</p>
