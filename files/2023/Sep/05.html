        <h1>Tuesday 5th September</h1>
        <p>It was another hot, sunny day. In fact, during the afternoon our outside thermometer was showing 28 degrees. There was also only a gentle breeze.</p>
        <p>Angela caught the bus to Storrington this morning to go to the bank about closing her WI account. Meanwhile, I updated my TC web site and asked Alan for a copy of the video that Chis had taken as we arrived at the Western Lawns on Sunday. Then I cleaned parts of the TC's engine compartment (including the underside of the bonnet).</p>
        <p>After lunch I put a bottle jack under the nearside front suspension, removed the wheel and cleaned under the wing. Then I did the same at the rear. Cleaning the offside will have to wait for another day. I also trimmed the video that Alan had sent via Whatsapp and added it to my TC 'Outings' page. Later I uploaded it to Google Photos, so that Victoria and Paul could see it.</p>
