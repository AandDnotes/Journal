        <h1>Saturday 8th September</h1>
        <p>Another hot, sunny and busy day. Since Angela was waiting for a phone call, I walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then I did the weekly accounts (not knowing that a bank statement would arrive later) while Angela and Shiela visited Lillian at Valerie Manor. Apparently she slept all the time that they were there.</p>
        <p>Then I started working out how I could reproduce something resembling the EngX pages. I am attempting to make them suitable for any size of device and adapt as the size of the browser changes and the orientation os a phone changes.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. After fixing one of our extension leads, I repaired a hand-held vacuum cleaner, 'broke' part of a steam iron, which I have brought home to try to find a way to take apart, and started looking at a kettle that does not work (which I also brought home). I also decided that the micro-switch on a 45 year old Flymo had broken and that we were unlikely to find a replacement.</p>
