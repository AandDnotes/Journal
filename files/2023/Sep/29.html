        <h1>Friday 29th September</h1>
        <p>Luckily I heard that the IMechE talk has been postponed before I sent my email for approval. We then set off early (no shower) to the church to set up for the McMillan coffee morning. It started at ten, but by 10:30 there was just Phylis, Sandy, Angela and I. Then one lady (from The Ridings) arrived and by eleven we had to set up more tables. Angela made quite a bit more than last year and might be able to sell more cakes on Sunday. After clearing up we gat home just before one.</p>
        <p>Later I found the CoCo installation CD and updated the Windows OS.</p>
