        <h1>Thursday 21st September</h1>
        <p>The repaired steam iron was collected by its owner and then Angela went out to get a signature on a cheque. Meanwhile I sent some email and paid my RCEA membership. I then started compiling some notes on the PEI Group meeting from the recording.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went off to Lyons Farm to do our weekly shop, getting home just after three. So I finished my notes and sent them out. I copied them to Dan.</p>
