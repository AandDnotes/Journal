        <h1>Saturday 16th September</h1>
        <p>There were more people at breakfast this morning, probably because it was Saturday. Afterwards we walked into the town to buy a newspaper. Then we did our Dutch lessons before saying goodbye to Kate and Dick.</p>
        <p>We set off at 10:45, heading to Hatfield Forest for lunch. It took a little longer than planned, since I got in the wrong lane at one point and we took a convoluted route rather than turn around and join the queue. But we got to Hatfield Forest in time for lunch. We were then home by 3:15 after a good journey in the (slightly hazy) sunshine.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street to buy a few food items, while I uploaded some photos and read the paper!</p>
