        <h1>Monday 25th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off around 10am to attend and help at Lillian's funeral. She didn't get home until 4:30. I started by following the advice from the Futon Company by laying out the futon and removing the cover. Later I put it all back together.</p>
        <p>My Adestra email was rejected because the starting time of the first talk was different to that on the registration site. It turned out that Dave P had made a mistake! Julie corrected it and approved my email. Then I cleared weeds from the drive.</p>
        <p>I glued together the broken pieces of the Australian book ends and also emailed Simon K about suggestions for selling the TC.</p>
