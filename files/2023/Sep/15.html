        <h1>Friday 15th September</h1>
        <p>It was the same procedure as yesterday. We went down for breakfast and then waited in our room, doing our Dutch lessons, until Kate and Dick knocked at around ten.</p>
        <p>Another fine day. So we walked to the pub around the corner to book a table for dinner tonight and then went into St Mary's church. It is bigger than the cathedral and the largest parish church in the UK. Mary Tudor is buried there and it has a magnificent hammer beam roof.</p>
        <p>Then we drove off to Ikworth House, only a few miles to the south. We had both morning tea and lunch there, looking around the house (a rotunda with a wing either side) and walking a little around the grounds in between. We were back at the hotel by four.</p>
        <p>Our meal at the Dog & Partridge was not quite as we had expected. We all wanted fish & chips, but they only had two portions left. So Kate and I had steak and ale pie. We couldn't eat it all. Also, the pub was a bit too noisy for us to easily hold a conversation.</p>
