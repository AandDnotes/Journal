        <h1>Friday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street and to help Sandy at the church. I moved some money into Victoria's Halifax account for Juniper's birthday. I also failed to set the maturity options for a Tesco bond because it is a joint account and we both need to sign in! I phoned them and they are sending me a security code.</p>
        <p>Having more or less removed the small blood spots on the Z-bed mattress, I phoned GuildCare to see if they would collect it. But they said they would not collect such a 'cheap' item. So we moved the bed down stairs and tried to fit it in the car. I'd measured it and thought it might just fit, but it didn't. So I book a collection from the British Heart Foundation (for October).</p>
        <p>We also moved a small bookcase up into the study and filled it with books.</p>
