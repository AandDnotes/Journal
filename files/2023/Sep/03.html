        <h1>Sunday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>Wow, what a fantastic day. It was the South Downs Run, so Alan and I set off for Whiteways Lodge at 8:15 in the TC, arriving at ten to nine for our spell at marshalling. I registered (we were number 3) and fixed the plate to the front of the car. It was cool and a little misty when we left home, but became very misty on the way. I had to turn on the headlights.</p>
        <p>There was an almost constant stream of cars coming in and soon people started setting off on the run. By 10:45 nearly everyone had arrived and quite a few had departed, so there was little need for marshalling and we set off. The route booklet showed 195 entrants, but it seems that a few registered after the booklet went to press, so there were 202 cars, with only a handful of non-MGs By this time the sun was shining. We stopped at Bramber of a drink, but otherwise only stopped for a loo break.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela and Chis made some picnic lunch, drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Brighton. From there they took the number 13 to Eastbourne pier. Alan and I arrived just before half past two (the run was 75 miles down some quite slow roads), and Angela and Chis had been there for an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>We sat on a bench on the promenade to have our lunch, then looked at the cars and had an ice cream. The sun was slightly hazy, with a light breeze off the sea, which meant that it was very pleasant. We walked towards the pier and at the bandstand Chris and Angela continued on to catch a bus home, while Alan and I walked back to the car.</p>
        <p>Apart fro a detour to Beachy Head, we followed the A259 along to Shoreham, taking a wrong turn in Newhaven (and needing to turn around) and finding ourselves in a bus lane at Telscombe Cliffs (perhaps I will receive a fine). We got home at five to six, having driven a total of 131 miles in the TC. It was another hour before Chris and Angela got home. After a glass of wine (sitting int he garden) we walked to the White Horse for a meal, which was very good. It was still quite warm when we walked home.</p>
