        <h1>Wednesday 13th September</h1>
        <p>We packed, shut down the house and left for Bury St Edmunds at 10:45. After a slight wrong turn we stopped for lunch at Hatfield Forest, a National Trust nature reserve near Stansted Airport, for lunch. We then arrived at the Premier Inn at Bury St Edmunds at 3:15. Dick and Kate arrived about half an hour later.</p>
        <p>The four of us walked to the Cathedral cafe for a cup of tea and then took a walk along the main eatery street. We decided on a Thai restaurant called the Giggly Squid. I remembered why I am not that keen on Thai food. We were back in the hotel room a little after nine thirty.</p>
