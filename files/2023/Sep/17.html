        <h1>Sunday 17th September</h1>
        <p>It was a day of sunshine and thunder storms. I started by cutting the grass, then put on some bread to cook before practicing my ML presentation. It took me 45 minutes. Then, while reading the paper, the rain spots started to fall, so I went out to bring in the washing, luckily, just before the heavens emptied.</p>
        <p>After lunch, just before talking with Victoria, our futon chair arrived. It came in two boxes, a package and a large plastic bag. After talking with Victoria and then with Paul, I built the frame and we cut up the larger of the two boxes. Rowan had got 10+ in her geography test, which means that she got all the questions right and spelt everything correctly.</p>
