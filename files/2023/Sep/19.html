        <h1>Tuesday 19th September</h1>
        <p>Whilst Angela went to the High Street I screwed the bookcase to the wall. Angela then put most of the books back. However, there is still a pile of my books to sort out.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA AGM and talk, except that I was giving the talk! I had a chance to test the interface of my MacBook to the projector and test my AI program with the light levels. The AGM then only took twenty minutes. From my point of view the talk went well, but it seemed to receive a mixed response. Although I had finished the presentation just after the tea arrived, some found it interesting and some found it boring and of little relevance.</p>
