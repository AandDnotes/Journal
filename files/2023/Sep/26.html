        <h1>Tuesday 26th September</h1>
        <p>Angela spent most of the morning in the High Street and doing something at the church. Meanwhile I created the start slide for next week's talk and mapped out the talk advertising process.</p>
        <p>It was a dry and quite warm day, so after lunch I went for a 35 minute walk while Angela worked in the garden.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the IET Sussex committee meeting, which went on for over two hours.</p>
