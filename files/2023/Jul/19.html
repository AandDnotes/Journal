        <h1>Wednesday 19th July</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. As usual, Angela went walking with her (ex)WI group. Later in the day she went down to the High Street to have her hair cut. I reassembled the hedge cutter, only to find (before I had finished) that I had one screw left. So after lunch I took it apart again and concluded that I had as many holes as I had screws. However, when I put it back together I still had a screw left over! Nevertheless I did a PAT test and all seemed well. I also did a visual inspection of the cable and the inside of the plugs, partially rewiring the 13amp plug, and cleaned the outside of the cutter. It seemed to run all right, although there were some sparks coming out of the air vents. I think these were just due to muck on the commutator, but I will run it again to check. Later I texted the owner to say that it was fixed and I would take it to the next Repair Cafe.</p>
