        <h1>Thursday 13th July</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday morning we went off to do the weekly supermarket shop. We went to Lyons Farm and then went on to Rogers Farm for coffee, getting home at about 12:15. We had a sharp shower as we were on the Bostal, but it was otherwise dry with some sunshine. In fact it was quite hot in the cafe and car.</p>
        <p>After lunch I worked out how to re-assemble the hedge trimmer (mostly) and took apart the micro-switch. I then spent quite some time trying to work out how to re-assemble it; and failed! However, I later found some images that might help.</p>
        <p>I also had a visit from Joe, one of the Repair Cafe team, to use the PAT tester on a steam iron that he had repaired.</p>
        <p>After dinner I looked up the Chichester Theatre times/prices and emailed Paul to see if Rowan (or all of them) would like to go while they are here.</p>
