        <h1>Saturday 8th July</h1>
        <p>Our day started with a power cut; luckily after breakfast. Angela had planned to go to Holmbush to by things for Monday's lunch club. However, I couldn't open the garage door. There is a cord to pull to disengage the motor, but I then couldn't find a way to raise the door. So we went to the High Street to buy a newspaper. A little later the power came on.</p>
        <p>Buying the lunch club food was destined to be difficult. Angela went off, but returned to say that the A283 down to Shoreham was closed due to an accident. So she went over the Bostal, but couldn't get all she needed in Tesco and so went to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm, with more traffic congestion.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went off to the 'Repair Cafe' at Beeding. I spent a long time trying to get at the innards of a vacuum cleaner, then came to the conclusion that the motor had failed. Then I looked at a lamp that would not work, but did.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria. Things don't seem to be progressing with the children.</p>
