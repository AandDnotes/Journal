        <h1>Sunday 9th July</h1>
        <p>It was a very early start; I got up at 5:30 and left at 6:45! Nevertheless I was early at Goodwood motor circuit for the 'Gathering of Goblins'. Once all the volunteers had arrived we all had a briefing and then checked the cars against a safety checklist. There were 71 cars, a mixture of Goblin 1s and Goblin 2s. Then I was the timekeeper for one of the two slalom tracks. Each team (of six) could have up to six runs. This took the rest of the day, with a half-hour break for lunch. There was a little rain in the morning, which meant that my score sheets got a bit soggy, but it became brighter after lunch.</p>
        <p>There were also drag races, time trials and something called 'pit stop', but I didn't see those. Once the slalom had finished, all the cars did a circuit of the track. I left just as they were finishing, although there was another run planned and then the award of prizes. But I was exhausted. I got home at about 5:30.</p>
        <p>After dinner we had a quick word with Paul and Rowan.</p>
