        <h1>Monday 10th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off fairly early to set up the lunch club. She was cooking today. During the morning I got a call from Phylis, asking if I could take the money, so I went a little earlier than planned. Before then I completed my notes on the last PEI group meeting and sent it out. The new telephone power adapter arrived and, luckily it worked. I also checked over the TC.</p>
        <p>So I went to lunch club a little earlier than planned. We were home by 3:30.</p>
        <p>After tea, I took the TC to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington.I came home before it got too dark.</p>
