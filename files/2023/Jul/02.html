        <h1>Sunday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church and I finished the monthly accounts. I still have to try to convert our Virgin easy access ISAs to one-year ISAs.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we spoke with Paul. They are still having the top floor ceilings lowered and next week they are starting to have a new drive laid.</p>
