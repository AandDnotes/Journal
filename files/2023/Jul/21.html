        <h1>Friday 21st July</h1>
        <p>Just after 8:30 this morning, before I had a shower, I phoned the health centre to make an appointment to see a doctor about my feet/legs and managed to get one at 11:30. So I didn't do a lot before walking down to the health centre to see Dr Bennet. He explained how the nerves run down the legs, felt my back, tested my leg responses/strength and thought that my problem may be due to a vitamin B12 deficiency. He asked me to make an appointment for a blood test, which I did, saying that the next step, if B12 wasn't to blame, would be a referral to the neurology department at Worthing hospital.</p>
        <p>I had intended to start looking at the TC after lunch, but I was still concerned about the 'extra' screw on the hedge cutter and the 'sparks' coming out of the air vents. So I stripped the machine down again and found where the screw fits. I also re-glued the broken piece of plastic on the lever. I couldn't find any reason for the sparks. So I didn't start on the car.</p>
