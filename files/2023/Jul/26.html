        <h1>Wednesday 26th July</h1>
        <p>It seems that having nothing in the diary doesn't stop it being busy. While Angela went walking I started by clearing out the gutters. They were quite bunged up. Then I opened up the tonneau area of the TC, topped up the differential and checked the dampers. I put things back after lunch.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon, Angela planted out some (all but three) of the plants she bought yesterday. I deleted files to reduce the iCloud content, but then discovered that I had selected (or it was selected by default) to put Documents and Desktop on iCloud. So Migration Assistant had put my Documents folder from the old iMac into a folder and uploaded it to iCloud. However, when I removed the option, the Documents folder was deleted. So I had to copy the files across and still have iCloud to sort out.</p>
        <p>It was dry and partly sunny until quite late, when it started raining.</p>
