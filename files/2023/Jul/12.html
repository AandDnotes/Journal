        <h1>Wednesday 12th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking group this morning. They caught the bus to Shoreham and walked back. A little later David F-B came and we set off in the TC for Warnham and the meeting of the Sussex Wanderers. We then went off on a run around some very twisty Surrey lanes. After lunch back at Warnham we drove back home, arriving at about 3:30. The TC did a total of 70 miles. We got just a little wet both on the way to and from Warnham, but the run itself was dry and quite sunny.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela went to Tottington Manor for afternoon tea with friends from the table tennis club.</p>
