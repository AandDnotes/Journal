        <h1>Thursday 6th July</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and a warm dry one. We set off fairly early (for us) to go to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. While Angela went into Sainsbury's, I went to B&amp;Q to buy a tool bag and head torch. Neither were on display, but they were able to get them from stock on top of diplay racks. The tool bag is larger than I really wanted, but they didn't seem to have any knowledge of the smaller one.</p>
        <p>After grocery shopping we drove to Spring Gardens, firstly for coffee and then to pick some fruit. We picked a large punnet of gooseberries and small punnets of raspberries and blackcurrants.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while sorting out tools for Saturday's Repair Cafe, FEliocity and John came over for a cup of tea and a chat. Afterwards, I pruned back some plant growth coming over from Lynn's.</p>
