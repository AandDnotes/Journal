        <h1>Wednesday 5th July</h1>
        <p>It seemed to be a day mainly about fixing things (or trying to). To start, Angela went off with her walking group. I started looking at the PEI meeting that I missed, at least trying to find images that needed amending due to the new members.</p>
        <p>I did small jobs such as trying to fix the bedroom phone charger and changing a battery in the kitchen clock. I will need to buy a new power adapter.</p>
        <p>We had an appointment booked for a service of our boiler. It was set for between 12:00 and 18:00, but he didn't come until about 5:30.</p>
        <p>We had dinner early and I went to the film show at the Steyning Centre. I saw 'A Man Called Otto', which was very good. Angela didn't go because she didn't think she would be able to hear it.</p>
