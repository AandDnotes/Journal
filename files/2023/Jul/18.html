        <h1>Tuesday 18th July</h1>
        <p>A good (sunny and calm) day. We started by driving to Sheffield Park, getting there in time to have a coffee outside. We walked around the gardens before having lunch, including scones with jam and clotted cream. We then went back in, walked some other paths and bought a Christmas present for Kate.</p>
        <p>The route we took was directed by Google Maps, but we took our own, simpler route home, getting home at about 3:30. On the way home my right leg became numb and Angela had to take over the driving.</p>
        <p>The spade collectors had been delivered, so I fitted them to the wires in the hedge trimmer, cutting off parts of the old connectors and soldering on the new ones and fitted the new micro-switch. I then spent some time trying to work out how to reassemble the device.</p>
