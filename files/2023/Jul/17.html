        <h1>Monday 17th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday morning get together I made a quick change to my Adestra email (I'd forgotten to change the subject line) and re-submitted it. Shortly after it was approved and issued. I forwarded a copy to the person who had asked the questions, pointing out that there were already replies. Then I cleaned up (as best I could) the inside of the hedge trimmer and put some fresh grease on the moving parts.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I spent some time checking the tyre pressures on the Panda, including that of the spare tyre, which is a 'smaller' emergency-use tyre and is at much higher pressure. Then I cleared most of the weeds off the drive.</p>
