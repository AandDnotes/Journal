        <h1>Thursday 27th July</h1>
        <p>It rained all night and was drizzly for most of the morning. Since Angela was told that M&amp;S gluten-free items were good, we decided to go to Holmbush to do the weekly shop. We actually bought more other item than gluten-free items before going into Tesco. All this (including coffee) took most of the morning, however, our journey home was long, since the road from the Shoreham flyover was closed and we took a rather long route home. Unfortunately, a lot of people were coming in the opposite direction because of the road closure.</p>
        <p>After lunch I deleted the files on iCloud that had been uploaded by mistake. Then during the afternoon I swapped over the old and new iMacs, 'cleared' the old iMac and installed a new copy of the operating system. That leaves it ready to put into the box for Rowan. I had earlier retrieved a spare chair and the old iMac box from the loft and put up the new box.</p>
        <p>Angela had walked down to the High Street to get some ingredients for dinner, but then found other items missing, so we walked down again.</p>
