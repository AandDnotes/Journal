        <h1>Saturday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>It was a busy (and dry) morning, followed by a quiet (and wet) afternoon. We started with our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper, followed by a short read of same. Then I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the statement while Angela worked in the garden.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage and put the TC up on axle stands, ready to start a partial service. It was quite an effort, but I got it done before the rain came and before lunch.</p>
        <p>We had expected to talk with Victoria, but she wanted to talk tomorrow (today she is trying to get Austin ready for scout camp tomorrow). Paul posted some photos of their drive, of Rowan's 'corner' and of Rowan's room. So we asked if he wanted a chat today rather than tomorrow. So we did. We also asked if Rowan would like an upgrade to her iMac in her more sophisticated corner. The answer was yes.</p>
        <p>Consequently I ordered a new iMac, which will be delivered on Monday, and Paul can take our current iMac back with them (they are coming on Monday week).</p>
        <p>From lunchtime it rained for the rest of the day.</p>
