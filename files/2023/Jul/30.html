        <h1>Sunday 30th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I added suggested edits to the IET Sussex budget submission. Then I went into the garage, with the intent of putting some thread lock on the carburettor hold-up bolts. However, I found that, although the rear one is leaking a little, both bolts were secure and had not worked loose. So the spot of medium thread lock that I had applied earlier seems to have worked. I then turned my attention to the horn. I adjusted it so that the contacts were just closed. Then I tried applying 12 volts to it using my adapted PC power supply. As I should have realised, the horn takes too much current and to the PSU tripped as soon as I touched the terminal. I looked back at my previous work on the horn and discovered that I used cable from the TC's battery to provide power.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. It seems that Austin enjoyed his scout camp and completed all his badges. He though, though, he had spent enough time outside. Victoria and the children are travelling to Missouri on Wednesday. We then spoke with Paul. They are due to catch the 4:30 ferry from Calais, which should arrive in Dover at 5pm UK time. They may then stop to eat so as to miss the rush-hour on the M25.</p>
        <p>We extracted a single duvet from 'inside' the spare bed and made up the latter. Tomorrow I will rearrange the study and make up Rowan's bed. She is bringing her enormous dragon soft toy!</p>
