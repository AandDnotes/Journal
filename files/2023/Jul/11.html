        <h1>Tuesday 11th July</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going down to the High Street and to the church with her lunch club files. I started by going into the garage to work on the TC. I put a spot of thread lock on each of the carburettor hold-up bolts, checked the oil in the steering box and checked the tyre pressures.</p>
        <p>One of the Repair Cafe members called to pick up the PAT tester. I then spent some time this morning (and again this afternoon) taking apart the hedge cutter that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. The problem seems to be a micro-switch, but I can't find an exact replacement.</p>
