        <h1>Monday 31st July</h1>
        <p>It rained until the late afternoon and then was sunny, but still breezy. Paul et al arrived just after 9pm, having driven through rain al the way through Belgium and France.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her Monday morning meeting and I tried to get the TC's horn working, without success. After lunch we drove to Shoreham to buy a duvet for the spare bed, getting caught twice at the level crossing. At least we disposed of an old duvet. Then it was a case of converting the study into a bedroom for Rowan and making the spare bed. We had a little more time than expected before they arrived.</p>
