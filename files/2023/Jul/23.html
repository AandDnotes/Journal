        <h1>Sunday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>A dry day today, although our usual Sunday format. Angela went off to church while I (unsuccessfully) tried to find out who is on our IET Sussex email account. I then went into the garage to work on the TC. It took some time to clean out under the car and replace some of the cardboard. Then I greased the steering, front suspension and prop shaft. I also checked the play in the steering box. It seemed fine, so I didn't need to play with the shims. Then I checked the fluid levels in the front dampers before putting the wheels back on.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Austen had just gone off for his scout camp. Victoria is joining him on Thursday.</p>
        <p>During the evening we watched/listened to the PROMS performance of Beethoven's Ninth.</p>
