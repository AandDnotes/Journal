        <p>Angela went for an eye test this morning. She did not need any changes. Otherwise Angela worked in the garden and cooked.</p>
        <p>I checked that the Virgin ISAs were set up as expected. I also completed the Standard Life pension 'over 75 declaration' form and sent it off. Later I managed to get help from Virgin Media to log into our account. I now just need to see what is there.</p>
