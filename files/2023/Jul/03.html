        <h1>Monday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>Angela went to her exercise group this morning. I called Virgin and managed to change the easy access ISAs to one-year ISAs. However, the web site wouldn't show Angela's, so I must try again tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I then called the Brighton Apple store to arrange an appointment to look at the iMac. However, their automated answer system put me through to Apple Support. I thought the guy was American, but it turned out that he was Portugese and that the UK support was run out of Portugal. He thought it was a software problem and so we then spent over two hours working on fixing the slow running of the machine. He led me through various disk checks and then the deletion of a lot of unneeded files. He also suggested installing a malware check application. I had to restart the machine several times, initially in a basic mode. At the end it seemed to be running much better. I haven't cleared out files in Angela's account and the Apple support guy said that he (or one of his team) could lead me through a re-installation of the operating system.</p>
        <p>So we had a late lunch!</p>
        <p>I finished the draft of the web page for our trip to the US, but had problems updating the 'Trips' page; yet to be resolved.</p>
