        <h1>Thursday 20th July</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We went off to Waitrose to do the weekly shop (followed by coffee) and filled the Panda with fuel on the way back.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started the process of baking a dozen wholemeal rolls. While the dough was proving I contacted Apple support again and the woman led me through starting to re-install the OS. That only took half an hour, although the process took a couple of hours. For some reason, that version did not include the lates security update and so that took more time. In the end we have a newly installed and up-to-date OS, but it doesn't appear to be any faster!</p>
        <p>The rolls look good, so I put most in the freezer.</p>
