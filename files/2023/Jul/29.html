        <h1>Saturday 29th July</h1>
        <p>The days seem to be getting busier. We started by going to the High Street to buy a few things in addition to a newspaper. I then did the weekly accounts ( on the new iMac I didn't need to wait for Numbers to start up) while Angela went to a WI person to get a cheque signed. The it was into the garage for me. I got the plastic horn working (by wiring it into the correct terminal), but it appeared that the brake lights were not working. The windscreen wiper, fog lamp and brake lights are all on the same fuse. I checked the fuse, which was fine, and cleaned the fuse contact points. Everything then worked. Meanwhile, Angela washed the Panda.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela cut the grass and I dismantled the original horn. I tried to set the spacing based on the thickness of the shims that I am using. But I'm yet to test it.</p>
        <p>Angela did a lot of cooking, mainly gluten free cakes and biscuits. I made a new set of rolls, all while we cooked dinner.</p>
