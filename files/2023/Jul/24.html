        <h1>Monday 24th July</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. The window cleaner arrived while we were still in our dressing gowns. Angela went off to her Monday gathering and just before eleven the new iMac arrived. I just opened the box to peek inside. Then I walked down to the Health Centre to have a blood sample taken. I got home just before Angela.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage and finished greasing the TC. I can now take it off the axle stands, since the rest of the work needs to be done from the top.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I rearranged the study to try out an arrangement for Rowan to use it as a bedroom. That seemed to work. Then, having put it back as normal, I unpacked the new iMac and started it up. However, the startup (and later the migration assistant) could not find any other Macs from which to copy files. Changing the 'sharing' properties made it visible to the MacBook.</p>
