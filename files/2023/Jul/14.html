        <h1>Friday 14th July</h1>
        <p>I managed to work out how the parts of the micro-switch went together and came to the conclusion that one of the spring pins had broken off. So I worked out how much it would cost to buy a new switch (in a pack of three) and a pack of spade connectors. Later I spoke to the owner of the hedge trimmer, who agreed to buy the parts, so I ordered them.</p>
        <p>Angela did a lot of walking, failing to find some wholemeal self-raising flour, but then found some in the cupboard! She then spent the afternoon cooking, not just dinner, but biscuits and cakes. Meanwhile, I mainly read the paper.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we had some quite heavy rain and after dinner we watched the First Night of the Proms.</p>
