        <h1>Saturday 1st July</h1>
        <p>Angela was up and working in the garden before I was up. Even then, I almost went back to bed! However, we went down to the High Street to do what was essentially the bulk of our weekly groceries shop. Luckily we took the basket on wheels as well as several bags. I was quite a 'trudge' getting home.</p>
        <p>Angela then spent most of the day working in the garden. she cut all the lawns and did a lot of pruning and clearing. I, however, tackled the accounts. I did the weekly accounts (for three weeks) and followed up the fact that two ISAs had matured while we were away and we couldn't set the maturity option. So they were both put into an easy access ISA, at very low interest rate. I only got part way in the monthly update. So more to do tomorrow.</p>
