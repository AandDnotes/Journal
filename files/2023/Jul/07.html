        <h1>Friday 7th July</h1>
        <p>A very hot day, with clear blue skies from rise to set. Angela thought it too hot to go out anywhere (in the TC), so we pruned a couple of bushes</p>
        <p>I discovered that David F-B was planning to go on Wednesday's Wanderers run, so I contacted Ursula and ordered a meal (the only one I could remember). We will decide which car to take on the day.</p>
        <p>Finally I got around to starting work on the notes for the last PEI meeting, although I didn't get very far.</p>
