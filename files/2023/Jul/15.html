        <h1>Saturday 15th July</h1>
        <p>Not a particularly productive day. It was damp this morning, but became dry and breezy later. In fact, there was a weather warning for strong wind.</p>
        <p>We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some milk. Then we had dinner at lunch-time so that we could talk with Kate and Dick at six. Prior to that we spoke with Victoria. Whist talking with K&amp;D we booked a hotel in Bury St Edmunds in September. It looks as though I might need to run the next PEI meeting from the hotel.</p>
        <p>The micro-switches that I had ordered yesterday, arrived today.</p>
