        <h1>Sunday 16th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church as usual and I read the paper before picking her up outside the church and driving to Fran and David's at Lyminster for the WSMGOC barbecue. We got there before the food was served and we were lucky that it stayed dry and mainly sunny, if a little windy. We took the panda, but were able to view Harvey's TC and some other MGs.</p>
        <p>We were not the first to leave, but left before many others so that we could talk with Paul. They (or at least Greet) had just finished papering one of the walls in Rowan's bedroom. Yesterday Krista posted some photos of their drive, which should be finished by Tuesday.</p>
        <p>After talking with them we booked tickets for 'The Sound of Music', for the five of us.</p>
