        <h1>Friday 28th July</h1>
        <p>We thought that today was supposed to be the best day of the week, weather-wise. However, it started wet and drizzled on and off for most of the morning. Angela went to the butchers and then down to the church to help Sandie in the garden. I put the old iMac in its box and then went into the garage. I checked the gearbox oil level and the brake fluid level. Then I checked the lights (although I forgot about the brake lights). In the process I discovered that the horn had stopped working and the fog light did not work.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela planted out some lavender plants in the front and I investigated the problems with the TC. The fog lamp bulb is fine, so it might be the switch (which is difficult to get at on the dash). I removed the horn, stripped it down and cleaned the points. But it still didn't work. I tried refitting the plastic horn, but that I clearly wired it into the wrong place on the control box, since it simply turned on the ignition light!</p>
        <p>Later still I looked at the circuit diagrams and became very confused, since the wire colours are different, apart from the horn, but that seems to be wired into the wrong terminals on the control box!</p>
