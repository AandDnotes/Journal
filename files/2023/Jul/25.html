        <h1>Tuesday 25th July</h1>
        <p>Another busy day and a dry one. While Angela walked to the High Street to buy one or two things, I firstly investigated the Migration Assistant on the iMacs. I realised that you need to run it on both machines and so I set it going. It took about three hours. While that was working I went into the garage, adjusted the front brakes and then lowered the TC to the ground. It went more smoothly than I had expected.</p>
        <p>After lunch we drove to West Chiltington, to a nursery where Angela bought ten plants (plus another free one) to fill spaces in the gardens. When we got back I got things working on the new iMac, mostly needing to log into email accounts. However, I couldn't log into Angela's account. The password that the Migration Assistant had set would not work. Luckily I was able to reset her password from my account. Then I did an OS upgrade, which only took half an hour, before doing the same on the old iMac. It is still running!</p>
