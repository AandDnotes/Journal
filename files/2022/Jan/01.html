        <h1>Saturday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day. It was warm and bright, so we started with a walk. At least I 'started'; Angela had already put on some washing, done som vacuuming and hung out the washing.</p>
        <p>We really only wanted to go out to buy a newspaper, but we decided to go to the Beeding newsagents. We went up the twitten and down the Bostal, then took the direct route down Clays Hill and along The Street. We returned by going along the river bank and on to the Downs link, then across Clays Field and back up the Bostal. We were out for about one and a half hours.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I did the weekly accounts, needing to create a new spreadsheet for 2022. Later we had a two hour chat with Victoria. At least, she mainly talked to us.</p>
