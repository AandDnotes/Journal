        <h1>Wednesday 19th January</h1>
        <p>After sending off the live broadcast form for the talk on 1st March I spent the rest of the morning opening regular savings accounts with the Coventry Building Society. I also had to set up standing orders to fund it and then transfer money from each of our 'easy access' account to new one-year fixed-rate accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis as usual and I edited my January newsletter following comments from Greg. Then I added to my svg diagram of our house floor plan.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended an IET Surry talk on solid state batteries. The Chinese speaker had quite a difficult accent, so I left as the questions started.</p>
