        <h1>Sunday 30th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I took new photos of the dining room paintings and then took photos of the items on the walls of the sitting room. It took quite a long time to take the photos (without reflections), convert them to JPEG and then editing the 'sitting room' html file.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time tracking down what happens to a Teams invite when you click the 'Accept' button. They go into the Office 365 Outlook Calendar.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They'd had a quiet week.</p>
