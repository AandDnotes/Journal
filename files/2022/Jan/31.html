        <h1>Monday 31st January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to her exercise group and I had a Teams call with Norman to verify his documents for his DBS check. Then I took photos of other items (mainly glass ones) in the sitting room and added them to my 'gallery' site.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went off to deliver the posters that we had printed yesterday. She was out most of the afternoon, getting home just before my Eurotherm group Zoom meeting. Martin joined whilst on a walk; from the middle of Bramber, with it getting darker and darker.</p>
