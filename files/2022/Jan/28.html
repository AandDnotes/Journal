        <h1>Friday 28th January</h1>
        <p>The morning was about cleaning walking boots and preparing the MG for an outing. We left before midday and arrived at the World's End pub at Patching at about 12:20. We had the hood down, but kept to the main, and therefore smoother, roads. We had a good lunch and chat and arrived home at 3:30. The car ran well for the 25 miles of our trip.</p>
