        <h1>Thursday 6th January</h1>
        <p>We visited Dad after lunch, so beforehand I cut a piece of 12mm MDF to size for his chair. It was a very cold day and, in the garage, I couldn't feel my fingers. Luckily the board worked well and he was able to sit upright. However, his joggers were hanging in the wardrobe again! We also found a letter about his cataract operation, that must have been there for a few weeks.</p>
        <p>We went on to Waitrose to do our weekly groceries shop, finishing with a cup of tea.</p>
