        <h1>Wednesday 26th January</h1>
        <p>The window cleaners arrived before I was out of the bathroom this morning. So I then cleaned the inside of the sitting room and dining room windows. After that I put the MG's battery on charge and cleaned its windscreen. Whilst in the garage I also removed the foam from the cover of the cushion from Dad's chair. Surprisingly, the foam was in good condition, but Angela persuaded me not to wash the cover.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and I took photos of some of the paintings that were showing a lot of reflections. I put them on the floor and stood over them, replacing the images on the draft web site.</p>
