        <h1>Wednesday 5th January</h1>
        <p>We both had quite an active day. When I cam down after a shower, Angela had taken down most of the Christmas decorations. I took down some of the lights, but mainly packed everything away. Then, this morning I went for a walk and this afternoon Angela went to table tennis. It was a sunny, breezy and cold day, with the promise of a very frosty night. I took 50 minutes to walk around the lower horseshoe, getting back just before lunch. I walked faster than usual so as to get a bit more exercise.</p>
        <p>Angela took a lateral flow test before going out, so I registered it for her. On her return she made some vegetable soup. I emailed my speaker from the ESA and registered for four talks.</p>
