        <h1>Monday 10th January</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Angela went out at 10:15 to her exercise group and I left a few minutes later to walk to Bramber to join the the Eurotherm walking group. We walked to Henfield, had coffee and lunch at a cafe in a farmer's field. We walked eight miles in all, after I had already walked to Bramber. Luckily Martin gave me a lift home and I got home just before Angela.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela went to a WI committee meeting and after dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting at the Frankland Arms.</p>
