        <h1>Saturday 15th January</h1>
        <p>Not quite so cold, but cloudy. We did our usual walk to the High Street. We bought a newspaper and some cream. Then I did the weekly accounts, including the reconciliation against the statement.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a shorter than normal talk with Victoria. Their plumber wanted to know where to fit the pipes for the new shower, so she and Brandon had to go.</p>
        <p>I prepared some images for this month's newsletter and spent a little time researching responsive web sites, but made little progress.</p>
