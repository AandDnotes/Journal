        <h1>Saturday 8th January</h1>
        <p>It rained pretty much all day. As usual we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a couple of other things. Then, apart from reading the paper, I did the weekly accounts before lunch.</p>
        <p>It was later in the day before we spoke with Victoria. In fact we ended up continuing to talk over our dinner. They had snow in New Jersey. We finally stopped because the children wanted to go sledging. They had already been outside playing in the snow while we had been talking.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I spent some time 'playing' with my 'gallery' web site, with a little more success today.</p>
