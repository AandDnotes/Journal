        <h1>Sunday 9th January</h1>
        <p>A dryer day. Angela went to church and I paid Dad's paper bill. I also transferred Â£50 from Dad's account to our own for the things that we had bought and the cash that I had left with him.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we spoke with Paul et al. Then the evening was spent watching TV, continuously from 6.10 to 10:40!</p>
