        <h1>Monday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>This morning I set out to stick the fixing back on the number one by our front door. When removing the number the other fixing also came un-glued. So I cleaned it up, measured the position of the fixings and exoxy'd them on. I also emailed the supplier.</p>
        <p>Later I removed the outside light by the back gate and prepared one of the new LED lights for installation. But, by then it was too dark to fit it (and it was time for a cup of tea.)</p>
        <p>After that, I joined the Eurotherm group Zoom meeting.</p>
