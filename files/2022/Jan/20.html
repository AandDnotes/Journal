        <h1>Thursday 20th January</h1>
        <p>Tomorrow is the FLL Sussex heat and so I spent a good part of the morning reading the rulebook and watching the missions video. Meanwhile, Angela went to the butchers. Then I sent off two email about possible talks for the 2022/23 season.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we went off to Victoria Grand to see Dad. We took him a new cushion for his armchair. It was too high with both cushions, so we brought the original one back with us. We also spent time looking through some of his old photos and then put the box with all the photo packets in his wardrobe.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Waitrose for a cup of tea and to do the week's grocery shopping.</p>
