        <h1>Monday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Another calm day with sunshine from dawn to dusk, even though the temperature didn't get above seven degrees. Angela went to her exercise group and I completed the draft of the January newsletter, which I sent to Greg for review. I also corresponded with a speaker for a later talk.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting. They had a speaker from the Wiston winery, including some samples. I took the TC for a run, the first of the year. I only did 17 miles; up through Ashurst to Partridge Green and back down through Henfield. It took a while for the engine to warm up (there is no thermostat), but it ran well. Then I experimented with creating a blog page on to give access to the talk recordings.</p>
