        <h1>Tuesday 25th January</h1>
        <p>I had a short word with Dad (we were cut off, or perhaps Dad inadvertently pressed a button) and then I booked a visit. We decided to have an early lunch and then go shopping in Worthing.</p>
        <p>We parked on the front, just passed Heene Road and walked back into Worthing centre. Our first stop was in Millets, where I bought a new pair of walking shoes. Then Angela bought some seeds and a bird feeder, while I bought Dad some more (six packs) Werthers Originals. We then had a cup of tea in M&amp;S before walking back to the car and home.</p>
