        <h1>Friday 7th January</h1>
        <p>Another cold, bright morning. While Angela went to the butchers, I spoke with Alan and then phoned West Sussex NHS Trust to see if Dad's xxx operation could be moved to Goring Hall. However, it seems that the trust cannot outsource to Goring Hall. So I phoned SpaMedica at Sayers Common to get them to correspond with me. In fact I was able to make him an appointment for an assessment in early February.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I found what bubble wrap we had, put it in a plastic bag and fixed it to the inside of the loft hatch with bungy ropes. Later I found a bigger bag and added some more bubble wrap. I also started experimenting with my 'gallery' web site. It did not go well.</p>
