        <h1>Friday 21st January</h1>
        <p>The alarm clock sounded at seven this morning and I was up to prepare breakfast. Just before nine I joined the FLL team in preparation for the morning's contest. Finally there were only two teams, so we had an easier time than expected. I was referee for the robot challenge (as in previous years) and so could listen to their presentations before having to do anything. We had a couple of breaks, including one for lunch, and finished by 1:30.</p>
        <p>Angela went to to a meeting and I had a quiet afternoon, feeling quite tired after a disturbed night. I added a little to my 'gallery' web site, but otherwise only read the paper.</p>
