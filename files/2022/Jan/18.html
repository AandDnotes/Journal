        <h1>Tuesday 18th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off on the bus to Storrington this morning to bank her WI cash. I dealt with a few email and then completed the blog post with links to recorded talks. I sent a list of difficulties to the EngX support team along with a request for them to modify our home page.</p>
        <p>Later I took photos of the remaining pieces of art in the hall and added them to my experimental 'gallery' web site. I started adding notes about the items.</p>
        <p>After dinner I 'went' to the first events sub-committee meeting.</p>
