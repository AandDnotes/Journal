        <h1>Tuesday 4th January</h1>
        <p>The day started dry and about 9 degrees, so after talking with Dad I went outside to continue putting up the new outside lights. I was able to prepare the second light in the garage during the first shower, but the second turned into persistent rain and the temperature was down to five degrees. Nevertheless I finished installing two lights, making three in all.</p>
        <p>So after lunch I relaxed and did a little more research on LED headlights for the TC. I emailed the result to Peter Cole, who is looking for direct replacements for the original bulbs.</p>
