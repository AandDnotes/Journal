        <h1>Sunday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the monthly accounts and then went in the garden to try to get the garden store doors open. I ended up taking off one of the doors, planing off one side and moving the hinges. I took longer than I'd expected, so we missed the lunchtime news.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul (Rowan was playing an online game with a friend) and then spent the evening watching TV.</p>
