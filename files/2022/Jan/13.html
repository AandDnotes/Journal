        <h1>Thursday 13th January</h1>
        <p>A cold, frosty start that developed into a bright, sunny and calm day. However, it was quite busy; at least the afternoon was.</p>
        <p>The morning was mainly about tidying up a few things and checking the cars over. After an early lunch we went to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop and then went on to visit Dad. It took quite a while to get through the testing process.</p>
        <p>We were home in time to make a cup of tea before I joined a Sussex STEM meeting about the FLL day next week. Then dinner and an IET talk on graphene.</p>
