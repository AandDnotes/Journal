        <h1>Monday 24th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went to her 'exercise' group and then to a service for Phylis' mother, followed by a wake. She left at around ten and did not get home until four o'clock. Shiela was with her and came in for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>I transferred money from one of Dad's savings accounts to his current account and did some preparation for the evening's committee meeting. I also did a little more to my 'gallery' site. After dinner we had our Sussex Network committee meeting. I was pleased to see that Steve, Mark and Kossidina all attended and the latter is still keen to take over the Secretary's job from Norman.</p>
