        <h1>Saturday 29th January</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, doing odds and ends, following our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. It was warmer than it has been, with occasional sunny spells, in spite of having rained over night.</p>
        <p>Being Saturday, I did the weekly accounts and then watched a video on YouTube about a young man in California collecting a TC for restoration. We had expected to talk to Victoria later, since Juniper was going to gymnastics. But snow had caused it to be cancelled. So we talked with them while they were eating their breakfast, of sorts.</p>
        <p>Norman Wong had asked me to verify his identity for his application to become a STEM Ambassador. So I responded to the email, but need to view his documents. Teams insisted on wanting an update, so I asked him to organise a meeting. I also fixed a new bird table/feeder to the wall in the walled garden.</p>
