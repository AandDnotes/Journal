        <h1>Friday 14th January</h1>
        <p>Another sunny, calm, but cold day. The frost didn't leave areas that did not get any sun, even though the temperature reached a few degrees.</p>
        <p>Although Angela delivered her draft WI programme leaflet for review and later went to the library, I didn't venture out. I had intended taking the TC out for a run, but the sun set earlier than I had expected, or perhaps I just delayed going until it was too late. So the car battery is still connected up to the trickle charger.</p>
        <p>I modified Dad's SpaMedica form and spent some time emailing and reading the FLL rule book. Otherwise it was a case of trying to progress my 'gallery' web site. For some reason I couldn't get FileZilla (an ftp application) to connect to the Raspberry pi, so I used the vnc program. I tired opening the ftp port on the firewall and even disabled the firewall, but to no avail. I left the firewall off and disabled the port forwarding in the router. The site looks a mess on my phone, so I will have to think again.</p>
