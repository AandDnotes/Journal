        <h1>Wednesday 12th January</h1>
        <p>It was a dry, sunny, calm day and was quite a momentous day today. I had my first professional haircut for about two years. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I went to JB&Co's by the zebra crossing. I had to book an appointment, but it only cost Â£10, even though it is a bit shorter than I really wanted.</p>
        <p>The talk that I was planning to attend this evening was cancelled. So I 'played' a little with my gallery web site. I also found the FLL rulebook and read it.</p>
