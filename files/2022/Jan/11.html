        <h1>Tuesday 11th January</h1>
        <p>I didn't sleep very well and today was a busy day. Angela went to the High Street and I did a little more research on 'responsive' web sites. I also made an appointment to visit Dad on Thursday and had a quick chat with him.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drove to Field Place to an RCEA talk. It was given by Ian Currie, who occasionally talks on Radio Sussex about the weather. He was terrible.</p>
        <p>Luckily, the IET talk in the evening was much better, although I had to quickly make a start slide. I had told Mike Underhill that I would prepare one, but forgot. I also made a CPD certificate.</p>
