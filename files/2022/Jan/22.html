        <h1>Saturday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>A grey and chilly, but calm and dry day. Being Saturday we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper, along with some spinach and rolls. Then it was the usual reading of the paper and doing the weekly accounts. I also had a number of Coventry Building Society letters to file away, having set up new regular savings accounts and moved money around.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Austin, Juniper and Victoria. The former two in a somewhat sporadic fashion and then the usual mainly monologue from Victoria. It was -10 degrees Celcius in Berkleigh Heights and progress on their bathrooms had been slow. Builders were sitting in their van waiting for plasterboard to be delivered.</p>
        <p>We managed to finish just in time to put on shoes and go to Felicity and John's for a cup of tea. We had a pleasant couple of hours chatting with them. Although their house is essentially the same as ours, being a mirror image makes it feel quite different.</p>
