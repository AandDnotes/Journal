        <h1>Sunday 16th January</h1>
        <p>A very sedentary day, at least for me. Angela walked to church, but I stayed inside all day. While Angela was out I started putting my January newsletter together. Then later worked on my 'gallery' web site. I worked out how to get an ftp connection to the Raspberry pi and checked that the 'responsive' site worked on the iPad and iPhone.</p>
        <p>Angela 'cooked' the marmalade, making nine jars, which hopefully will last us until next year. As usual we spoke with Paul. It didn't take very long, since they hadn't done a lot and nor had we.</p>
