        <h1>Friday 18th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early(ish) to help set up for the Christmas Bazaar. Apart from hanging out the washing, I spent the morning (and part of the afternoon) sending IET-related email.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried once again to mirror the MacBook screen on the TV. I spent quite some time 'chatting' with Apple support. I spoke to two different people and they both kept switching from one thing to another. The first asked me to delete certain files, which did not exist. The second said that my operating system was a beta release! Finally she asked if I had run the diagnostics, so I ended the chat and ran them. It ran, but didn't give me any results, so I now need to contact them again to see if anything showed up.</p>
        <p>Angela spent the afternoon cooking for the Bazaar, both for the lunch desert and for the cake stall.</p>
