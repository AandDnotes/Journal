        <h1>Monday 21st November</h1>
        <p>A lot of the day seems to have been spent doing IET related work, mainly email. Then, after dinner I joined the IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her exercise group in the morning and to her WI meeting in the afternoon. After lunch I had a call from an Apple support person, looking at my problem with mirroring the MacBook's screen. It still didn't work so he suggested that I check with the port adapter manufacturer, but also made me an appointment at the Brighton shop. However, when looking for the order of the adapter I discovered that I had bought a USB-C to HDMI cable. When I used this, either directly into the MacBook or through the adapter, it worked! So the HDMI port on the adapter is broken. I mailed Mokin to see what they can do, even though I bought a little over two years ago.</p>
