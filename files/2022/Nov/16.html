        <h1>Wednesday 16th November</h1>
        <p>Another rainy day. Angela went down to the High Street, and got wet. I emailed people about yesterday's talk. Then, just before lunch I had a telephone call from someone who claimed to be from BT Openreach and said that other people were using our broadband router. He knew that we were with Virgin but didn't know my email address. He emailed me, but the address did not look convincing. I sent the email to the Virgin scam unit.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Worthing hospital to be fitted with a heart monitor. I need to return it tomorrow. Later I tried to get the MacBook's display to mirror on the TV, with no success.</p>
