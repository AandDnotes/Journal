        <h1>Tuesday 8th November</h1>
        <p>It was dry enough this morning for Angela put the washing out on the line. We brought it in just as I was leaving for the RCEA talk. Angela walked down to the High Street to buy a few groceries.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela did quite a bit of cooking and I went to the RCEA talk. It was not very good. I got home just before five, having stopped for fuel.</p>
