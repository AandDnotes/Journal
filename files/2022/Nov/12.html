        <h1>Saturday 12th November</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. This week we didn't need anything else. However, later in the afternoon Angela had to drive to Holmbush to buy food for Monday's lunch club. She discovered this morning that the 'cook' for Monday was ill and had not bought anything. So she agreed to do more than the washing up.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had our usual chat with Victoria. Otherwise, I updated the operating system on the iMac and then did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation with the bank statement.</p>
