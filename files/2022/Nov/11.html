        <h1>Friday 11th November</h1>
        <p>Armistice Day. We were actually in a shop at 11am, so missed the two minutes silence.</p>
        <p>This morning we drove to the Horsham Park &amp; Ride site and caught a bus into the town centre. We then spent most of the day buying bits and pieces, arriving home at four o'clock. Luckily it was dry and quite mild.</p>
        <p>Before we left I replied to Daniel Eastwood about Tuesday's talk. Then just before dinner I had a conversation with Deshi about the talk.</p>
