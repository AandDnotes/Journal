        <h1>Friday 25th November</h1>
        <p>Today was mainly about catching up. We started by going off to do our weekly shop, which we had not been able to do yesterday, our normal day of the week for grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>So we went to Lyons Farm and were home for coffee0. This meant that Angela had time to go to the High Street to find some nuts for her 'chewy bar'. But she had to walk to Beeding later to find some.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I cleaned the tops of the gutter downpipes, mainly removing sycamore seeds. Then I cut a piece of sapele wood (from the floor that we laid in Highfield road) and glued them together to form a thicker piece.</p>
