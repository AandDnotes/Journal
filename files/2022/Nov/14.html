        <h1>Monday 14th November</h1>
        <p>Angela was out early this morning to set up for the lunch club. I went down for lunch and then helped clear up. I had seconds of both the main course and the desert! Angela was then out in the afternoon for a 'safeguarding' course. She didn't get back until about eight. I had gone to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington well before then. I won a raffle prize (a tin of shortbread).</p>
        <p>I had an email from our December speaker to say that he couldn't do it!</p>
