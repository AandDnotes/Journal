        <h1>Tuesday 1st November</h1>
        <p>My day started with a trip to Shoreham airport to the Eurotherm retirees breakfast meeting. I only bought a parking ticket for one hour and so had to leave earlier than the rest. Also, I was the only one who didn't eat anything.</p>
        <p>I spent quite a lot of time dealing with IET event related issues, including an update on event advertising. We had our main meal at lunchtime since I went to an IET talk in Crawley in the early evening. Although we didn't have permission to record the talk, we did a couple of test recordings. The sound did not seem very loud, but Ramon took the camera to look at the clips on a PC.</p>
        <p>It was a very interesting talk about using hydrogen powered unmanned planes to provide 4G, 5G and 6G communications and broadband.</p>
