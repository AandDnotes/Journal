        <h1>Wednesday 9th November</h1>
        <p>Sunny from dawn to dusk; breezy at times, but mild. Martin picked me up in his MGB Roadster just before ten and we drove up to Warnham, to the north west of Horsham, to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee we set off to a pub near Loxwood. Unfortunately there were three road closures on the way! So the journey took us a little longer than expected. After a good lunch we took the direct route back, arriving home at a quarter to four. The hood was down all the way.</p>
        <p>Angela had been to table tennis after lunch. After dinner I emailed Danial Eastwood about the talk next Tuesday.</p>
