        <h1>Monday 7th November</h1>
        <p>The scheduled Eurotherm walk was postponed due to the wet weather, so I had a day at home. It rained for a lot of the day, so that wasn't too much of a handicap. Angela went to her exercise group this morning and go wet on the way home, although did manage to spend an hour in the garden, until it started raining!</p>
        <p>I did simple things such as print the route instructions for Wednesday's Wanderers outing. I also 'massaged' the RCEA Christmas Lunch form, completed it with our choices of dishes and printed it, putting it in an envelope with a cheque. I can't remember the last time I wrote a cheque.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was reading email and the newspaper, although I did refine my article on carburettor tuning.</p>
