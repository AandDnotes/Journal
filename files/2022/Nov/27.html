        <h1>Sunday 27th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I spent some time in the garage shaping the handle part of the dibber that I am trying to make. I left the handle and the spike with a sliver of wood glued into the groove that was left because I glued the planks together in the wrong order. I'm hoping that this will make it look a little better.</p>
        <p>I also drafted the template for my Christmas letters. I now need to see what people said in last year's cards/letters and adapt the template to each recipient.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the 'tree of trees' tree planting ceremony at Fletchers Croft. It was a little soggy! Then we spoke with Victoria (for only an hour) and a little later with Paul. They had been to Greet and Wim's for the second day in a row, since it was Wim's 74th birthday.</p>
