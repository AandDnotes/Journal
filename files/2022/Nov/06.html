        <h1>Sunday 6th November</h1>
        <p>It rained for most of the day and Angela got quite wet coming home from church. While she was out I updated my events programme blog page and pdf file. I also replied to Ramon about his YouTube advert for upcoming talks.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. Otherwise there was a lot of reading, of the newspaper and of TTT2.</p>
