        <h1>Wednesday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>After I dealt with some email and Angela looked through the Kingsmead deed documents, I walked to Kingsmead close and put the package of documents through the letterbox of number five.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I wrote a summary of the last IET talk given at Falmer. Then I sent it to Steve for his newsletter. I had previously asked Greg to do the same for yesterday's talk.</p>
