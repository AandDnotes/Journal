        <h1>Monday 28th November</h1>
        <p>There were more showers today than the forecast seemed to suggest, but Angela managed to stay mainly dry. She went to her exercise group this morning and then into the High Street. I managed to get an hour in the garage to plane the body of my 'dibber' to it's starting shape. The slivers glued into the grooves improved matters a little. I marked the 'spike' ready for planing it to a point, but that is the job for the next hour that I can sneak into the garage.</p>
        <p>I cleared some of my IET actions, but still have one to do. JH sent me a speaker certificate and I spent some time trying to work out why Preview changed the text justification on some (but not all) of the form fields. I ended up installing Adobe Acrobat Reader on the iMac.</p>
