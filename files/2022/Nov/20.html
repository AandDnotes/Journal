        <h1>Sunday 20th November</h1>
        <p>Another dry, if chilly day. It seemed quite a busy day, even though little was pre-arranged.</p>
        <p>While Angela was a church I transferred Â£5K from our current account into the new (after maturity) Invesco one-year bond. I also downloaded the latest mbna statement and updated our weekly accounts spreadsheet. Then I spent another hour 'chatting' to an Apple support person about the problem mirroring the screen on the MacBook. Someone will phone me tomorrow afternoon.</p>
        <p>After lunch. we walked down to the church to put some WD40 on a lock on the rear door. I think it might just be wearing out. A little later we spoke with Victoria (she and Austin had been to a scout camp yesterday). They are thinking of driving up to Missouri for Christmas. Afterwards we spoke to Paul.</p>
