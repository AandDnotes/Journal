        <h1>Tuesday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>An exhausting day, although maybe only for me. Angela went off first to catch the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash. I left a little later to meet up with the Eurotherm walking group in Bramber. We walked to Henfield and back (about nine miles). I left them at the Bramber roundabout and walked up Clays Hill. By the time I got home I was very sweaty and worn out.</p>
        <p>So that was most of the day. When I got home I dealt with a lot of new email and then had a shower. All my clothes were wet with sweat.</p>
