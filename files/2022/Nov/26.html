        <h1>Saturday 26th November</h1>
        <p>It was almost a normal Saturday, and it was dry. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and Angela went straight into the garden to clear leaves.</p>
        <p>A little later I went into the garage to check the tyre pressures and start tidying up the wood that I had glued together. I realised that I could have improved what I had done by gluing them together in a different order.</p>
        <p>We had intended speaking to Victoria as usual, but they went out in 'their' morning. Later, they were still out, so we postponed our chat until tomorrow afternoon.</p>
        <p>I had another email from MOKiM, saying that they will 'apply' for a replacement hub. So I supplied my address. We will see what happens.</p>
