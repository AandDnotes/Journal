        <h1>Saturday 19th November</h1>
        <p>Most of the day was about the the Christmas Bazaar. While Angela went off to help prepare the lunches I did the weekly accounts. Then I went to the High Street to get a newspaper before going to the Bazaar. I then spent the morning (through to two o'clock) selling lunch tickets. After a slow start I sold 40 lunches, plus a collection of puddings.</p>
        <p>After we had our lunch we finished clearing up and I went home. Angela followed a little later. We sat for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
