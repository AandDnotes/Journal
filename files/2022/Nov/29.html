        <h1>Tuesday 29th November</h1>
        <p>The main job of both of us today was to start our Christmas letters. Angela wrote hers by hand, whereas I adapted the template for each of the recipients and then printed them off. So Angela ended the day with some letters, in cards, in envelopes and I have a set of letters waiting to go in cards.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was a case of dealing with email, although I spent quite a lot of time trying to work out how to add Mark Cunningham to our IET Sussex Twitter and LinkedIn accounts in an admin role. He will then be able to do our posts.</p>
