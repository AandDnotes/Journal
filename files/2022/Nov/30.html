        <h1>Wednesday 30th November</h1>
        <p>Today was the day for a reminder email to be sent to the Sussex IET members about next week's talk and to post reminders on Twitter and LinkedIn. The email had already been scheduled, but I did the other two posts. Then I emailed Mark to ask him to send me his Twitter name and for him to join our LinkedIn group.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I spent an hour in the garage. I planed the point of my dibber. So now there is just the most difficult part to do, the mortice and tenon to join the handle to the spike. I will probably need to wait until Sunday morning to start this. Should I put the spike in the middle of the handle or towards one end?</p>
        <p>I then just had time to write my Christmas cards (inserting my letters) before cup of tea time. But the postmen are on strike today and tomorrow!</p>
