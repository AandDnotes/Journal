        <h1>Thursday 17th November</h1>
        <p>Today I spent some time looking at the training/reading/rules for the First Lego League. I still need to read the Challenge rules in more detail.</p>
        <p>After lunch we drove into Worthing, to Waitrose. Angela went in to start the weekly shop and I walked to the hospital to deliver my heart monitor. I had woken twice during the night, but only on the first occasion did I feel any change in heart-rate. I had to press one of the buttons on the recorder and make a note of the time, what I was doing and what symptoms I experienced. I removed the pads and recorder before leaving home.</p>
        <p>Having delivered the recorder I walked back to Waitrose to help finish the shop. We then went to Range to look for 'horse' design cushions. They had lots of cushions, but none with horses.</p>
