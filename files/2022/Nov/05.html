        <h1>Saturday 5th November</h1>
        <p>I don't think that it stopped raining all day and well into the evening. So our walk to the High Street was under umbrellas.</p>
        <p>We went to the market to buy some apples then to the Coop and then on to the Steyning Centre to view the art exhibition and raft show. Rather than have coffee there we went to the Penfold Hall where the Museum volunteers were having a coffee morning. We ended up being there from 10:30 till midday. We didn't win any of the raffle prizes.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did the weekly accounts and Angela did a lot of cooking. Then, after dinner, we spoke with Victoria.</p>
