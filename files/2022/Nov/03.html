        <h1>Thursday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>I started the day by tackling the monthly accounts. This took a while since Royal Mail had been renamed and I found an error in my 'analysis' sheet of the weekly accounts spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Later I created an Adestra email for the next talk and sent a test to myself for review. I also sent Steve a STEM photo that Mike W had sent me.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took Angela into Worthing. I parked in Waitrose, Angela walked to the hospital for an ENT appointment and I did the weekly shop (after having a cup of tea). Angela was not long and found me in Waitrose before I had finished the shop.</p>
