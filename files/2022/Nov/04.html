        <h1>Friday 4th November</h1>
        <p>For a change it was sunny, although breezy and not very warm. After submitting my event email (making a mistake, correcting it and re-submitting) I cleared out the gutters. They had overflowed in at leas one place the day before.</p>
        <p>Immediately after lunch it was a walk down to the dentist for a checkup. She removed a little tartar and then found a small cavity, so filled it and charged me Â£65! It seems that even a small filling (which one took a minute to drill and fill) comes into the second band.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I went to the SRFC meeting. It was at Worthing Leisure Centre, but the road had been closed near Wiston due to an accident and another accident had occurred on the A27 at Shoreham. So I went over the Bostal, on to Broadwater and then past Field Place. It was a very good talk by Derek Woodley on flying Concord from Heathrow to JFK. On the way home I found that the A27 had been closed at Lyons Farm, so I went the long way round, via Brooklands, to get home. I did not get home until 10:15.</p>
