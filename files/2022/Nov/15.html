        <h1>Tuesday 15th November</h1>
        <p>I spent part of the morning downloading, editing and printing an attendance list for the evening talk. Then we (Daniel Eastwood and I) forgot to get people to tick the boxes!</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunchtime since I was going out in the evening (and there would be some food). Then Angela went to a WI committee meeting. I also spent a long time on the phone trying to get the Government Gateway to identify me. The response was of no help. Having failed to use my passport and driving licence I tried the other option, which only required selecting a few options, Which, together with my passport details satisfied the system.</p>
        <p>It rained most of the day and, although it had stopped raining when I drove to Falmer, there was a lot of spray. We had 42 attendees. It took a while to find the food, which was quite a way from the lecture theatre. It was a good talk.</p>
