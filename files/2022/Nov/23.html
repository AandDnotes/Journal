        <h1>Wednesday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>A less energetic day, at least for me. I discovered that the cream for my scalp, as suggested by the dermatologist at Southlands Hospital, had been prescribed and was waiting at the pharmacist. So I walked down to the health centre and then popped into the Coop. It was a more gentle walk after yesterday's trek.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I put together the MacBook connected to the TV and took a couple of photos to send to MOKiM about the failed HDMI port on the adapter.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and I produced the reminder Adestra email for the upcoming talk at the Hawth.</p>
