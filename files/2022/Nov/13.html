        <h1>Sunday 13th November</h1>
        <p>Remembrance Sunday. Angela went off to church and I spent a lot of the morning dealing with IET related things. I created a start slide for Tuesday, along with some notices that I can stick up to direct people to the food and to the talk. Otherwise, I updated the OS on the MacBook and read yesterday's paper.</p>
        <p>Angela spent the afternoon in the garden, mainly picking up leaves. I disassembled the down-pipe by the water butts, but found it clear. So I lowered the diverter about 5mm. Afterwards we spoke with Paul before dinner.</p>
