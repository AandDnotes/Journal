        <h1>Thursday 10th November</h1>
        <p>We started our usual weekly shop by going to Lidl, before going on to M&S for coffee (and where Angela bout a sweater) and to Tesco to do the rest of the groceries shop (and where I bought some pants). This all took some time and so it was late by the time we got home for lunch.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela cleared up leaves and I cut the grass. Later still Alan phoned about coming down around the time of Dad's birthday.</p>
