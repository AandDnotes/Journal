        <h1>Thursday 24th November</h1>
        <p>It is Independence Day for Victoria et al. For us it was all about having lunch out to celebrate (a few days late) Dad's birthday. Chris and Alan arrived at about 11:30 after an uneventful drive from home. We went off to the Fish Factory in very blustery conditions where we had a good (if somewhat large) meal. It started raining just as we got back to the car. We were too full to do anything else this afternoon.</p>
