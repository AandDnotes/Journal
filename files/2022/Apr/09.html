        <h1>Saturday 9th April</h1>
        <p>We walked down to the High Street a little later than usual so that we could then go into the Methodist church for the St Barnabas coffee morning. So it was 11:30 by the time we got home. I then went into the garage and cleaned and checked the plugs in the TC and adjusted the points.</p>
        <p>After lunch I refitted the plugs and took the car for a run up to Henfield, through Partridge Green and back down through Ashurst. I stopped on the way out to get some petrol, since the low-petrol light was starting to come on. The car ran well. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden and then I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria.</p>
