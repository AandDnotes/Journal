        <h1>Friday 8th April</h1>
        <p>I did not sleep well last night. For some reason it took a very long time to get to sleep and then I woke early.</p>
        <p>Most of my time today was spent doing things associated with our attempt to hold a hybrid meeting. I emailed the chair of the Sussex Network about their approach and, after lunch, had a Teams chat with Greg on the subject. We agreed on an approach and put in motion the purchase of a video camera. But we have to get approval from the CC-UK.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the audiologist at the health centre to get her hearing aids adjusted. Then I took a short (20 minute) walk, between showers.</p>
