        <h1>Wednesday 6th April</h1>
        <p>A wet and very windy day. Angela had a dentist appointment for a checkup just after midday and got a bit wet. I spent a lot of time during the day trying to get a video connection between the HP laptop and the MacBook Air and the Nikon camera and the MacBook.</p>
        <p>In the end I decided that I need a video capture device to go between the PC or the camera and the MacBook. Even then, I don't know if the camera will act as a webcam. So I ordered a device from Amazon. One that was reported as being the best device.</p>
