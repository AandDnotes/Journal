        <h1>Sunday 24th April</h1>
        <p>Drive It Day! And a splendid day. It was sunny all day and reasonably warm. We left home in the TC  at about ten, stopping at the Beeding service station on the way to Michelham Priory. We took the A27, both because it was the shortest route and the smoother route.</p>
        <p>We arrived just after eleven, finding another couple in the visitor's car park. The man in the gatehouse didn't know where we should go, but then, having driven through the gatehouse arch, we found ten MGs on the South Lawn. A few more arrived a little later.</p>
        <p>We toured the house, had lunch in the cafe, then walked around and the grounds and gardens before sitting with other club members in the sunshine. We left at about 3:15 and took the same route home, doing a total of 62 miles.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Paul and then Victoria before dinner.</p>
