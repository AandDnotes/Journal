        <h1>Monday 11th April</h1>
        <p>This morning I completed the edits to Tuesday's recorded talk. Angela went off to help at the lunch club later in the morning. I went off at 12:30 to have my lunch there, sitting and talking with Gordon. I helped clear the tables afterwards.</p>
        <p>After tea I went off to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington.</p>
