        <h1>Thursday 7th April</h1>
        <p>As usual on Thursday, we went off to do the weekly supermarket shop. Usually we would go on to visit Dad, but visits have been suspended while they have a positive Covid case in the home.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I sent a few email, downloaded the recording of Tuesday's talk and edited it. I need to wait for Mike's start slide and then paste that into the start while he is doing the welcome and introduction.</p>
        <p>We had another go at producing a mandate for Angela's WI bank account to change one of the signatories. I also established why my HDMI to USB-C cable does not work (the USB-C end needs to be the source) and added a little to my 'stories' draft web page.</p>
