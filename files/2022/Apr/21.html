        <h1>Thursday 21st April</h1>
        <p>We started a little earlier than usual to go to Lyons Farm to do the weekly groceries shop. This gave us time to move on to Waitrose for coffee (and to buy some sweets) before going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went out for a while and I put wax under the wings. Then I cleaned the wheels and refitted them before lowering the car to the ground. I checked the tyre pressures so that the car is fit to go on the run on Sunday.</p>
        <p>After dinner I completed the draft of my newsletter.</p>
