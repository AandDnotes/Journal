        <h1>Friday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>I started by giving my draft newsletter a review and then got the system to send a test copy to Greg for review. We then walked down to the High Street to go to the bookshop. We noted a 'dragon' novel for Rowan and ordered another 'dragon' story.</p>
        <p>Angela pottered in the garden and I 'washed' the TC, which is really wiping it over with a damp cloth. After lunch I put some wax on the paintwork and chrome. I also put some antique wax on the dashboard and leather/rexine.</p>
