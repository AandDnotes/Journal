        <h1>Sunday 17th April</h1>
        <p>Apart from making a birthday card for Angela, while she was at church, I spent most of the day in the garage. I checked the brake fluid and topped up the gearbox oil. The checked the rear dampers (topping up the off-side one) and topped up the differential oil. During the afternoon Angela pottered in the garden.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
