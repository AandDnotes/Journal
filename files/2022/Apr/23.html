        <h1>Saturday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>Much as expected, we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. I then did the weekly accounts and Angela did some vacuuming. I also tested my video capture device with Windows. The video worked well, but I couldn't get the sound to come through.</p>
        <p>I discovered that the video of this week's talk had been put on our OneDrive and so I downloaded it, edited out the unwanted bits, including the end, where the speakers sound was mainly interference. Then, as usual, it was necessary to run the file through Handbrake so as to reduce its inflated size produced by iMovie.</p>
        <p>During the day I put the TC's battery on charge. It didn't take long, so it was probably fairly well charged.</p>
