        <h1>Monday 18th April</h1>
        <p>Easter Monday, a bank holiday in the UK and a fine day with hazy sunshine.</p>
        <p>During the day I checked, dusted and adjusted the front brakes on the TC. I also oiled the various linkages and removed the rear wheels in preparation for checking the brakes.</p>
        <p>After lunch we decided to go for a short walk. However, we went a little further than planned, which took us just over one and a half hours.</p>
        <p>Angela found the child seat and booster seat so that we could check that they are suitable for Austin and Juniper.</p>
