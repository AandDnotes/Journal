        <h1>Sunday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>Another cold day, but with a little sunshine. While Angela went to church I updated the IET Sussex event programme 'booklet', updated the old laptop and backed up the usual files and finished my 'data assets' web page. Actually some of these things were spread over the day, including updating apps on the iPad.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday we spoke with Paul. Rowan had been to a 'swimming' birthday party and so was quite tired and still a little wet.</p>
