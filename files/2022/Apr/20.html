        <h1>Wednesday 20th April</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going walking with the WI group, while I started drafting this month's newsletter and then went into the garage to start cleaning the underside of the TC.</p>
        <p>Just after Angela got home, someone delivered some flowers from Paul and Krista.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was somewhat similar. No more flowers, but she went out to do various things and I finished cleaning the underside of the wings and the chassis</p>
