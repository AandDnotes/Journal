        <h1>Friday 1st April</h1>
        <p>We had no April fools today, but it was cold, windy, with a bit of sunshine and a snow storm. Unusually I drove down to the health centre at midday (Angela went to the library and was caught in a snow storm) to have an ECG. My racing heart rate was bad last night, so I phoned early to make an appointment. It was decided to ask the cardiac unit to set me up with a monitor to record 24 hour activity for seven days. They (Sonya and Dr H) decided to increase the dosage of bisophrolol and so changed my prescription, which was waiting for me to collect. Angela went down later to collect it.</p>
        <p>A blood sample was also taken and I received an email in the evening with a link to the results. It seems that my cholesterol is a bit high.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, feeling tired, I did a lot of sitting down.</p>
