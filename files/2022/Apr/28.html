        <h1>Thursday 28th April</h1>
        <p>A busier day. We started with a trip to Lyons Farm. Angela started the grocery shop while I firstly went to B&amp;Q to buy a water butt diverter kit and then back to Sainsbury's to get â‚¬300. We didn't have time for coffee (the Sainsbury's cafe has now closed), so went straight on to Victoria Grand to visit Dad.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went down to the High Street and then did a lot of cooking. I moved the small water butt from the walled garden into the front garden. I used another slab from the old patio, but have yet to fit the diverter.</p>
