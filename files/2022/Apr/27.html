        <h1>Wednesday 27th April</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela was very busy. She left the house at 8:15 to walk to the High Street to get her hair cut. She got home just in time to go off with Felicity for the WI walking group, getting home just in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>I dealt with a number of IET email and tried to sort out my expanding inbox. Later in the day we had a call from Lester. He will call on Sunday to talk about the increased cost of materials and will then start on Tuesday 10th May, the day after our return from the Netherlands. So I will need to move the water butt this week.</p>
        <p>I also measured the steps outside the front door and sketched the changes we want.</p>
