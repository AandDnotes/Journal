        <h1>Friday 29th April</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Angela went down to the High Street to post Austin's birthday card and, after sending a couple of IET-related email, I fitted the water diverter in the down pipe on the front to the repositioned water butt. Angela also pruned a bush in the walled garden.</p>
        <p>Angela then spent most of the afternoon making cakes for the flower festival tomorrow. In fact she was still icing them at eight o'clock. I took the TC for a short run to warm up the engine and then drained the oil. I also removed the filter and cut down the new filter that I had bought, refitting the filter bowl with a new o-ring seal. I have my doubt that it will seal. Hopefully I can fill the engine with fresh oil tomorrow afternoon (and keep my fingers crossed).</p>
