        <h1>Tuesday 26th April</h1>
        <p>I overslept this morning and then we showered, so Angela went out before I had finished dressing. Then she pottered in the garden.</p>
        <p>Angela went out again later to collect a WI fee from someone and to go to the butchers. I spent most of the day working on IET email and making a new drawing of hybrid talk equipment connections. However, I also re-attached the fixing to the back of the number one on our house number.</p>
