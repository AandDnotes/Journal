        <h1>Friday 115th April</h1>
        <p>Good Friday and another busy day. It was such a warm, sunny morning that we decided to go for a walk after breakfast. We went up the twitten, up the Bostal and the 'snake path' and then up and around the upper horseshoe. Angela wanted to buy a leek from the High Street, so we stopped at Victoria Sponge for a coffee, sitting out on the pavement. It was 11:45 before we got home, having gone out at 9:30.</p>
        <p>The sun stayed out for the rest of the day and this evening it seems to be a full moon. Although I had put my overalls on, I started by clearing the grass that had grown against the garage wall on the twitten. Then I went into the garage, took off the front wheels and checked the tightness of the bolts on the front suspension. The near-side damper is still leaking, so the next job is to top it up.</p>
        <p>We ate early so that we could watch the TV programme the dinosaur extinction.</p>
