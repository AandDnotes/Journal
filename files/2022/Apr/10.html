        <h1>Sunday 10th April</h1>
        <p>A bright sunny day. While Angela went to church I tested the video capture device. The video output from the HP laptop could be selected as a Zoom input on the MacBook, even though it was the HP's second screen. However, although the sound appeared to be getting to the MacBook (at least one channel was) it could not be heard.</p>
        <p>Later I had a call from Mike who said that he was ill (going to the doctor's tomorrow) and wanted me to take on the microphone equipment. I don't think that includes the PA system.</p>
        <p>We also had our usual chat with Paul and Rowan.</p>
