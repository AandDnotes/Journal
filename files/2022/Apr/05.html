        <h1>Tuesday 5th April</h1>
        <p>Hamish collected me at ten and we went off to Falmer to meet Mike, Greg and Phil. We established that we could use the 'guest' wifi connection and connect to the projector and sound system. However, we had problems with setting up our equipment do do want we want. The clock in the lecture theatre was still on GMT, so we were late leaving.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I went to the doctors to have a prostate examination. It seems that my prostate is 'nice and soft', which seems to be a good thing. So my PSA level will be checked every 3-4 months.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended a Sussex Network talk on synchronous condensers. It had been set up by Ramon, but was hosted by Mike.</p>
