        <h1>Monday 25th April</h1>
        <p>A tiring day. Before we started we transferred Â£4,000 from Angela's RBS account to Dad's current account. This is a loan until his savings account matures on May 15th, since his RCI account has run out. I got the timing wrong!</p>
        <p>Angela went off to her exercise group and Martin picked me up to go to Ashurst. There were eight of us who went off on a walk of over eight miles, stopping for lunch on the way. The breeze was cool, but it was a mainly sunny day. Unfortunately the Fountain pub was closed when we got back. We then found that the Sun in Steyning was also closed. It was four o'clock before I got home.</p>
        <p>I uploaded the video of the last talk to our YouTube channel and added the link to our web page.</p>
