        <h1>Thursday 14th April</h1>
        <p>A very busy day. We started by going to the solicitors in the High Street to sign our new wills. We forgot to take our passports, so will need to take them in for copying. we then went on to Waitrose to do the weekly shop. Luckily we did not have much on the list and so we got to Victoria Grand before eleven.</p>
        <p>We spent an hour with Dad before going on to Halfords in Shoreham to buy a brake light for the Panda.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to a Maundy Thursday service and I replaced the broken brake light bulb on the Panda. It is quite a process to change a bulb. Then I put the TC up on axle stands in preparation for greasing and checking the tightness of bolts.</p>
