        <h1>Tuesday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Angela's birthday; 74 today. She had seven birthday cards, including a sheet of drawings from Austin and Juniper.</p>
        <p>I spoke to Dad and booked a visit for Thursday. We then walked down to the High Street to take our passports into the solicitors for copying and to buy a few items. I then walked down again to get my hair cut.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela went off to her WI meeting and I went into the garage to check the rear brakes on the TC. For some reason there is a little oil/grease in the nearside drum.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to cook dinner. I made an avocado and prawn starter and then herb crusted salmon. We had banana and cream for desert.</p>
