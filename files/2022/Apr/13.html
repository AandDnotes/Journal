        <h1>Wednesday 13th April</h1>
        <p>A good day. It was warmer than it has been, the sun shone on and off and it didn't rain. I took the TC off at about ten and drove to Ashington to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. David F-B came in his TR4A, which we left in the car park while we followed the route to Warham. There, I sat with Alan and his wife and we talked about T-series cars.</p>
        <p>Richard followed us around the route and then he gave David a lift back to Ashington, so I came directly home, arriving at 3:15 after doing a total of 52 miles. The car ran well.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went to the butchers and, after lunch, went to table tennis.</p>
