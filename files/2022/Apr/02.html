        <h1>Saturday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>A bright but chilly morning. In fact it stayed like that for most of the day, with just the occasional flurry of snow. We walked to the farmer's market (with some recycling material) and bought some rhubarb, then bought a newspaper and rolls.</p>
        <p>I spent a short time doing the weekly accounts and then quite a long time doing the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the number three by our front door fell off! So today I cleaned up the back and epoxied the fixings back on. It fell off once before, my glue is not a permanent solution.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria and then Angela watched 'La La Land' on catchup.</p>
