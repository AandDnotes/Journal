        <h1>Monday 28th February</h1>
        <p>The day started grey, became sunny during the afternoon and rained in the evening. Angela went to her exercise group, but didn't do any exercises, and I dismantled the TC's horn. Luckily, the wires were all intact and the failure to work was due to the adjustment. So I was able to reassemble it, adjusting as I went along, and get it to work when reassembled.</p>
        <p>During the morning I also charged the mower and drill batteries. Before lunch Angela cut the rear lawns. After lunch, and after talking with Dad, I cut the front grass. In all cases, we set the mower quite high.</p>
        <p>Later I joined the Eurotherm group for a chat and later still the IET Sussex Events meeting. Unfortunately, as often happens, I ended up with a number of actions.</p>
