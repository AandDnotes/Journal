        <h1>Wednesday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela delivered another batch of letters to people about the lunch club. I joined her. It was a sunny morning with little wind. We went out at ten and got home at 11:20, so were both quite tired.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I dealt with some email. Although I did need to stop to bring in the washing when it started to rain. I also read about the new Institutes of Technology.</p>
        <p>In the evening we tried to watch a 'catch-up' programme, but iPlayer on the iPad would not connect to the Chromecast, even though other players would. I had to uninstall and re-install iPlayer. Then it worked.</p>
