        <h1>Day/date</h1>
        <p>I thought it would take at least half an hour to walk to Bramber this morning, but in fact it only took 20 minutes. I went to meet up with the Eurotherm walking group. Just before I left, Angela went off to her exercise group. While we were walking to the four churches (St Peter's, St Botolphs, Combes and St Nicholas) Angela also went to her WI meeting.</p>
        <p>It was still blustery, but the sun occasionally came out and it stayed dry. We sheltered from the wind at the back of St Botolphs, standing in the sunshine, to eat our lunch. On our return to Bramber we tried to go in the Castle, but the garden table had gone and they didn't have space for the eight of us inside. So we went to the Kings Head. Luckily Martin gave me a lift home, just after 3:30.</p>
        <p>Before dinner I updated my newsletter, following comments from Greg, and submitted it.</p>
