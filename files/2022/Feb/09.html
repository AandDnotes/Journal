        <h1>Wednesday 9th February</h1>
        <p>We started by going to the Old Barn garden centre at Dial Post. After coffee Angela bought some plug plants to grow on for hanging baskets, some compost and some presents for Kate. It was a fine and quite sunny day. We were home before lunch.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her table tennis group and I spent time replying to an email from a local IET member about heat pump electricity usage. I also replied to Norman about visiting the Hawth and to an IET man who want to contact one of our past speakers.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended a Zoom talk on the Ford charging network. Interesting, but more a sales pitch.</p>
