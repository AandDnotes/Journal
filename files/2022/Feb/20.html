        <h1>Sunday 20th February</h1>
        <p>It has been another blustery day, although not as bad as Friday, with rain this afternoon. While Angela went to church I spent most of the day drafting my February IET Sussex newsletter. I finally sent it to Greg this evening for review. I also copied it to Steve so that he could start to learn about the process.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They have moved into the cottage and are both tired and a bit anxious. Rowan is staying with Greet and Wim, while Paul is taking a day or two off work. The builder has already been around to try to cover the bare parts of the roof with plastic sheet. Their neighbours have all been very helpful. They seem to have been the worst affected by the storm. Krista has cancelled bookings for the cottage for the next couple of months.</p>
