        <h1>Sunday 27th February</h1>
        <p>We had a clear blue sky all day, albeit with a chilly temperature. While Angela went to church I took the TC out for a run. I went up to Partridge Green and then back via Henfield, just 17 miles, but the car ran well after the engine had warmed up. However, I discovered that the horn is not working. Later I checked that 12 volts is getting to the horn when the button is pushed. So I removed the horn to investigate further.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They are expecting scaffolding to be erected on Tuesday and the roof to be fixed by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>Later we had a message from Victoria to say that they had arrived home after the Cub Scout camp. So we spoke to them after dinner. They seem to have enjoyed it even though it was very cold. So they did some sledging and Austin and Victoria did cross-county skiing. Their bathroom are progressing and should be finished within the next two weeks.</p>
