        <h1>Monday 14th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group and then to a WI committee meeting, I went for a walk around the roads. It only took 20 minutes, so was shorter than I had thought.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did some more research on both ISA investments and components needed to build a water temperature measuring device for the TC. Later I joined the Eurotherm group, which was shorter than usual, since people did not have much to report. I think we need to discuss topics rather than just report on what we have been doing.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the MG meeting at Washington. I sat with three MGB/C owners, which was interesting, but not as sociable as the couples. My quiz was run, which people seemed to enjoy.</p>
