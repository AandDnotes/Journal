        <h1>Friday 4th February</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. We started by going to M&S at Holmbush to do the weekly shop. It was almost lunchtime by the time we got home. Then I went to the dentist for a check-up.</p>
        <p>Later I started preparing the IET's form for holding physical events.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went off again, this time to Hillbarn Golf Club for a SRFC meeting. A talk was given by an air traffic controller at Shoreham. It was mildly interesting.</p>
