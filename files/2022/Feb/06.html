        <h1>Sunday 6th February</h1>
        <p>Luckily the rain stopped just before Angela left to walk to church. I tackled the next of my actions about restarting live events, emailing Norman about what we want to do at the Hawth. Then I took photos of paintings and items in the two bedrooms. Later I started adding them to the 'gallery' web site.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Paul. They had done as little as us.</p>
