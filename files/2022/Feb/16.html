        <h1>Wednesday 16th February</h1>
        <p>I spent the morning driving to Crawley, testing their wifi/broadband and driving home. It was fine apart from the four lanes of stationary traffic on the A23. Luckily it moved after a couple of minutes. All our test worked and I was home in time to prepare lunch.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and I did a little more research on thermocouple devices and did some reading.</p>
