        <h1>Monday 7th February</h1>
        <p>A slightly hazy sun became brighter as the morning wore on, but then disappeared behind cloud after lunch. Luckily the temperature was about ten degrees and there was only a light wind.</p>
        <p>We both went out twice during the day, Angela to her exercise group in the morning and then to the High Street later. I deposited an old pair of shoes in the recycling bin in Fletchers Croft car park and then went to the pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription. On the way back I called in to 'Body Matters' and made an appointment to see the podiatrist during the afternoon.</p>
        <p>So after lunch, after talking with Dad, I went down to the High Street again and had the hard skin on my feet removed with a scalpel and a sanding disk. She also cleaned up my toenails to make those on my left foot more amenable to 'fungal nail' fluid. She also commented that the sole of my left foot had something similar to athletes foot and so would benefit from some treatment. Therefore I went from there to the pharmacist (again) to buy some fresh athletes foot cream and some fungal nail treatment. I have already used it for three months and, although the podiatrist thought that it didn't look too bad, thought they would benefit from another course of treatment. However, she said that my feet were in good condition and were 'nice', but she probably says that to everyone.</p>
