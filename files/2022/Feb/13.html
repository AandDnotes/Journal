        <h1>Sunday 13th February</h1>
        <p>You could say that it was a day of two halves. The morning was dry, if cold and breezy and the afternoon was wet. In fact, it continued raining into the evening.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church (in the dry), I renewed an OakNorth savings bond that is due to mature later this month. I then brought the web site on the Raspberry pi up to date with the one on GitHub. Then I looked further at stocks and shares ISAs. Since the state of the stock market when we 'buy' the fund (consisting mainly of shares) will determine it growth potential, we will leave it for a week or two until the Ukraine situation settles.</p>
        <p>Later I researched items for a temperature probe for the TC and emailed Hamish with a question. Both he and Simon replied. Then, a little later than usual, we spoke with Paul. They had been to visit Krista's brother and his family.</p>
