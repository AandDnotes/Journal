        <h1>Saturday 4th February</h1>
        <p>A fairly quiet day. It started bright, but became overcast and windy.</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper I did the weekly accounts, paid Dad's paper bill and then finished my draft IET live event form, which I sent off to the others for review.</p>
        <p>Juniper had been to gymnastics, which she wouldn't tell us about, so we spoke to them quite late.</p>
