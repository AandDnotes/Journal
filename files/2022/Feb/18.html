        <h1>Friday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Today was all about storm Eunice. When we woke, the wind warning for our area had been raised from amber to red, the highest and forecasting winds of 80-90 miles per hour. The red warning includes danger to life, with expected flying debris. Needless to say, Mike Dillamore, who was due to come round at ten, decided to stay home. So we delayed his handover of the IET Sussex Twitter account until next week.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning producing a drawing of the device connections needed for a 'hybrid' event. Later I added a drawing of a minimal system. I then sent them to Mike for him to check/correct them.</p>
        <p>Luckily, the storm seems to have left us unscathed. I only had to rescue the compost bucket and Angela moved the wheelbarrow. Then I did a little more looking at components for a TC water temperature measure.</p>
