        <h1>Thursday 10th February</h1>
        <p>We had a shorter morning than usual, since we were going off to see Dad and needed to be at Victoria Grand by 1:30. So all I only managed to send an email to the IET about a request from one of our local members. I had a good reply later in the day.</p>
        <p>The traffic was light, so we arrived at Victoria Grand. We did our lateral flow test before going in, then showed Dad some photos and videos. We also rearranged the supplementary heaters. Then we were off to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop and fill up with (expensive) petrol.</p>
