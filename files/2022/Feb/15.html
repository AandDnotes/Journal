        <h1>Tuesday 15th February</h1>
        <p>Angela walked to the butchers and other shops while I did more research on making a temperature measuring device for the TC. Later, she went, in the rain, to a WI committee meeting. I discovered that I could buy a device for less than it wold take to make one, even though I already have two of the components. I also updated the MacBook OS.</p>
        <p>After dinner I spoke with someone who is just starting out as a STEM Ambassador.</p>
