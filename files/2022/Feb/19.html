        <h1>Saturday 19th February</h1>
        <p>Luckily, after a very windy (storm Eunice) and wet day yesterday, the morning was breezy, but dry. The rain started at lunchtime. We didn't have any problems due to the wind. However, Paul was not so lucky. Overnight they lost large sections of the roof on the barn, plus a few tiles on the cottage. Later, when it started raining, they had to put buckets around the house.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday, we went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and I did the weekly accounts. I also checked that I had enough pcb sockets for my thermocouple device. Then it was time to start preparing for my February newsletter. Unfortunately I realised that I had missed the last talk and so could not write a review. Although Greg did send a contribution.</p>
