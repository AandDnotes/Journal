        <h1>Tuesday 8th February</h1>
        <p>Another fairly bright day with light winds. Angela walked to the High Street and I emailed Julie about using an iPhone as a QR code reader to register attendees at our events. Since I was going out after lunch I did my Dutch lessons beforehand. I also took photos of the items in the study and added them to my 'gallery' web site.</p>
        <p>I went to the RCEA talk about the Solar Orbiter. Luckily there was little traffic either on the way there or on the way back.</p>
