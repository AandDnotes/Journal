        <h1>Thursday 17th February</h1>
        <p>Part of my morning was spent reducing the size of the iMovie-created mp4 file of the edited ESA talk and uploading it to YouTube. Later I added a link from our IET Sussex web site. I also spent some time over the day trying to come up with a cheaper version of a home-made temperature measurement device for use in the TC.</p>
        <p>Angela updated her lunch club letter and some other documents.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we went off to Victoria Grand, did our lateral flow test and then went in to see Dad. Although he was unshaven, he seemed well. We were pleased to see that one of the carers was coming into his room to play games with him. After that, we went to Waitrose for a cup of tea and to do the weekly shop. Luckily they had packs of Werther's Originals for Â£1, so I didn't need to go off around Worthing to find some.</p>
        <p>After dinner Angela joined a Zoom meeting for Sussex WI Treasurers.</p>
