        <h1>Saturday 26th February</h1>
        <p>We got up half an hour later than usual this morning, but then walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper, before continuing around part of the Rifle Range. We went out just before ten and got home just after eleven. It was sunny, with just a light breeze, so felt like Spring. In fact, it stayed like that all day. The rest of the morning was spent reading the paper, mainly about the situation in Ukraine.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I did the weekly accounts, including a reconciliation against a bank statement. I also watched the live streaming of the FLL UK final in Harrogate (most of which was obviously not live).</p>
