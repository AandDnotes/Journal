        <h1>Saturday 12th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to the church to help them clear leaves at the back and I walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper. When I got back, apart from reading the paper, I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Other than talking with Victoria after she returned from Juniper's gymnastic class, most of the afternoon was spent doing further research on stocks and shares ISAs. Although I did email Bronagh of the ICE about joint events.</p>
