        <h1>Thursday 24th February</h1>
        <p>This was the day that Russia invaded Ukraine!</p>
        <p>Quite a busy day, with rain (heavy at times) before we set off for the supermarket. We went to Waitrose and then on to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. We had taken a flask of coffee, so sat in the car while waiting for our test to 'develop' and drank it. He seemed well, but had lost two pairs of trousers!</p>
        <p>After we got home we had a hailstorm.</p>
        <p>I did more research on Institutes of Technology and started drafting a reply to Greg. I also produced a start slide and speaker introduction for Tuesday's talk.</p>
