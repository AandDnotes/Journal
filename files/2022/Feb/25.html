        <h1>Friday 25th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the butchers, Mike Dillamore called and we went through the IET Sussex Twitter account. I will 'tweet' details of the next talk and the availability of the recording. Mike still has access in case I need his help. My aim is to pass this on to the next Communications Officer when Ferheen finishes.</p>
        <p>I finally finished my reply to Greg about Institutes of Technology. I also emailed my contact at UK Power Network, quite late in the day, and was surprised to get a reply this evening.</p>
