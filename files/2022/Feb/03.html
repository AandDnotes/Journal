        <h1>Thursday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>I had a disturbed night. My stomach was upset and I had a bad bout diarrhoea at about 3:30. Luckily, apart from feeling a little fragile, all has been well today.</p>
        <p>We had a quiet morning and an early lunch before leaving at 1:15 to go to Victoria Grand to pick up Dad. We took him to the eye clinic at Sayers Common. He saw five different people, who measured and photographed his eyes, tested them, asked lots of medical history questions and finally examined his eyes. It seems that the cataract in his left eye is too mature for them to be able to remove it there. They can't see behind it and so don't know how deep it is. To have it removed he would need to go to their clinic in Woking or be referred to Worthing, where there is a one year waiting list. He wasn't keen on the idea in the first place, so he decided live with it as it is. After taking back to Victoria Grand we got home at 6:30. He did well and I was quite tired.</p>
