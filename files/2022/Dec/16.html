        <h1>Friday 16th December</h1>
        <p>Another mainly below zero day. Angela went off this morning to where a WI sponsored tree was due to be planted. But it was too cold, so had been postponed. Angela went in case any members came along expecting a planting ceremony. I suspect that she spent more time in Celia's house drinking coffee. Meanwhile I made notes on yesterday evening's PEI meeting and dealt with other email.</p>
        <p>Then, after lunch, I investigated the problem with the garage door. It had started stopping and reversing just before it closed. I had to disengage the motor and close it manually. So I simply squirted the wheels with some WD40 and it worked, at least it closed twice. Meanwhile, Angela delivered Christmas cards to Kingsmead Close. I also did a little more investigation of the Raspberry Pi html/css guide.</p>
