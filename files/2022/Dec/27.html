        <h1>Tuesday 27th December</h1>
        <p>We had some very heavy rain (possibly hail) at about three o'clock this morning, but by the time that we got up the weather had improved. However, it was still cold.</p>
        <p>We had two outings, the first this morning when we went to Krimpen-aan-de-Lek to visit Greet and Wim. We sat in their conservatory (with a number of cats) and drank coffee. We couldn't stay long since we had to get back for lunch so that we could go out again, this time to Bergambacht, where Krista and Rowan were both to have their hair cut. While they were in the hairdresser we walked around the town (getting quite cold), eventually going into the ice cream shop for coffee. Krista and Rowan joined us (both with shorter hair) and Rowan had ice cream! We got home just before it got dark.</p>
