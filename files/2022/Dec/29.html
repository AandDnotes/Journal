        <h1>Thursday 29th December</h1>
        <p>Another very windy night, although it became a bright, sunny day, both in the Netherlands and the UK. We were not up particularly early and only did a little to the jigsaw puzzle before we had to leave for the Metro station. That was at about 11:15. Paul and Rowan took us to Capelsebrug and we did the usual journey to Rotterdam Centraal. There, we found that the fast train to Schiphol had been cancelled, as had the next fast train. It seems that a train had broken down. So we caught the 'slow' train. That was crowded and, although it stared on time, it was 15 minutes late by the time it got to the airport. We hurried to the bag drop (we had already checked in) and then through security and passport control before heading for the gate, which was a long walk. As we arrived they started boarding. So we just went to the loo.</p>
        <p>The flight was on time, touching down at Gatwick at ten to three, and there were no queues at all at passport control. Then we only had to wait five minutes for our bags. So we had a cup of tea and a sandwich before catching the bus to the car park. We pulled into the garage at 4:45. It didn't take us long to turn on the house and unpack.</p>
