        <h1>Friday 9th December</h1>
        <p>We had to catch up with weekly doings, such as grocery shopping. So we set off for Holmebush, did the grocery shopping in Tesco, had coffee in M&amp;S and Angela bought two thermal vests.</p>
        <p>On our way home we stopped at Dave Posner's house to pick up the speaker gifts that he had. We had to wait for a few minutes since he and his wife were on their way home from Tesco! We now have 15 power banks, albeit with the old IET logo.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drafted an email to members of the PEI group and asked Colin Cunningham if he would set up a Zoom meeting. He did, so I could send my email later in the evening.</p>
