        <h1>Sunday 11th December</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast said that it would be cold and frosty this morning. It was. However, it was suggesting that the expected snow showers coming off the Channel would affect Kent and Essex and miss Sussex. The forecasters were wrong. Just after lunch there were a few flakes, which settled, but then later in the afternoon there were bigger and more flakes coming down for longer.</p>
        <p>Angela was at church this morning (in the hall since the boiler for the church has broken) and I wrapped secret Santa presents, gave the dibber another coat of oil and did most of the weekly accounts, reconciling against the statement. It took a while to find why my smaller Invensys pension was over three time higher than usual. I finished it off after lunch, searching for an error.</p>
        <p>Angela was back at the church this afternoon, helping at a Christmas-related event. When she got home she agreed with Phylis to cancel tomorrow's lunch club, so phoned the helpers while I cooked dinner. So my investigation of Christmas music to play in the hall tomorrow was wasted. Before that we spoke with Paul.</p>
