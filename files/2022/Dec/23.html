        <h1>Friday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>Rowan had gone to school before we were up this morning, although she finished at midday since it was the last day of term. It was quite wet for most of the day, so we didn't venture out much. The wind picked up during the evening.</p>
        <p>After lunch Krista went out for an appointment and to do some food shopping. Paul, Angela and I built a 3-D jigsaw puzzle of the Elizabeth Tower. It had LED lights inside that changed colour. Meanwhile, Rowan played a Pokemon game.</p>
        <p>Before it got dark I helped run the ponies up and down the drive, to stretch their legs. I led Freda. After dinner we played a game for a while. There seems to be a severe winter storm in North America, reaching down as far as Florida. So we are hoping that Victoria et al have not tried to drive up to Missouri.</p>
