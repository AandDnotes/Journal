        <h1>Wednesday 21st December</h1>
        <p>The shortest day, so in some respects things should start looking up from here. However, it did rain for quite a while today.</p>
        <p>Most of our time was spent preparing for our travels tomorrow. I got the cases down from the loft, checked in for our flights, and changed our seats, then printed off our boarding cards. I also printed our car park receipt in case the number plate recognition doesn't work.</p>
        <p>After lunch we started packing and soon discovered that the two carry-on size cases were not big enough! So I went back up in the loft and brought down a larger case. Everything fitted and even then the case only weighed about 11 Kg (the allowance is 23 Kg). Otherwise it was a case of collecting together things like passports, cash and health cards.</p>
        <p>I did find time to have a little play with my web page about our cottage in Wales.</p>
