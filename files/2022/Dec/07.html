        <h1>Wednesday 7th December</h1>
        <p>A dry, mainly sunny day, but cold. And it's due to get colder!</p>
        <p>I created a small Adestra email about the Surrey talk on 'return to the moon', but made mistakes in the first attempt. The second hasn't yet been approved and the talk is tomorrow!</p>
        <p>Following email about maturing bonds I opted to reinvest them. Then, while Angela was at table tennis I finished the dibber. Hopefully the smell of the teak oil will disappear before we go to Berkenwoude.</p>
        <p>I also phoned Hamish. We then changed to FaceTime so that he could show me the 'how to turn on/off the TV'. He is forgetting things like that.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we walked down to the High Street to the Christmas fair. All we did was buy some raffle tickets and take some photos and videos.</p>
