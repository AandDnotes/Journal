        <h1>Monday 12th December</h1>
        <p>Not the day that we had planned. Everywhere had a covering of snow (about an inch deep) and so looked pretty. But Angela had already cancelled the lunch club, so we set off early to the church to put the sliced turkey in the freeze. Later Angela brought it back and put it in our freezer because she though that the church freezer was not working. It was, she just hadn't left it long enough. She then went round to Phylis's to help contact people who were expecting to come to lunch.</p>
        <p>I came home and cleared part of the drive up to the front door and in front of the Panda, since we were expecting to go out later. Angela thought it would just be slippery, although I had put down some road salt. I also updated the Linux and Windows systems.</p>
        <p>Angela persuaded me that it would be too risky to go to the MG club Christmas party. Although the main roads were clear, the local roads still had compacted snow or slush on them and it was going to freeze agin tonight. So I emailed Juliet and Angela cooked a pasta dish for dinner.</p>
