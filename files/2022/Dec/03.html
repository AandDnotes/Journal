        <h1>Saturday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>Being Saturday we took our usual walk to the High Street. Angela took some recycling items to the monthly market and I bought a newspaper. We were too early to go to the craft fair, so we came home. It was calm and dry, but quite cold, so we stayed in for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning and little of the afternoon doing the weekly and monthly accounts. The rest of the day was spent reading the newspaper.</p>
