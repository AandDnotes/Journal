        <h1>Sunday 25th December</h1>
        <p>A wet Christmas Day in Berkenwoude. So we didn't go out. In fact, the ponies came in early.</p>
        <p>For dinner (in the evening) we had a 'cook your own pieces of meat on a hotplate' meal. We cooked peppers and mushrooms as well and had satay sauce and bread. Greet and Wim joined us during the afternoon and for dinner. In fact it was their hotplate.</p>
        <p>We played games during the day and after dinner. We also had a quick chat with Victoria. They managed to get through to Kansas City yesterday, having met some road closures and following gritters.</p>
