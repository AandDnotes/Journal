        <h1>Tuesday 13th December</h1>
        <p>Angela checked the church freezer this morning when she went down to the High Street. Since it had frozen the turkey gravy we then took the turkey out of our freeze and put it in the church freezer. While she was out I ordered Amazon gift cards for Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA talk at Field Place. We still had some compacted snow on the road in front of our house, but the main roads were clear and there was no snow in Worthing. The talk was on the design or RNLI lifeboats. I got home at five o'clock.</p>
        <p>I received an email from the Probate Registry to say that our probate application had been approved. They are sending the certificates by post, so goodness knows when they will arrive. So I phoned Alan to tell him.</p>
