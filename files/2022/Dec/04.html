        <h1>Sunday 4th December</h1>
        <p>A chilly, but dry day. While Angela was at church I spent an hour in the garage cutting the mortice and tenon on the dibber. Then I created a 'start slide' for Tuesday's talk.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and a little later with Paul. Victoria et al had been to their town's Winter Walk and Paul had the family there for the day since it was Sinter Klaus day.</p>
