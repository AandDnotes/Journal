        <h1>Tuesday 20th December</h1>
        <p>It stayed dry today and mainly sunny, although a little cooler than yesterday and with a brisk breeze. Angela went of on the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash. Unfortunately the return bus broke down before it got to Storrington and so she had to wait an hour for the next bus. Luckily she got home in time for lunch, if a little cold.</p>
        <p>After a slow start I worked on my new html/css template. I 'finished' it later, although it will evolve over time. Apart form the link style, all style statements are with classes. I then moved the start of my page on the cottage to the now template, changing it from a spiral notebook style to an open book style.</p>
        <p>We also did a little towards our preparations for going away on Thursday. Since we are returning on a day when the Border Force are on strike, BA have offered to change or flight to another day without cost. However, we hope to be able to use our E-passports to get back into the UK without too much ow a wait.</p>
