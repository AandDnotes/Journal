        <h1>Friday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>Not a particularly productive day. Angela went to the High Street and library while I replied to some email. After an early lunch (main meal) we went into Worthing so that Angela could go to her ENT appointment to have a hearing test. I bought a few things in Waitrose and then went in search of some things for the lunch club. We met in Waitrose for a cup of tea and then went back into Worthing, but without buying anything. We were in search of Christmas paper napkins.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening I went to the flying club Christmas party, which was quite good, even though it was only talking and eating.</p>
