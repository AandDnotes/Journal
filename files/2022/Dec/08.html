        <h1>Thursday 8th December</h1>
        <p>The temperature outside only just got above freezing today!</p>
        <p>We left at 11:45 and got home at about 3:30. We went to the Roundabout Hotel at West Chiltington for the RCEA Christmas Lunch. There were about 50 people, it was a nice place and the food was good. There was just too much of it. We had three courses, plus little mince pies and coffee.</p>
        <p>We didn't eat anything more for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>During the early evening I watched a talk on 'returning to the moon' that had been advertised by the IET Surrey Network. I had sent our members the link to the YouTube channel. There were 60 people waiting, but it didn't start. By chance I found it on another channel. It started with presentations from Surrey students saying how good the Engineering Department was. The talk was mostly about the history of lunar research and visits, with a little on future plans.</p>
