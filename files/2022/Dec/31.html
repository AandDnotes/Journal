        <h1>Saturday 31st December</h1>
        <p>The last day of 2022! And it rained for most of the day. Angela was ready before I was dressed and so went to buy a newspaper, which meant that I didn't go out, not even to put anything in the vegetable waste bucket.</p>
        <p>Paul sent a photo of the completed jigsaw puzzle!</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts (which covered two weeks, but there wasn't a lot of Visa slips) and went online to choose the maturity options. I also started monthly accounts, but didn't get very far. However, I did add some music to my Scratch project of a ballerina and bear and sent it to Rowan.</p>
        <p>We had a message to Victoria to say that they were home from Missouri and later Brandon posted some photos.</p>
