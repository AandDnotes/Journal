        <h1>Tuesday 6th December</h1>
        <p>A bright, dry, but cold day. I wrote notes about Hamish's contribution to the Sussex Network for Julie and downloaded and printed the attendance list for the evening's talk.</p>
        <p>The evening's talk went on a bit, but was reasonably well attended. I didn't get home until after ten.</p>
