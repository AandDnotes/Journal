        <h1>Saturday 10th December</h1>
        <p>A slightly earlier start today. We set off at about nine o'clock in the freezing cold to collect the turkey roll from the butcher. I collected a newspaper on route and then we went to the church hall kitchen to cook it. We ended up decorating a tree in the hall while Cathy and Bill put up other Christmas decorations.</p>
        <p>We had to wait until the meat thermometer, which was buried in the centre of the roll, reached 70 degrees for a couple of minutes. We then took it out of the oven to cool and went home for a late lunch.</p>
        <p>Then it was a return trip to slice the roll using the electric slicer. The meat was left in the fridge and we washed the slicer and baking tray. It was still bitterly cold, but we were home at 4:30.</p>
        <p>We spoke to Victoria before we cooked dinner, which was probably a mistake since she went on for over an hour.</p>
