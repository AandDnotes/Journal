        <h1>Monday 26th December</h1>
        <p>Boxing Day and I was the last awake this morning. The rest of the day followed a similar pattern. In other words, I didn't go outside the door.</p>
        <p>Rowan and I did a little more Scratch programming and we played games. And that was about it. However, it was a much better  day weather-wise. After some heavy rain in the morning and a grey start, it turned sunny, if windy and cold (or so I was told.)</p>
