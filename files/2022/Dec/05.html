        <h1>Monday 5th December</h1>
        <p>I had a relatively early start (9:30) with a Teams meeting with Mark Cunningham to go through the Sussex Network's use of Twitter and LinkedIn. he will take over the use of these two from now on.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group I spent an hour in the garage finishing the mortice and tenon on the dibber. I left it gluing. I now only need to cut off the end of the tenon, sand the whole thing and then oil it. I should be able to finish it on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A lot of the afternoon was spent reading the newspaper and other things. Angela walked down to the High Street to buy a few things.</p>
