        <h1>Wednesday 14th December</h1>
        <p>This morning I went for a haircut in the High Street. To my surprise, Angela thought it was good. The haircut that is.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday Angela went to table tennis after lunch. Meanwhile I tried to install the Arduino IDE on the Linux system, and almost succeeded. I tried a new .appimage version. Then I looked at Ramon's recording of Mike's talk. He had added a title sequence, but not removed the adverts at the beginning.</p>
