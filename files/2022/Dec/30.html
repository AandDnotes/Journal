        <h1>Friday 30th December</h1>
        <p>Today we started getting back into our routine. It was raining early and so later in the morning we went off to Lyons Farm to shop. One of the handles on our wardrobe doors had broken before we went away, so I bought a new set from B&amp;Q, fitting them later in the day.</p>
        <p>We did other things such as putting the cases back in the loft and hanging up the Christmas cards that had arrived while we were away. Angela also made some soup as well as cooking dinner.</p>
