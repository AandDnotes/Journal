        <h1>Sunday 18th December</h1>
        <p>It rained all day, but I brought the cases down from the loft this morning, and found a mouse in one of the traps! Otherwise we read the paper, did our Dutch lessons and Angela cooked our main meal. She went to a carol service, starting at four o'clock and didn't think she would be back in time to cook. I also printed our flight itinerary.</p>
        <p>We were able to speak with Paul before Angela went out. She wasn't back until around six o'clock. I managed to wrap the dibber while she was out, but otherwise red the paper.</p>
