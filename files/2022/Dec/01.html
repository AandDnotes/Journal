        <h1>Thursday 1st December</h1>
        <p>The first day of meteorological winter. We now need to 'survive' December, January and February before we get to spring.</p>
        <p>We started by going to Dunelm to buy some small cushions to give to Sandy in exchange for the 'horse' cushion that she made. We went in for two cushions, but bought three, plus a soap dish, a birthday card and a dressing gown for me (for Christmas). We did have coffee in between.</p>
        <p>Then we went off to Lidl to do the bulk of the weekly grocery shop. We can buy any remaining items at Waitrose tomorrow when Angel goes to ENT at Worthing Hospital. We got home just in time to prepare lunch!</p>
        <p>The day had become quite sunny, with little wind, so just before 2:30 we went off for a walk. We went down the path that is opposite the coach park of the Grammar School, then through to Mouse Lane. We were out for about an hour.</p>
        <p>The replacement MacBook port adapter (hub) arrived today, so I checked that the HDMI port worked (I mirrored the display on the TV) and then email thanks to MOKiM.</p>
        <p>I also set Mark C up as a contributor to both our IET Sussex Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. We have a Teams meeting on Monday morning.</p>
