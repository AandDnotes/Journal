        <h1>Monday 19th December</h1>
        <p>The rain stopped a little before lunchtime, but Angela got wet going down to her exercise group. However, it was quite warm, with only a slight breeze. After lunch Angela was off again, this time to her WI meeting. I walked down to the Post Office a bought some Euros, partly to give as Christmas presents and partly just to have a little more cash. Otherwise I started putting together an html/css template that puts all the style definitions into classes, uses css variables and allows for different size devices.</p>
