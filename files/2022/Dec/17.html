        <h1>Saturday 17th December</h1>
        <p>According to both the iPad and out outdoor thermometer it was -4 degrees when we got up. During the day it rose to +4, so some of the snow and ice started melting.</p>
        <p>Consequently we dressed up to walk down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. At least the ground through the twittens was frozen and not muddy.</p>
        <p>After reading some of the paper I did the weekly accounts and then did some IET work. This included putting the link to the last talk on our web page, asking Mark to post to Twitter and LinkedIn and answering a few other email.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria et al, which finished quickly since Rowan wanted to play a game online with Austin. Later, on and off, I 'played' with my web page based on the Raspberry Pi html/css guide.</p>
