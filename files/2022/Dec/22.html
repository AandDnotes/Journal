        <h1>Thursday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>We had a earlier start than usual, and set off to Gatwick at a quarter to nine (15 minutes later than planned). However, we were there on time and soon got through the bag drop and security. The only problem was that the flight, scheduled for 11:40, was delayed by an hour. So we had an early lunch at Gatwick, rather than a late lunch at Schiphol. Then we were soon out of the airport and caught the fast train to Rotterdam.</p>
        <p>It was raining when we left home and raining when we arrived at Capelsebrug. After five minutes Paul and Rowan arrived to drive us to Berkenwoude (in the dark and rain). We stayed in the barn, rather than the cottage as we had thought.</p>
