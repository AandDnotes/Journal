        <h1>Saturday 24th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Eve, although we had our (more) traditional Christmas dinner in the evening. And it was dry, warm, calm and sunny for a good part of the day.</p>
        <p>Paul and I re-attached the bannister rail in the cottage. Luckily we could just use some longer screws since the brackets seemed to be screwed into wooden studs.</p>
        <p>Rowan and I spent some time 'playing' with Scratch coding. She did very well. After dinner, when we had crackers and wore paper hats, we watched her favourite film, an animation about a horse.</p>
