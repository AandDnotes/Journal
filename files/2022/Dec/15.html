        <h1>Thursday 15th December</h1>
        <p>Due to the cold weather we decided to do our weekly shop after lunch. So Angela bought some rolls in the High Street while I sent some emails and started 'playing' with new html/css templates.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to Lyons Farm. The Bostal was still closed, so we went down to the Shoreham flyover. I bought a timer, since the ones left by Brandon are not working.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the PEI group meeting. At least there were five of us this time and everyone insisted that the group should continue.</p>
