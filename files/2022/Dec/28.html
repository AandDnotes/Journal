        <h1>Wednesday 28th December</h1>
        <p>After a windy (and noisy) night I don't think that either of us went out today. There was rain at times, so we played Catan (badly) and then, after lunch, started a jigsaw puzzle. It was a cartoon picture, with a very small image, so the light was not good enough most of the time. Needless to say we didn't finish it, although we did get the outside edge completed.</p>
        <p>Today was our last full day, so I checked in for our flights and Paul printed out boarding cards. We will pack in the morning.</p>
