        <h1>Tuesday 24th May</h1>
        <p>We had mainly dry morning, with thunder storms just after lunch. So Lester 1 decided that he couldn't do any more. He will try to finish it off while we are away. He did ask, however, that we gave him a part payment. Because Lester was laying slabs around the back gate and in the front, we could only go out via the garage.</p>
        <p>I spent some time uploading our Covid documents to the BA site and, once they had been verified, checked in and printed our boarding cards.</p>
        <p>Angela walked down to the High Street after lunch to get some milk and we put out (and later packed) things to take. Then after an early dinner I joined the last Sussex Network talk as backup. The talk was a little disappointing.</p>
