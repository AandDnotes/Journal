        <h1>Monday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>A bank holiday and so the flower festival was open again. Angela went down quite early and I followed a little later after looking up train times between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam.</p>
        <p>The lunch sales were slower than on Saturday, but overall it was quite busy.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch I hurried home, arriving before Greg and Ramon arrived to look at using the new video camera for a hybrid event. We found that we needed to use my video capture device in order to get the video signal into a MacBook. However, we could not get the sound from the camera's microphone into Zoom. We think that, with the correct adapter, we can plug the microphone directly into the MacBook. The other problem was that the camera will not zoom when it is acting as a webcam.</p>
        <p>Greg will buy a suitable cable and adapter and arrange to try the camera out at the Hawth.</p>
