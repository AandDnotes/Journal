        <h1>Wednesday 4th May</h1>
        <p>A tiring day, but not due to the activities that we expected. While we were getting ready to go to Gatwick to catch a flight to Amsterdam, Paul sent a message to say that Krista had been ill and had this morning tested positive to Covid-19. So we decided to cancel our trip. Paul will have enough to do without looking after us and the risk of us catching Covid and being stuck in the Netherlands was too great.</p>
        <p>We cancelled our flights (by phone), the only refund being the taxes. We were also too late to get a refund on the parking.</p>
        <p>So we decided to go to Nymans gardens for coffee and then for lunch, as well as a good walk around. On the way home we bought tickets for the film (West Side Story) at the Steyning Centre in the evening, which was enjoyable. Thus we are tired.</p>
