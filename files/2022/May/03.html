        <h1>Tuesday 3rd May</h1>
        <p>Today was all about preparing for our trip tomorrow. During the day we collected the things that we needed to pack.</p>
        <p>Angela did some washing and cut the grass this morning (luckily before there was a short shower of rain). She also did some 'pottering' in the garden. She noticed that the 'plug' on one side of the garden bin top was missing. I had made a wooden one when the original plastic plug was lost. I made one from a piece of plastic pipe, although I think it might easily come out, even though I hammered it in.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I had a Teams discussion with Steve West about the Sussex LN. He will chair the September meeting.</p>
