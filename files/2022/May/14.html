        <h1>Saturday 14th May</h1>
        <p>Since Angela was going to a coffee morning, I went to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. We met in the twitten as I came home. So I did the weekly accounts and replied to email about the recording of the talk.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela completed removing plants and I cut the grass. Then I uploaded the video to YouTube, added the link to our web site and posted on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
