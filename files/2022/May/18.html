        <h1>Wednesday 18th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking group before Lester arrived. He had been off to collect the turf. So he spent the morning laying the turf and pointing the slabs. He also put gravel in the drainage slot, so there are just a couple of bits to finish off.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning sorting out Dad's matured savings bond. I put part into his 'easy access' account and opened a one-year bond with the rest. I also paid back the loan from Angela's RBS account and started looking at ISA options for Angela's ISA that is about to mature.</p>
        <p>Later Lester demolished the front wall and removed the slabs on the front and side. He also broke up the top surface of the concrete path in the kitchen garden. We need to water the turf three times a day, so I did that this evening. It took a while to work out which piece of the spray you had to turn!</p>
        <p>I emailed Penny Atkins at Brighton and she agreed to give a talk next Spring.</p>
