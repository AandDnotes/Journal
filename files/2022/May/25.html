        <h1>Wednesday 25th May</h1>
        <p>A long, tiring day, and it is only ten o'clock. We got up at 5:30 and was in Gatwick South Terminal by 7:30. We had been advised to allow three hours to get through to air-side, but it only took us 30 minutes, so we had a bit of a wait before boarding. That happened on time, but the plane was held by air traffic control for nearly an hour. So we arrived at Schiphol late. Getting out of the airport was also reasonably quick, so we had lunch in the railway station. We bought a couple of take-away baguettes and cakes and found some public seats. Then I bought two new ov-chip cards we caught the 'slow' train to Rotterdam. We were expecting to use the direct train, but there didn't seem to be one at that time. We were met at Capelsebrug by Paul and Rowan (after us going three stops on the RET in the wrong direction).</p>
        <p>On top of that, Angela went off with Krista to watch Rowan's tennis lesson. Apparently it was quite cold. So after a poor night's sleep, an early start and our journey, we are quite tired.</p>
