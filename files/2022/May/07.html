        <h1>Saturday 7th May</h1>
        <p>A less hectic day. We walked down to the High Street to take some recycling to a collection point in the market and then to buy a newspaper, some milk and rolls.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, most of my day was spent doing the weekly and monthly accounts. Although we did spend a couple of hours talking with Victoria. Today Austin started taking a low dose of medication to help with his attention deficit.</p>
