        <h1>Tuesday 17th May</h1>
        <p>We didn't need to be up quite as early as lately, since Lester was collecting top soil before coming to us. So we showered and I was getting dressed when he arrived. It was the warmest day of the year so far.</p>
        <p>Lester started by unloading the top soil, then finished the brick edging, built the step and set the triangular base in the corner. Tomorrow he will lay the turf and grout the slabs, then move into the kitchen garden.</p>
        <p>Angela caught the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash, then sorted out her books when she got home. I did some research on the split cycle engine developed at Brighton with regard to getting a talk and started drawing up the design for the fence around the front door. Lester said that we will need to water the grass twice a day, so I went off to Wickes to buy a hose and fittings.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended the IET Sussex events meeting.</p>
