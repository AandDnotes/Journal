        <h1>Monday 30th May</h1>
        <p>Greet and Wim joined us for coffee (and cake).</p>
        <p>Krista picked up Rowan from school and we set off for the airport, stopping for a drink on the way at a motorway service station. However, it was head and shoulders above the M25 and M40 service stations we use.</p>
        <p>They dropped us off, we checked our bags and were through security within half an hour. So we wandered, sat and ate before going to the gate. We had already had an email saying the 7:30pm flight would be operated by Iberia, but it was firstly delayed by an hour, then by another. The plane arrived at 9pm and we were all aboard by 9:30. However, at Gatwick the plane was parked out in the sticks and we had to wait for a bus, followed by a long drive. Passport control was quick, but we had to wait over two hours for our bags.</p>
        <p>The we couldn't find our car. We had noted the wrong bus stop! We got home, through some torrential rain, at 2:30am and were in bed by three.</p>
