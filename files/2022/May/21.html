        <h1>Saturday 21st May</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday, we started by walking to the High Street. Angela bought rolls and I bought a newspaper. Then I went to the bookshop to by a ticket for the Steyning Festival talk on the Hubble telescope, before going on to the pharmacy to pick up my repeat prescription. Strangely it was morning coffee time when I got home.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the day putting back the plants she had dug up before the walled garden work was done. I grassed over the flower bed that we had dug up yesterday, using some of the left-over turf. Then I watered the new grass and that in the walled garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They are expecting Gene and Claudia on Thursday (or Friday), along with Becky and her family. They plan to go to the zoo and to the New Jersey science museum.</p>
        <p>Then more gardening for Angela while I did the weekly accounts and then patched a piece of 'dead' grass in the kitchen garden and watered the grass at both ends of the house. It was quite a warm and sunny day.</p>
