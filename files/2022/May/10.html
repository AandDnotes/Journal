        <h1>Tuesday 10th May</h1>
        <p>Lester the garden landscaper and his mate arrived at about 8:30. They removed the patio and all the grass in the walled garden and started digging the foundations for the edging. They left at 2:30, but will be back early tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her WI committee meeting after lunch and later in the afternoon I went to Crawley to prepare for the hybrid meeting that took place a little later. We only just got things working in time for the start. We catered for 40 people, but only a dozen turned up. We had 88 on Zoom. It was a tiring afternoon/evening.</p>
