        <h1>Monday 16th May</h1>
        <p>We were up early since Lester arrived at about 8:30. He finished removing the rest of the concrete and put most of the edging pavers in place. He will collect the topsoil tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her exercise group and I replied to a number of email, mainly with regard to the video camera and the recording of talks. Then I researched the various ways of getting to Rotterdam. I looked at the ferry, Eurostar, flying from City airport and flying from Gatwick. The latter is the cheapest. So after lunch, while Angela was at her WI meeting, I booked tickets. It turned out that the parking at Gatwick is cheaper than getting a taxi there and back.</p>
        <p>I also downloaded the Covid declaration forms and our certificates and printed them.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed the two speakers that I have lined up for the next season of talks. We also searched for garden furniture.</p>
