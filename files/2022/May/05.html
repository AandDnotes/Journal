        <h1>Thursday 5th May</h1>
        <p>We had to do some grocery shopping today. Although we normally do it on Thursdays we were not expecting to be here today or over the weekend. So we went off to Lyons Farm. I bought an HDMI connector from Currys while there. Although we were home by about 11:30, that seemed to essentially take all morning.</p>
        <p>Angela did some paper shredding and pottered in the garden until it was time to start cooking. I tidied away things after our abortive trip and removed weeds from part of the drive. I also emailed Lester to say that we would be here on Monday. I had an overload of email today, which took a while to process.</p>
