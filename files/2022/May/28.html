        <h1>Saturday 28th May</h1>
        <p>Paul and krista collected Lotta and Fenna from their Uncle Harry's wedding party and brought them here for the night. They and Rowan shared a bed in the spare room on the mezzanine. The girls were collected by Krista's brother later in the morning.</p>
        <p>Overall we had a quieter day, apart from a spell playing swing-ball with Rowan. Other games we played involved cards, sitting at the table, even though one was very complicated. I generated and uploaded a CPD certificate for the last talk. Paul booked tickets for Floriada tomorrow. We will need to be up early.</p>
