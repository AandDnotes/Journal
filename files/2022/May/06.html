        <h1>Friday 6th May</h1>
        <p>We continued our outings today by going to Borde Hill gardens, just north of Haywards Heath. We arrived in time to have coffee, then walked around the garden and a little of the woodland before having a sandwich for lunch.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny, warm day (we took off our sweaters), although it clouded over later in the afternoon. We got home at about 3:30. I prepared the start slide for Tuesday's talk and sent it to Mike, explaining what we had done about the hybrid event.</p>
