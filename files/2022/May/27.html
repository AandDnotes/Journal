        <h1>Friday 27th May</h1>
        <p>It took me a long time to get to sleep last night, partly due to the wind and a heavy rain shower. So I've been tired all day. However, my May newsletter has been approved and issued.</p>
        <p>We went off to Utrecht this morning. There was more traffic than expected, so it took longer, but we walked around and found somewhere for lunch. Then Krista caught the tram to the horse hospital and we walked around the old town (and had an ice cream) before joining her. She had gone to visit Archie, who has been castrated. He is in the hospital because they could only find one testicle.</p>
        <p>So we were quite tired by the time that we got home.</p>
