        <h1>Monday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>In spite of some rain early, Lesters 1 &amp; 2 arrived just after 8:30. He worked on the steps in the kitchen garden and at the front and the slabs around the manhole cover. He has a problem with the steps down to the drive and so went off at one o'clock to get some bricks</p>
        <p>Angela went to her exercise group this morning and then, after an early lunch, caught the bus to Storrington to bank some WI cash. I spent a lot of the day working on the May newsletter. I got the system to send a test email to Greg (and Steve) for review. I din't need to water the grass this morning, but did so before dinner.</p>
