        <h1>Sunday 15th May</h1>
        <p>Since Lester will be here early in the morning we had a shower this morning. Then Angela went to church and I tried to make sense of Mike Underhill's description of how the sound was connected last Tuesday. I failed. However, I researched the various types of 3.5 mm audio jacks. I then realised that, when I did the weekly accounts yesterday, I didn't reconcile them against the statement. So I did that before lunch.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with both Paul and Victoria, who had returned from a Scout camp that morning.</p>
        <p>In the evening we watched the Queen's Platinum Jubilee performance.</p>
