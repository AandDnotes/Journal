        <h1>Thursday 19th May</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Lester arrived just after nine, having picked up some sand. We went off straight away to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop, then to Waitrose for coffee before going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. It was overcast and threatening rain when we left, but by the time we got to Victoria Grand we were able to sit outside in the sun while waiting for our tests to mature. Dad seemed fine. A carer came out as we left to say that some of Dad's shirts were going around the collar and so needed a couple of new ones.</p>
        <p>Lester had to leave by 2:30 to take his truck for an MoT test. He will only come tomorrow if it is not raining. He had laid most of the slabs in the kitchen garden path and some in the front. We also 'rescued' the left-over turf from his truck.</p>
        <p>Angela started moving plants back into the walled garden and I dug up some plants that she wants to save from the flower bed on the south side. The idea is to dig out the rest and grass it over with the salvaged turf. I then watered the turf in the walled garden.</p>
