        <h1>Tuesday 31st May</h1>
        <p>In spite of our late bedtime we were up at 7:30. Most of the day was spent sorting things out, such as unpacking, email and accounts. Angela made some biscuits.</p>
        <p>After dinner we went to the talk on the Hubble telescope, Angela to make coffee, me to listen.</p>
