        <h1>Monday 9th May</h1>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the day helping at the lunch club, even though she was not on duty before lunch. I then went down for my lunch, which was quite good, particularly since I had seconds of both the main course and the pudding.</p>
        <p>I spent some time looking at BA flights for a visit to Paul et al later this month.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I attended the Eurotherm group Zoom chat, even though there was only Hamish, Martin and I. Then it was a quick tea before going off to Washington for the WSMGOC meeting. I sat with Chris and Maureen Rickard, although was shown a model of a TC by Graham (?) who bought quite some years ago at a car boot sale. He would like me to make him an offer for it.</p>
