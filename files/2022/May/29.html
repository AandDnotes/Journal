        <h1>Sunday 29th May</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up this morning. Not a good start to the day we intended going to the Floriane Expo 2022. Paul, Rowan, Angela and I left at about nine and arrived at the site by ten. We caught the courtesy bus for the five minute drive to the Expo site. There was a large area for parking, but few visitors. We got into the site and immediately took the cable car to the far end of the site. That part was probably the most interesting. The rest of the day was spent walking around the 'plots', greenhouses and playgrounds and stopping for coffee and lunch. We got home at about five, all feeling quite weary.</p>
        <p>Most plots only had one entrance, so it was difficult to work you way around the site. Some plots were built by companies, some by countries and some by environmental groups. It was quite difficult to work out from the map which plots you wanted to visit, so we tended to work our way around the playgrounds. Also, the whole site was fairly immature and will improve over the coming months.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening I checked-in to our flights for tomorrow afternoon and Paul printed our boarding passes.</p>
