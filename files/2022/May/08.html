        <h1>Sunday 8th May</h1>
        <p>Rowan's tenth birthday. And a fine, sunny and quite warm day.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to church and I wrote a letter to the cardiology consultant who 'accused' me of finding symptoms via a personal heart rate monitor that I would not otherwise have noticed. I also sent a few IET-related email.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a somewhat chaotic video call with Paul and Victoria. At least Austin and Juniper sang Happy Birthday to Rowan.</p>
