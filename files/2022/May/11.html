        <h1>Wednesday 11th May</h1>
        <p>We were up early, expecting Lester to arrive between eight and 8:30. However, he phoned to say that he had food poisoning and so would not come today. We were also up early because we were both going out. Angela went walking and I took the TC on a Wanders run.</p>
        <p>Only Angela and Felicity went walking, although others joined them at the Hub for coffee. I started by going to Beeding for some petrol and then went to the Spur at Slindon to meet the other Wanderers. That was about 20 miles. I joined Chris and Pete and then Richard Hobden, my navigator, arrived. We then set off on the run, with the hood down. Unfortunately, after about half the run, a little drizzle turned into quite a down-poor. We were following Peter's TC and Chris was behind us in his TF, so we all pulled into a gravelled area to put the hoods up. We were first away. It was Richard's first time in a TC and he had even more difficulty getting in and out when the hood was up.</p>
        <p>It had stopped raining by the time that we arrived at Chichester Yacht Club. I sat with Robin, the previous Commodore of the yacht club. He has an MGB, a Delorean, a Rolls Royce Corniche, a Jeep and a tuc-tuc. He is also about to buy an RX8!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately it was still drizzling when we left, so I dropped Richard back at the Spur and got home just before four, having done a total of 78 miles.</p>
        <p>Later we had a short chat with Austin on his tenth birthday.</p>
