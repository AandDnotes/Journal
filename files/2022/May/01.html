        <h1>Sunday 1st May</h1>
        <p>Lester arrived at about ten o'clock to 'walk through' the requirements for the walled garden, kitchen garden and front. The increased materials price is pushing the cost up Â£750! However, he will start doing some work on the front on the day that we return from the Netherlands and then hopes to finish all the work within two weeks. He suggested curving the outline of the patio and the corner that will hold the water feature.</p>
        <p>I then took the TC for a run up to Partridge Green so as to test that the oil filter assembly is not leaking. Luckily it doesn't seem to be. After lunch I checked for leaks after it had cooled and then tidied the garage.</p>
        <p>Then I did the weekly accounts. Angela returned to the flower festival and helped with cream teas, getting home at about six. We then had a chat with Paul.</p>
