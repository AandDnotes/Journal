        <h1>Friday 20th May</h1>
        <p>It started raining at about 7:15 this morning and continued through until midday. So Lester didn't come today, although we still had to get up early. This morning Angela did some housework and I completed the design for the fence around the front door. I will order the wood when we get back from the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Angela then spent most of the afternoon in the garden. We removed the plants from the flower bed on the south side of the kitchen garden and Angela planted some in the walled garden, along with others she had previously removed from there. I dug over the plot, trampled and raked it, in preparation for laying turf.</p>
        <p>I started planning my May newsletter, which I will need to complete whilst at Paul's, and also received a reply from the consultant cardiologist, who has now arranged for me to have a 24 hour ECG. However, he is still suggesting that it is nothing to worry about.</p>
