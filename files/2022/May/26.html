        <h1>Thursday 26th May</h1>
        <p>A more gentle day. We didn't get up too early and the sun was shining, at least for a while. I finished off the May newsletter, submitting it twice for approval!</p>
        <p>Angela went to the paddock with Krista and Rowan to 'walk' the ponies and we went for a short walk with Flo after lunch. I spent a while playing a computer game with Rowan and we played Cluedo after dinner, which was barbecued burgers and sausages.</p>
