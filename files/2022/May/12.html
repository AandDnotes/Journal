        <h1>Thursday 12th May</h1>
        <p>The day started well, with a clear blue sky. Lester arrived early and we went off to Lyons Farm to get a photo printed and to fill the car with petrol. Then we went to Waitrose to shop before going on to Victoria Grand to see Dad.</p>
        <p>After lunch I downloaded the video files from Tuesday's talk and started putting something together. The sound from the camera was very low and the Zoom camera did not switch because the radio microphones were plugged into only one laptop.</p>
        <p>Just before dinner I felt a little dizzy which got worse afterwards. I had to sit down with my eyes closed for the rest of the evening and things seemed to improve. So the day did not end as well as it started.</p>
