        <h1>Sunday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I watered the grass and made a start on my May newsletter, but spent some time checking our travel documents following an email from BA. Hopefully we have the right set.</p>
        <p>We spoke to Paul during the afternoon. Beforehand, Angela made me two new masks, since I seem to have lost one of my original pair.</p>
