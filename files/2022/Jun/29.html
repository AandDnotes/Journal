        <h1>Wednesday 29th June</h1>
        <p>Dad's funeral. We heard on the radio that an accident had closed the A24, north-bound, between Findon and Washington, but we had a call from the funeral director to say that the police said it would be clear by 10:30, and it was. It was drizzling when we left home, but had stopped by the time we reached the crematorium. Everyone who was expected got there and the service was very good. Alan did well with both his 'memories' and reading the poem. We then all went to the Black Horse and had some lunch in the bowling alley. It was good to talk with Martin and Ros and the rest. We were home by about four o'clock.</p>
