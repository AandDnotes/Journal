        <h1>Wednesday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI group and, earlier than was really necessary, I drove into Worthing. I parked in Grand Avenue and caught the bus back to the library. Being early I stopped for a coffee, then went to the Registrar's office. I was seen early and left at the time my appointment was due to start, with four death certificates. On the way home I dropped the 'green form' in to the funeral directors.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Sam, the celebrant, called. We opened a Zoom call with Alan and talked through the programme. We told her the music we had chosen and later she sent some suggested readings for use if we have time.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we filled the car with stuff to take to the tip and I put together the photos and sent them to the funeral director and read the poems that Sam sent.</p>
