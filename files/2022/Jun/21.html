        <h1>Monday 21st June</h1>
        <p>It was a relatively early start today. Angela went to Storrington on the bus to bank her WI cash and I went to Hurstpierpoint for a whole day of fan boat building. I also gave two talks.</p>
        <p>It was a fine, sunny and warm day. Angela did a lot of work in the front garden.</p>
