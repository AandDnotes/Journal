        <h1>Monday 13th June</h1>
        <p>Angela spent most of the day cooking for the lunch club. I went down for my lunch.</p>
        <p>I started by doing some of the things associated with Dad's funeral and then fitted two of the posts of the front fence. I fitted a third post in the afternoon.</p>
        After a sandwich tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. I took the TC, driving home before it got too dark.
