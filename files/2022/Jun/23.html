        <h1>Thursday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. We started by taking a lot of stuff to the tip in Shoreham. Then we looked in both B&amp;Q and Next (Homebase Garden Centre) for a large, green water butt, but no luck. So we had coffee in M&amp;S before doing our weekly shop in Tesco.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Homebase in Portslade, but they had sold out of all their water butts. However, we called into Maybury garden centre and found just what we were looking for. Luckily it just fitted into the back of the car.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed the link to the Funeral Notice to everyone for whom I had email addresses. And I reviewed the order of service and the celebrants words.</p>
