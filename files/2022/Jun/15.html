        <h1>Wednesday 15th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went walking with her WI group, leaving before I was out of the bathroom. I paid the deposit to Dignity and emailed them about our choice of flowers. I also filled in the names of all those going to Menai Bridge, following an email from Sykes. Their web site says that they (Sykes) will automatically take the balance on the due date from the credit card used for the deposit.</p>
        <p>During the day I only put one and two thirds rows on the front fence. But I did pay for the WSMGOC barbecue.</p>
        <p>I went to see the doctor about the mark on my shoulder. She had planned to freeze it off. However, when she saw it was now an open wound she couldn't do it. So she referred me to the dermatology department at Worthing. I should get an appointment within two weeks.</p>
