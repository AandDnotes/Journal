        <h1>Sunday 19th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I checked the Panda's tyres and replied to the Chair of the Merseyside IET Network about our experience of running a hybrid event. I also put a couple of my 'study' paintings into frames. Later I collected together some photos of Dad and put them on our web site, sending Alan the link.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul, who has booked Eurostar for visiting here for Dad's funeral and flights to Manchester in August.</p>
