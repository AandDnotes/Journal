        <h1>Saturday 11th June</h1>
        <p>A mainly sunny, but breezy day. I spent most of the morning and part of the afternoon in the garage cutting the posts for the fence in front of the front door. The posts are 70mm by 70mm and one meter long. I need to cut 30cm in half, to fit against the wall. I started by cutting each side with the circular saw, which only cut to a depth of about two centimetres, and then cut through the remaining section with the jigsaw. This worked for the first post, but the jigsaw deviated underneath from the cut (which luckily was into the waste area) and the third post started doing the same. So I started cutting down the centre using a hand saw.</p>
        <p>Angela marked out a wider flower bed in the kitchen garden, lifted the turf and dug over the soil. She also cut the grass in the three gardens.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did the weekly accounts (we have a lot more transactions since we started using contactless), including reconciliation against the bank statement. During the afternoon we had a FaceTime call with Victoria and a Zoom call with Alan and Chris to go over some of the details of Dad's funeral. We seem to agree on most things. I had previously managed to contact Dad's friend Colin and I emailed Anthony.</p>
