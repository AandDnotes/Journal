        <h1>Thursday 30th June</h1>
        <p>We needed to buy a few things, so we all walked down to the High Street. I made an appointment for an eye test and Angela went to the Coop and the butchers. Then we went into Truffles for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took Paul to Shoreham station for him to start his journey home. I explored how to create a slide show and uploaded all the photos that were shown at Dad's funeral.</p>
