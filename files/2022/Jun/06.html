        <h1>Monday 6th June</h1>
        <p>I was picked up by Mike Wooldridge at nine o'clock and taken to Chichester Planetarium for an RCEA visit. We had an introduction from one of the volunteers and then went into the dome. They have the only optical star projector in the UK. It is 40 years old and there are only four of that type working in the world. They also have a digital star projector and several other projectors, so they showed video film of the planned Moon programme. Our visit started at 10:30 and finished at 12:30, so I was home at about 1:30.</p>
        <p>I had a call from Victoria Grand to say that they had been phoned by the local GP, who would be providing the death verification certificate. It was said that the doctor would call me, but hasn't so far.</p>
        <p>I phoned Barclays and checked that I could notify them about Dad's death without our joint account being frozen. So I notified them online and need to upload the death certificate and an identification document for me. I also looked up the very complex process for OakNorth Bank.</p>
        <p>Lester called to pick his corrugated sheets and pointed me at his Checkatrade entry. So I gave him a review.</p>
