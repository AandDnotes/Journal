        <h1>Sunday 5th June</h1>
        <p>Since it was the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, Angela went off to a service at St Andrews and then went to her street party lunch. I spent most of the morning searching for photos of Dad and posting a few on our shared photos site. At about midday I walked down to the High Street to take some photos, including some of Angela's table. Luckily it stayed dry, even if it was overcast and cool.</p>
        <p>We then spent most of the afternoon watching the Jubilee Pageant on the TV. It was quite entertaining. I video'd a couple of bits, including the giant dragon puppet and posted them. We also had a chat with Paul.</p>
