        <h1>Tuesday 14th June</h1>
        <p>It was a hot and sunny day. I had a session with the funeral director this morning. Various forms to sign and decisions to make. I agreed to record the live stream. After lunch I walked down to the High Street to get a haircut. Then I made and fitted the top rail of the front fence. I also put stain on it to see how it would look.</p>
        <p>Later I phoned Alan to give him an update and check what flowers they wanted.</p>
