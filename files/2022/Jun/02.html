        <h1>Thursday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>We set off fairly early to do the weekly shop. Our plan had been to shop in Sainsbury's (including a trip by me to B&amp;Q to get some masonry bits and look at drain covers), then go to the bank in Worthing to pay in a cheque before having coffee and going on to Victoria Grand. Then we planned a visit to a garden centre on the way home. However, we realised that the bank would be closed (it was the Spring bank holiday) and that Angela could probably get what she wanted in B&amp;Q.</p>
        <p>So we started by going into B&amp;Q and bought three bags of compost, four pannets of plants and a set of drill bits. Although marked as 'universal' the bits require a four-jaw chuck; my drill has three jaws!</p>
        <p>Time was pressing, so we went to Waitrose to shop and have coffee and then went to Victoria Grand. Dad was fine. We checked his shirts, which were fine, apart from the one that he was wearing. He doesn't seem to wear those hanging in his wardrobe. While there we watched the Jubilee fly-past.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the grass and did some tidying in the gardens (mainly the front garden). I checked over the TC and put the battery on charge, then answered a few email.</p>
