        <h1>Monday 27th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to her exercise group this morning and I spent some time trying to edit the Sussex home page, but I couldn't find a way to insert images. I also created a set of icons to use on the page.</p>
        <p>I researched cash ISAs and decided to put the remaining £20K from Angela's Nationwide ISA into a Paragon Bank 1yr ISA in my name.</p>
        <p>In the evening I chaired an IET Sussex committee meeting for the last time. So I spent some of the day earlier preparing for it.</p>
