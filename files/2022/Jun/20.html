        <h1>Monday 20th June</h1>
        <p>A busy day. I started by going to the Dermatology department at Southlands Hospital for someone to look at the spot on my shoulder. It seems that it is not cancerous. The doctor dressed it so that it will dry up and will cut it out in three to four weeks time. She checked my scalp, face, back, chest and lower legs. She will ask my GP to prescribe some cream in October for my scalp.</p>
        <p>My appointment was on time, so I was able to get home just as Angela was going to her exercise group. Then at midday I set off for Hurstpierpoint, to help with a 'fan boats' STEM session. Andrew and I supervised the making and testing of the boats with one class, and Mike and I gave talks to another. Andrew had given one earlier. I don't think my talk on submarines was very successful.</p>
        <p>I got home at four and Angela came home from her WI meeting half an hour later.</p>
