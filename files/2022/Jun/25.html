        <h1>Saturday 25th June</h1>
        <p>During our usual walk to the High Street on Saturday morning, we delivered a suitcase full of clothes and blankets to the Oxfam shop, Angela bought a newspaper and some eggs and I posted Dad's will to the probate office. When we got home I emailed suggested changes to the celebrant's words.</p>
        <p>Then is was time to update the weekly accounts, before moving a hose connector from the old water butt (to be replaced when it is empty) to one of the new, smaller butts in the walled garden. After lunch we spoke with Victoria. The children had been to 'playground camp' for three days, after breaking up from school for the summer holiday. Brandon had gone off to a brewing convention.</p>
