        <h1>Friday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>Both an interesting and a sad day. We spent the day at the SADCASE Classic Car event at Amberley Museum and Dad passed away.</p>
        <p>We arrived at Amberley in the TC earlier than expected, about 9:30, but there were already a lot of cars. We parked up with the other WSMGOC cars. During our walk around to view the cars, just before 11:30, I had a call from Caroline at Victoria Grand. Dad had complained of chest pains, so they called the paramedics who said he had erratic heart beats and a low blood pressure. They recommended going to hospital, be he didn't want to go. So the carers kept an eye on him and later found him slumped in his chair.</p>
        <p>Since he had not seen a doctor within the last two weeks, his death is classed as unexplained. So Victoria Grand had to inform the police. They asked a local undertakers to look after his body. I spoke to them later and we now just need to wait for the coroner's office to contact us. The only other thing I did, apart from contacting relatives, was to cancel his newspapers.</p>
        <p>I phoned Alan from Amberley, but the signal was not good. When we got home (about 3:30) I phoned Alan again, then emailed Victoria and Paul, phoned Aunt Joan and Beryl and emailed Anthony, Martin and John.</p>
