        <h1>Tuesday 7th June</h1>
        <p>I set off at 10:15 to Washington to meet up with the Eurotherm walking group. I parked by the Frankland Arms and walked to the car park near the the A24. The others went to the car park, but Angela said that it was notorious for thefts. We walked about five miles (Martin inadvertently cut a corner).</p>
        <p>The weather forecast said that the rain would pass by ten and then we would just have showers. It drizzled all morning and into the afternoon. By the time we got back to the Frankland Arms I was very wet. I didn't take waterproof trousers and my boots leaked! When I got home I had to completely change.</p>
        <p>No call from the doctor or coroner's office.</p>
