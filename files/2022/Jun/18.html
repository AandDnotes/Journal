        <h1>Saturday 18th June</h1>
        <p>I wasn't quite as hot today, being overcast for a lot of the day. We walked to the High Street to buy a few things. I forgot to take my wallet, but luckily there was enough on our Coop card to pay for the newspaper and eggs.</p>
        <p>At various times during the day I worked on installing two water butts in the walled garden. I just need an extra connector that I will salvage from the large, old water butt in the kitchen garden when I replace it.</p>
        <p>We had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick in the morning, arranging to visit them in August. We then had a FaceTime call with Victoria after lunch. Angela did some work in the garden and I did the weekly accounts.</p>
