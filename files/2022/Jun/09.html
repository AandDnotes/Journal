        <h1>Thursday 9th June</h1>
        <p>I started by phoning Dillistone Funeral Services and arranged to visit them later in the day. I had arranged to visit Victoria Grand, with Alan, to clear Dad's room. I called into B&amp;Q on the way to change the masonry bits that I bought last week and entered Victoria Grand after taking a lateral flow test. That was at 11 and Alan arrive half an hour later, having spent a long time on the M25.</p>
        <p>It was about one o'clock before we had everything in our two cars and brought it back home. After lunch we brought some of the items in and Alan took some photos and paintings. Then we went off to the undertakers to get an outline of what we needed to decide. Alan called into places in Findon where we could go after the funeral, but didn't get home until about eight o'clock.</p>
        <p>I had forgotten about my PEI meeting! An email from Mike Underhill reminded me and I sent out an invite. However, only Mike and Guy attended.</p>
