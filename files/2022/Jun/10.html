        <h1>Friday 10th June</h1>
        <p>The timber for our fence arrived quite early, while we were sorting out Dad's stuff. Unfortunately, the posts are considerably darker than the rails, so later I bought some timber stain that looks as though it will match the colour of the posts.</p>
        <p>After lunch we firstly went to Dunelm to buy two pillows, then to B&amp;Q to get the wood stain. While there we joined the B&amp;Q club so as to get 10% off the price. From there we went to M&amp;S. I bought some new socks and Angela looked for (but didn't find) gluten free mushroom soup. We then went into Tesco to get our groceries and for Angela to get food for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>It took us a long time to get home because there had been an accident by the cement works.</p>
        <p>When we got home I booked an appointment with the registrar to register Dad's death. However, the first appointment was not until June 21st! But I am at a STEM event that day, so I made an appointment on Wednesday 22nd.</p>
