        <h1>Sunday 12th June</h1>
        <p>It seems to have been a busy day. We showered and Angela went off to church. I finished making the posts for the front fence and gave one side of them a coat of stain/preservative. After lunch I gave the other side a coat.</p>
        <p>I sorted through another bag of Dad's clothes. They were ones that I thought were only fit for the recycling bin and I was right. Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. He still seems intent on coming over for Dad's funeral, even though he could view the live stream.</p>
        <p>Angela was busy in the garden and then made some 'bullet' biscuits after dinner. I phoned Dad's friend Paul this morning and Aunt Joan before dinner. She hopes to join online.</p>
