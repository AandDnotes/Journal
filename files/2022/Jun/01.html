        <h1>Wednesday 1st June</h1>
        <p>My seventy fourth birthday, but otherwise an uneventful day. Angela went off early with her WI walking group, so was out until lunchtime. I spent the morning replying to email and updating the accounts spreadsheet with revised direct debit figures.</p>
        <p>Lesters one and two arrived after lunch. They didn't have much to do, but they had they had hardly got started before we had a heavy shower. They now just have to finish clearing up and remove their corrugated sheets. So they will call on Monday afternoon. Lester one phoned later to tell us what the final price is.</p>
        <p>We found that the Post Office franchise was the cheapest place to buy the small water butts that we want, and there is no delivery charge. So we ordered two for the walled garden. They will take 3-5 working days, so we won't get them until next weekend.</p>
