        <h1>Thursday 16th June</h1>
        <p>It was a hot, sunny day. We started the day by going to Dunelm to get some net curtain and garden chair cushions, before going on to Holmebush. I bought some new summer trousers before we had coffee in M&S. Then we did the shopping in Tesco. For some reason I couldn't do anything right and the online order trolleys kept getting in the way.</p>
        <p>After lunch I continued work on the front fence. I now just have two pieces of the lowest rail to add. I also started looking at repairing the broken garden table.</p>
        <p>At six o'clock there was an CC-UK webinar on the subject of EngX. It did not get going until about 6:15, since the links did not work. It helped a little, but there are still problems from a local network point of view.</p>
        <p>After dinner we booked places at the WSMGOC June pub lunch and tickets  for the musical at Chichester in July.</p>
