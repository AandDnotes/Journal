        <h1>Tuesday 28th June</h1>
        <p>I started by ironing two pairs of trousers and our shirts for tomorrow. Aunt Joan's cheque for a charity donation arrived this morning. So I used the funeral notice web site to pay Â£30 into the BHF fund. Meanwhile, Angela gave Dad's suit to a charity shop, paid in the cheque in the Post Office and searched Steyning for some new tights, without success. I also answered some questions from Steve West.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the store in Beeding to get some tights, plus a few other things. We did buy an ice cream on the way home. While we were out I received a text message from Paul to say that he had got through security in Rotterdam and was waiting for the Eurostar train. We were expecting him at Shoreham at about ten o'clock, which he was. All three trains were on time!</p>
