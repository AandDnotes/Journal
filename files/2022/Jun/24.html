        <h1>Friday 24th June</h1>
        <p>The early part of the morning was spent reviewing the celebrants draft words before we set off in the TC for the 'pub run', getting some fuel on the way. We went to the Wheatsheaf at Plummers Plain. There were 24 WSMGOC members and we were sitting outside under a cover with a grape vine above. It was a little on the cool side, but we had the hood down both ways, doing a total of 31 miles.</p>
        <p>We were home by 3:15. I completed an application for probate and later I talked with Alan about his suggestions for modifying the celebrate's draft words.</p>
