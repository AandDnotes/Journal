        <h1>Wednesday 8th June</h1>
        <p>Angela set off with Felicity to their WI walking group at about 9:15 and David F-B arrived to pick me up at 9:30. Angela only went for a short walk before going to the Hub in Beeding. David drove me in his modern MG TF to Keymer, where we met up with the rest of the Sussex Wanderers for coffee. We set of on a 30-mile run to Selmeston for lunch. On the way back we stopped at a farm job to buy some bottles of cider. Although we had the hood down for most of the journey, we had some very heavy showers.</p>
        <p>Before leaving home I firstly had a call from Victoria Grand to ask if I had heard anything yet and then a call from the coroner's office to say that they have agreed that the doctor can sign the death certificate and the registrar's office will call me when the doctor's form reaches them and I can make an appointment to collect the death certificate. They also asked which funeral director we wanted to use. We will stick with Dillistone.</p>
        <p>Later I called Alan. He will come down tomorrow so that we can clear Dad's stuff from his room.</p>
