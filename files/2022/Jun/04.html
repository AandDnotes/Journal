        <h1>Saturday 4th June</h1>
        <p>A quieter day than yesterday. It started and ended with rain, but was fine in the middle. We walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. Then Angela worked in the garden while I did the weekly and monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria, but the children were playing outside. Prior to that I downloaded the recording of the last IET Sussex talk, edited it and uploaded it to YouTube. I still need to add it to our web page.</p>
