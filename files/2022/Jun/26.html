        <h1>Sunday 26th June</h1>
        <p>Angela was out for most of the day, the morning at church and then in the afternoon back at church to help provide refreshments as part of the 'open gardens day'.</p>
        <p>I did a couple of timed trials of my eulogy and emailed my thoughts about the Communications Officer's tasks to the Sussex committee. After lunch I cleaned my walking books and coated the fabric parts with water proofing liquid. Then I removed the turf from under the slabs that we had put in front of the garden store.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I spoke to Paul. We hope to see him on Tuesday evening.</p>
