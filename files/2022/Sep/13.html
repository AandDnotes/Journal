        <h1>Tuesday 13th September</h1>
        <p>It was a grey and rainy day. Angela went to the Hight Street and, after lunch, to a WI committee meeting.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the day in the garage. I centred the jets (only one needed centring), statically synchronised the carbs and then connected the chokes. It took quite a while to connect the slow running control, but now I'm ready to try to start the engine, do the dynamic synchronisation and adjust the mixture.</p>
