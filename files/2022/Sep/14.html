        <h1>Wednesday 14th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to catch the bus to Storrington to bank her lunch club cash. A few minutes later David F-B arrived in his V8 Rover P6 for us to go to Shoreham to meet the other Sussex Wanderers.</p>
        <p>After coffee and a chat we set off, in the rain, to Brooklands, up to the A27, a U-turn at Lyons Farm, over the Bostal, through Steyning, a loop through Wiston and back along the bypass to Bramber and Beeding. Then up through Small Dole, Blackstone and on to Bolney for lunch. David delivered me back home at about 3:30.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela had gone to table tennis, getting home at 4:30.</p>
