        <h1>Saturday 10th September</h1>
        <p>I'd hoped that my back would be a lot better today, after yesterday's improvement. However, it was initially worse, so Angela went to the High Street on her own.</p>
        <p>So I started by doing the weekly accounts. Then later the bank statement arrived! While Angela worked in the garden I went back into the garage. I spent part of the morning and part of the afternoon trying to adjust the fuel level in the front carburettor. I ended up where I had started!</p>
        <p>We spent an hour being talked to by Victoria, although Austin did tell us a little about school. However, he was more interested in telling us about a new game. Juniper was in a mood and would not talk to anyone.</p>
