        <h1>Thursday 8th September</h1>
        <p>This morning there was an announcement that the Queen was under medical supervision and that all her children were making their way to Balmoral. Just before dinner it was announced that she had died. So this week we not only have a new Prime Minister, but we have a new King.</p>
        <p>We started by going to Dunelm to pick up some vertical blind weights that I had ordered online. We also called into B&Q (but they had no plants that Angela wanted), shopped in Lidle, had coffee in M&amp;S, finished the shopping in Tesco and filled the Panda with petrol. Angela drove, since my back is still troublesome.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, between showers, Angela continued to work in the garden. I assembled the rear carburettor, not needing to worry about the rain in the garage.</p>
