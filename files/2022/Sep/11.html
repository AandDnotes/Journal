        <h1>Sunday 11th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I reconciled the bank statement against my spreadsheet. It took a little while to establish that I had, in fact, paid the Dartford Crossing toll. I'd used the credit card, since I paid it online.</p>
        <p>Once again Angela spent time in the garden and, apart from talking to Paul et al, I spent most of the time in the garage, trying to set the fuel level. Although I can't blow through the fuel inlet (in other words, the needle valve seems to work), the fuel pump continues to slowly 'tick' and the fuel level in the jet gradually rises. I will probably go back to the traditional approach to tuning, at least for now.</p>
        <p>Krista and Paul invited us there for Christmas. It seems that someone had booked their cottage over Christmas and the New Year, but have cancelled, so they seem to want us to use it.</p>
