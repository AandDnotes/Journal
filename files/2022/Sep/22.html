        <h1>Thursday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>I started with some parts of my IET actions, then while Angela went to the dentist for a checkup and to see the hygienist, I took the TC for another test run; just my figure of eight route. The engine was running much better, but I still have fuel leaks.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to B&amp;Q, Lidle and M&S. Angela bought a small propagator from the former and trousers, pyjamas and food (items that we couldn't find at Lidl) from the latter.</p>
        <p>I finished off with more IET email and modifications to Ramon's draft of a blog on STEM activities.</p>
