        <h1>Sunday 18th September</h1>
        <p>I was up during the night being sick and didn't get a lot of sleep. I felt a little fragile (and tired) during the morning, but felt better after lunch. Also, my back continues to improve.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to church and stayed out for lunch. Meanwhile I wrote up some notes from Thursday's PEI meeting and then tried to have a nap in the chair. That didn't work. So after some lunch I went into the garage to continue trying to set up the carburettors. I made a first attempt at balancing them by adjusting the linkage between them. I also got the slow running cable connected. I couldn't get the idle speed lower than 1000 rpm (the aim is 700-800).</p>
        <p>Then we spoke with Paul before cooking dinner.</p>
