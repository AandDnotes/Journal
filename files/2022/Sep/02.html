        <h1>Friday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>Although we were a little late getting up, we spent the whole morning at garden centres. We firstly went to Squires, to look at plants and prices, then went on to Old Barn for coffee and to buy various plants and two troughs. We will go back to Squires to buy some plants from them.</p>
        <p>Angela then went round to Gwen's and then worked in the garden. I searched for photos of the cottage and then started scanning them in. However, the iMac kept loosing communications with the printer/scanner.</p>
        <p>I also had an email from James at Burlen to say that he would finish putting inserts into my carburettor bodies today and they will be sent out on Monday.</p>
