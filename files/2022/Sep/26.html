        <h1>Monday 26th September</h1>
        <p>I spent most of the day in front of a computer. Angela went off to her exercise group, pinning up her coffee morning posters en route. After lunch she did some more work in the garden.</p>
        <p>Ramon was having problems with his Education Officer blog page, so I test a few things, which involved using the Linux and Windows systems. So I updated them in the process.</p>
        <p>I also started preparing for a drawing of the plan of the cottage.</p>
