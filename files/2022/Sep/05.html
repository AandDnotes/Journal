        <h1>Monday 5th September</h1>
        <p>At about 1:30 this morning I was woken and thought that it was morning, since it was light. I soon realised that it was several lightening flashes each second, a continuous roar of thunder and rain lashing against the window. Also, the internal bedroom door was rattling. When I looked out of the window, Phil seemed to be rescuing his 'sail'. It wasn't a good night's sleep.</p>
        <p>When we got up we found that the doors of the garden store had opened and everything inside had got wet! So Angela started by emptying the store to let it dry. She then went to her 'exercise' group while I dealt with a few IET related email.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela continued working in the garden and I fitted some wires to the wall for a new plant to grow up. We also spoke with Victoria. It is a bank holiday in the US and they arrived home yesterday having visited Carol and picking up the children.</p>
