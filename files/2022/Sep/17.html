        <h1>Saturday 17th September</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. It was noticeably colder today, although it was mainly sunny. At 5:30 this morning Angela got up and discovered that the radiators were warm. I must have set the heating to manual (instead of off) when we turned it on after our trip to Wales. Last night was probably the cold enough to make it turn on.</p>
        <p>Angela then planted more plants and I did the weekly accounts. I also started crafting an email of notes from our PEI meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. She couldn't get the children to talk with us. Then Angela was back in the garden and I completed my new slow-running bracket, modifying my design so that the cable is above the fixing point. I fitted it, but need to connect the cable. However, it looks as though it allows me to keep the lever away from the throttle linkage.</p>
