        <h1>Saturday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>Another morning spent shopping. We walked to the Steyning market and then went off to Squires garden centre to buy the plants that Angela saw yesterday. That took a while, but we then thought we would pick some plumbs at Spring Gardens. We started with coffee and then walked around, but couldn't find any Victoria plumbs.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, Angela then spent most of the afternoon in the garden. Meanwhile I did the weekly and the monthly account before reading some of the day's newspaper. Then I started putting together a web site on the cottage as part of my 'Reminiscences of an Ordinary Man' site.</p>
