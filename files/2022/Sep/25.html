        <h1>Sunday 25th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I updated the iMac (which took all morning), made posts to Twitter and LinkedIn and emailed a committee member about taking over those two accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and later spoke with Paul. Otherwise there was quite a lot of newspaper reading.</p>
