        <h1>Tuesday 6th September</h1>
        <p>First thing this morning Angela bought up half the butchers shop. Meanwhile, I transferred money to Burlen for the repair of the carburettor bodies and dealt with a few IET related email, including sending out an invite to members of the PEI group. I also refitted the plastic shelves in the garden store and move a few things back in. Angela moved the rest in later in the day.</p>
        <p>After a little bit of a search I found the file on the cottage. It was on the shelf where I expected it to be, but I had initially overlooked it. Angela continued to plant her collection of plants.</p>
