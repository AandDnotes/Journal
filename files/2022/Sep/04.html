        <h1>Sunday 4th September</h1>
        <p>We set off at 8:30 for Whiteways Lodge to help at the start of the South Downs Run. With the TC's carburettor bodies not expected until Tuesday at the earliest, we were in the Panda and so did not take part in the run to Eastbourne. So we helped dismantle the entrance and gazebo and then got home just after twelve.</p>
        <p>Angela did some more work in the garden and I cat some dead wood out of a bush on the front. Then I fixed a cupboard door knob that kept working loose.</p>
        <p>Later we had a chat with Paul.</p>
