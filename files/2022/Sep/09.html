        <h1>Friday 9th September</h1>
        <p>Today the media was all about the death of the Queen and the ceremony associated with the instantiation of a new monarch.</p>
        <p>Again Angela worked in the garden and I worked in the garage. I rebuilt the front carburettor and fitted it to the engine. At least, like the rear carburettor, I did not install the piston and it cover, since I need to set the (or at least check) the fuel level. When connecting the throttles I ensured that both butterflies were fully closed when I tightened the connector.</p>
        <p>It seems to take me longer and longer to complete my two daily Dutch lessons.</p>
