        <h1>Thursday 15th September</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop (and get a photo printed), before going on to Findon Garden Centre (mainly for coffee) and then to Squires.</p>
        <p>Since the long spring on the accelerator linkage was rubbing on the link between the two carbs, I reversed the body bracket and added a 'solder tag' to the top fitting. I also did some adjustments to the slow running connection to the carburettors and then started the engine. However, I couldn't get the revs low enough. I think the slow running control is stopping this, so I started making a new bracket for holding the cable.</p>
        <p>Only two people joined my PEI Group meeting!</p>
