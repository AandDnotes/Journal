        <h1>Saturday 24th September</h1>
        <p>I started with a walk to the newsagents to buy a paper as Angela prepared herself for a drive to Petworth to meet Carol and June. Once she had gone I did the weekly accounts and finished entering the events into my new blog page. However, before I could add other items, the system said that the blog had to be reviewed and removed my access!</p>
        <p>So I went into the garage to 'play' with the carburettors on the TC. I removed the fuel feed banjo bolt on the front carb after having some difficulty. I had used thread-lock on both carbs. In fact, I couldn't undo the bolt on the rear carb. I removed the top of the float chamber on both carbs and removed/checked the needle valves. I could not see any wear and a 'blow' test was positive. There was still fuel leaking from the rear jet, so I tightened the main jet nut. Otherwise, the fuel levels seemed fine, although the fuel pump still ticks every few seconds.</p>
        <p>Angela got home at about 4:30 after a good day out.</p>
