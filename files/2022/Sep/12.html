        <h1>Monday 12th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off at about eleven to help with today's lunch club. I worked in the garage, setting the fuel level in the front carburettor and then in the rear device using the conventional approach. I then walked down to the Methodist church for lunch.</p>
        <p>I got home in time for my meeting with Steve West. However, did not have access into Adestra and the iMac 'froze' apart from the MS Teams video! I had to hard boot it. So we went through the process and agreed that we would proceed via email.</p>
        <p>In the early evening I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington.</p>
