        <h1>Thursday 29th September</h1>
        <p>We spent the whole morning (after Angela hung out some washing) do our weekly grocery shop. We started at Lidl, went to M&amp;S for coffee and then into Tesco to get the few things that we couldn't find in Lidl.</p>
        <p>After lunch I booked the Panda in for a service and MoT, replied to questions on the convenor's guide and spent half an hour talking to someone from Virgin Media. With any luck our move from TalkTalk will now take place at the end of our contract. We can only wait to see what happens.</p>
        <p>I also created a template for a 'start' slide for our in-person talks. After dinner we decided that it was too cold and turned on the central heating. We had intended waiting until October (just two days away), but it made a big difference.</p>
