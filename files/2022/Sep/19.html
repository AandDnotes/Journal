        <h1>Monday 19th September</h1>
        <p>We spent a lot of time in front of the television today. It was, after all, the funeral of the late Queen.</p>
        <p>Before it event started, Angela made a batch of carrot cake buns. Later in the afternoon I continued tuning the carburettors on the TC. I adjusted the synchronisation and moved the mixture a couple of flats. It seemed to be running well, although it's slowest idle is still about 100 rpm.</p>
