        <h1>Tuesday 20th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to a WI/tree group meeting about the WI planting a tree for the Queen's Jubilee. She also called in the library and got home just before lunch. Meanwhile, I called into the pharmacy to pick up my repeat prescription.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA AGM/talk at Field Place. It was a quite interesting talk about the history of a railway locomotive works. He was a good speaker and used just photos of various parts of the works over time.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined (late) the IET Sussex committee meeting.</p>
