        <h1>Friday 16th September</h1>
        <p>We spent most of the day in Horsham (or traveling to and from it). Angela had an appointment for a health check and so we drove up to the 'park &amp; ride' and then caught the bus into the centre. After a little walk around and a coffee, Angela went for her appointment and I walked some more and then went into the library. I read some parts of travel books about New Jersey. I don't think I learnt a lot.</p>
        <p>Luckily Angela was finished sooner than expected and so we had another wander around the centre of Horsham and then had lunch in Dunelm. Then it was a case of wending our way home. I dropped Angela off, so that she could go to the church to help Sandy, and got home at three o'clock. The rest of the day was spent catching up on things, so I didn't make any progress on the TC.</p>
