        <h1>Wednesday 7th September</h1>
        <p>My lower back was feeling stiff last night and this morning it was worse. I don't know how I did it, but it means that getting from a sitting to a standing position (and vice versa) has been difficult.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning writing and dealing with IET-related email. Angela did not go walking, since she was playing table tennis after lunch, so she worked in the garden. Later in the morning my carburettor bodies arrived, complete with new threads.</p>
        <p>While Angela was at table tennis I prepared space on the bench for working on the carburettors and cut up the DHL box for Angela to use in her hot bin. Then later I started taking apart one of the jet assemblies, but found that I could not undo the jet adjusting nut. The lower part of the jet bearing, on to which the nut screws, simply turns, since it is not clamped in the carburettor body. The same nut on the other jet assembly does turn. So I didn't get very far. Luckily, standing up does not hurt my back. I've tried using the heated cherry stones, but it hasn't made any difference.</p>
