        <h1>Tuesday 27th September</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning on IET matters and Angela pooped to the High Street.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was interesting and, towards the end, frustrating. The Virgin man called at around three thirty to finish the installation of the broadband connection. He said that the brown box should have been installed where the coaxial cable was due to come through the house wall. However, he ran the cable right around the house and fitted the box next to the existing box. Unfortunately, the router is just too tall to fit in the space where the existing router sits.</p>
        <p>He was finished by about 4:30 and I had connected the MacBook Air to the new wifi. I need to check that Virgin move our land line number when the TalkTalk service ends. The telephone can then be plugged into the new router.</p>
        <p>I then spent the rest of the afternoon moving each device over to the new wifi. They all moved easily until the last one, the Chromecast. I eventually did a factory reset, but nothing seems to be able to find it via Bluetooth.</p>
        <p>Finally, TalkTalk emailed to tell me the cost of breaking my contract!</p>
