        <h1>Thursday 1st September</h1>
        <p>The first day of meteorological Autumn. It was warm and humid, with a thunder storm in the evening (that interrupted the TV signal). We spent all morning shopping. After the window cleaner called we went off to Tesco/Dunelm/B&Q/Lidl/Tesco, with limited success.</p>
        <p>After lunch we did bits and pieces, like finishing some writing. My second carburettor gasket set arrived, so I put the cork seals to soak in oil.</p>
