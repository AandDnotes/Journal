        <h1>Wednesday 28th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela worked in the garden, I started by checking the speed of the new internet connection (120 Mb/s down and 10 Mb/s down) and then set the wifi security to a higher level. I also sent a text to 'Donald' asking him to correct the date of the move. Just before dinner I tried making a complaint, but could only talk to a 'bot'.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I took the TC for a test run, up to Partridge Green and back down through Henfield (17 miles). At Partridge Green I stopped and raised the carburettor mixture control by one flat. It ran noticeably better. After lunch i checked for fuel leaks and tightened the fold-up bolts.</p>
        <p>Attempts to get the Chromecast working failed again. Although the MacBook and the iPad could 'see' each other via Bluetooth, neither could see the Chromecast, even after resetting it.</p>
