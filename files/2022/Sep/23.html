        <h1>Friday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>It was a wet morning, but dried and brightened a little before lunch. I spent a lot of the day working on IET related matters; emails and a pdf version of the talks programme (by creating a pages document). Then I started creating a blog page to contain the same information. You can save the blog page as a draft, but you then can't view it and therefore edit it. You have to ask the EngX support to send you a link to the blog!</p>
        <p>Angela potted up some cuttings and put them in her windowsill propagators. She also popped to the High Street to get some extra ingredients for dinner.</p>
