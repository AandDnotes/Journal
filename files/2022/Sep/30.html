        <h1>Friday 30th September</h1>
        <p>The day started sunny and finished wet. We set off fairly early to set up the coffee morning at the Methodist church. I set up the tables and put up the bunting. Once they were open I walked home to deal with email and then went back for coffee and cake. I chose the wrong cake; it was a bit hard. Then I went for a little walk before helping to put everything away. We were home just in time to have lunch.</p>
        <p>I tried again to get the Chromecast working, but still couldn't get anything (even my phone) to find it.</p>
