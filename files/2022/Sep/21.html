        <h1>Wednesday 21st September</h1>
        <p>After sending a few IET related email (following up my actions from Tuesday) I took the TC for a 20 mile test run. The engine seems to be stuttering during deceleration, most noticeably when going slowly. Meanwhile, Angela did some housework. Then, while Angela was at table tennis during the afternoon I removed the spark plugs. They indicated that the fuel mixture was too rich, but at least all the plugs were consistently black. So I raised the mixture control nuts by one flat.</p>
        <p>Later I cut the grass, front and back, and did some more IET work.</p>
