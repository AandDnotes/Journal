        <h1>Friday 8th July</h1>
        <p>It was a hot day, reaching 25 degrees after lunch. We walked down to Steyning. Angela went to the library and the butchers and I went to the health centre to give a blood sample. My PSA level is to be tested and the results should be available Monday or Tuesday.</p>
        <p>I then fixed up the sail sun shade. This included two eye splices. It all worked well, but by three o'clock it gives very little shade. I also put some more sand under one of the slabs in front of the garden store in an attempt to stop it rocking.</p>
