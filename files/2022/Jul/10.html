        <h1>Sunday 10th July</h1>
        <p>We set off for Chichester just after eleven and found the traffic to be heavier than we expected. We were not the last to arrive, but close. We then spent a couple of hours going up and down the canal, eating fish and chips on the way. It was another hot day, but there was a good breeze on the boat.</p>
        <p>We got home at four, but found that Paul et al had gone to a barbecue at a neighbour's house. So it was about seven before we had a chat with him.</p>
