        <h1>Saturday 16th July</h1>
        <p>Not a great deal happened today. It was sunny from dawn to dusk, so we walked to the High Street early, before it got too hot. We bought a few things in the Coop, including a newspaper. So quite a lot of time was spent reading it.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the statement. I also received details of what Alan paid for the buffet at Dad's funeral, so moved that amount into his account from Dad's account.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was quiet, until we spoke with Victoria. Austin had a good week at 'inventor camp' and both he and Juniper had bought suitcases for their holiday. Before that we booked a table at a pub in Chichester before going to the musical at Chichester Theatre.</p>
        <p>For dinner, Angela cooked an interesting flaky pastry cheese and tomato quiche.</p>
