        <h1>Thursday 14th July</h1>
        <p>Angela had a dentist appointment this morning, so we walked down to the Steyning Centre to vote on the Steyning Neighbourhood plan. I went to buy some rolls and Angela went to the dentist to have her new crown fitted. She was back early, so we went off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. I went to Argos to buy an air bed (and pump) and Angela started the grocery shop. We were home in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I emailed Victoria Grand and booked the hotel at Stourbridge for our journey to Menai Bridge. I also finished looking through Dad's photos and scanned in a couple more.</p>
