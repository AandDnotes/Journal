        <h1>Saturday 9th July</h1>
        <p>Another warm day. Even though there was cloud during the morning, the temperature reached 26 degrees and became very sunny. We started with a walk to the High Street to buy some rolls and a newspaper.</p>
        <p>Then I did the weekly accounts and finished by outline drawing of an SU carburettor. Later we spoke with Victoria. Austin was busy playing a computer game and Juniper was waiting to play.</p>
        <p>I also spent quite a long time trying to get iCloud Drive to update on the iMac. Some time after logging off and on again (which took a long time) it suddenly updated!</p>
