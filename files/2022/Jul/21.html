        <h1>Thursday 21st July</h1>
        <p>We started the day by loading the back of the car with stuff for the tip. Then we kept our appointment at the Shoreham tip, before going on to Dunelm to buy single duvet covers for Austin and Juniper's beds. After coffee it was off to Holmbush, firstly into M&S and then into Tesco. We got home just before one.</p>
        <p>Later Angela made a batch of biscuits and I read and pottered.</p>
