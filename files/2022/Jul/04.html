        <h1>Monday 4th July</h1>
        <p>US Independence Day. So Victoria et al have a day holiday. Angela went to her exercise group and I scanned in some of Dad's photos. Then I completed the British Aerospace pension form, which I took to the Post Office after lunch. I also updated a couple of the family history web pages.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I 'brushed off' the non-grass weeds on the drive, at least those up to the front of the garage. I now need to burn off the grass.</p>
