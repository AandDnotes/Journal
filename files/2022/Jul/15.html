        <h1>Friday 15th July</h1>
        <p>My main activity today was to replace the mould-ridden sealant in main bathroom shower. Actually it was only along half of the rear wall of the cubicle; I had replaced the other half some time ago and that seems to have worked. So before lunch I removed the old silicone, which was easier than I'd expected, probably because the mould was preventing it from sticking to the shower base. I then cleaned it (twice) with mould remover and left it to dry until after lunch. Then I put in a layer of white silicone and left it to set until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In between and afterwards I scanned more photos and added them to web pages; Angela had her hair cut and pottered in the garden. It was a fine, sunny day, although not as hot as yesterday. Angela also sorted out bedding for the expected whirlwind of visitors and we cleared the area of the sitting room that we will use as a dining area.</p>
