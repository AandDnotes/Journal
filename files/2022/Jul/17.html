        <h1>Sunday 17th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I drove to B&amp;Q to buy some transparent silicone sealant. I also filled the Panda with petrol. When I got home I finished off replacing the sealant along the back of the shower tray. I also read some of yesterday's paper and then framed one of my 'travel' paintings. After lunch I hung four (those framed) in the study.</p>
        <p>Otherwise we had a quiet afternoon, talking to Paul a little later than usual. Although I also started collecting photos of me and added a little to my article on carburettor tuning.</p>
