        <h1>Wednesday 27th July</h1>
        <p>We were the first up this morning, so we had breakfast before they got up. A little later we went off to Littlehampton. We had a picnic lunch near the beach and then Brandon and Juniper had a paddle. Then, while the children used a playground, Brandon, Victoria and I went to the car hire shop and had Brandon registered as an additional driver.</p>
        <p>Later we had a FaceTime call with Paul and Rowan.</p>
