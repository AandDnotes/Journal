        <h1>Tuesday 12th July</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela popped down to the High Street while I tidied the photos that I had scanned yesterday. Then we moved the pile of soil in the corner of the walled garden so that I could install the water feature. Before lunch I only got as far as fixing the solar panel to the wall.</p>
        <p>Then, while Angela went to her WI committee meeting. I installed the rest, but the pump would not work, even though the solar cell was delivering 7.25 volts. The pump says it needs 4-12V, so although it was overcast, the pump should have run. Unfortunately we have shredded the receipt from Squires! Nevertheless I emailed the manufacturer.</p>
