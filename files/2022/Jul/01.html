        <h1>Friday 1st July</h1>
        <p>We were up early because we were expecting the boiler to be serviced any time from eight o'clock to one. Two British Gas service men arrived at about 9:30, so we were able to go off to do the weekly shop by 10:30.</p>
        <p>We had not heard anything from Paul. It seems that the Eurostar train was delayed by 70 minutes and so he did not get home until 12:30.</p>
        <p>After coffee and a short shop (Angela had only a short list this week) we were home by lunchtime. So the afternoon was spent in the garden. I fixed the leaks from the joints on the water butts in the walled garden and then installed the new big butt in the kitchen garden. This meant levelling the slab beneath the butt, so I also put some sand beneath the slabs in front of the garden store.</p>
        <p>At various times I worked on an updated blog page listing our committee members.</p>
