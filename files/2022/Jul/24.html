        <h1>Sunday 24th July</h1>
        <p>A warm, mainly sunny, but breezy day. While Angela went to church I did more preparation for out trip, mainly in the form of printing parts of maps and checking parts of our route. I did investigate Mountain Road on StreetView and saw a cottage devoid of its exteria rendering. Also, the cottage next door has been built up to two stories.</p>
        <p>As soon as Angela got home so we set off to Lyminster for the WSMGOC barbecue. We went in the Panda, since we were late and wouldn't be able to park on Fran and David's drive. A pity, since it would have been a good day for a drive in the TC.</p>
        <p>It was a good outing and when we got home we spoke with Paul and Rowan. He has been (and is still) unwell, so we hope that he recovers before the end of the week.</p>
