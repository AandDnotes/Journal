        <h1>Monday 11th July</h1>
        <p>Another, even hotter day. Angela went off early to start helping with the lunch club. I dealt with some IET email and checked the TC carburettor joints, then went down to the lunch club for lunch.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I scanned in a number of photos from Dad's collection and updated some web pages. Then, after tea, I took the TC to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. There were a lot of MGs there and mine came second in 'the car that you would like to take home' competition. David Wright's MGA came first. The car ran well, although there was still a smell of petrol, both at Washington and when I got home.</p>
