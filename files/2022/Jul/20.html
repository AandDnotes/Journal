        <h1>Wednesday 20th July</h1>
        <p>It was considerably cooler, with a little (but only a little) rain overnight. The temperature only reached about 25 degrees outside and 27 inside. While Angela went off walking with her WI group I replied to some email and book an appointment for tomorrow at the tip. I also checked the cars over.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we drove over to Chichester, firstly to have dinner in the Bell Inn and then to see 'Crazy for You' at Chichester Theatre. We had the cheapest seats, on the side, but still had a good view. It was a very good production and very enjoyable. We left the theatre at about 10:30 and were home by 11:20.</p>
