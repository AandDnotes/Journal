        <h1>Thursday 28th July</h1>
        <p>Once again we were the only ones up early this morning. Before an early lunch Angela and I went down to the High Street to buy a few things.</p>
        <p>After lunch we drove down to Shoreham and walked by the house boats, then across the glass footbridge and back to the playground behind the recreation ground car park.</p>
        <p>After an enormous salad we packed up for the morning. Although we don't need to leave until ten, that is likely to be quite a struggle. Last night the children were still talking when we went to bed (and well after Victoria and Brandon went to bed). It sounds as though that will be repeated tonight.</p>
