        <h1>Tuesday 19th July</h1>
        <p>According to our outside thermometer, by 8:30 it was 29 degrees. It was 25 degrees inside, so we couldn't cool it down any more. We closed the windows and drew curtains on the sunny side. The outside temperature reached 32 degrees and it was very calm. Some places in the UK reached over 40 degrees, so it was the hottest ever recorded in the UK. Here it had clouded over by about six and it started to rain; just a few spots. It also became very windy. We took the sail down just in time. There was a little more rain during the evening.</p>
        <p>While it was still relatively cool (25 degrees inside) we did some furniture rearrangement. We moved the dining table into the sitting room, brought down two kitchen chairs from the left and moved the Z-bed from the study to the dining room. We also pumped up the airbed in the dining room. The afternoon was mainly spent reading.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I had a Teams call with Steve and Shanir about the Sussex Network's budget.</p>
