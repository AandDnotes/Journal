        <h1>Tuesday 5th July</h1>
        <p>Today I was due to join the Eurotherm walking group on a trek from Fletchers Croft to Chanctonbury and back. However, only two of us signed up for the walk, so it was cancelled. It was a fine day, so Angela and I caught the bus to Parham, walked through the park and then on to the RSPB reserve at Pulborough Brooks. We had just missed the bus, so we spent some time drinking coffee and looking at the view. It was half past one before we got home after buying a few things in the High Street.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was a case of catching up with email. I also downloaded the recording of Dad's funeral service, viewed small bits of it and looked through a few more of Dad's photo albums.</p>
