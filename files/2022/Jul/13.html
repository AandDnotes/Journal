        <h1>Wednesday 13th July</h1>
        <p>Another hot day. The temperature certainly reached 28 degrees. Angela went off early with her WI walking group, but they didn't over-stress themselves. I spent most of the morning adding photos and files to some of our 'family' web pages. We also discovered that the water feature pump did work if the sun was shining directly on the solar panel. Later in the day, when the panel was in the shade, it stopped. So I moved the panel down into the flower bed.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I went off to Southlands hospital have the 'spot' on my shoulder removed. From leaving home to getting back only took one and a quarter hours. I need to arrange to have the stitches removed in 12 days (the day before Victoria et al arrive and the day that we collect the hire car).</p>
        <p>At about 6:30 we had a power cut, apparently due to a fault in an underground cable. UK Power Networks sent us update texts and the power came back on just before 8:30. I am trying to recover the bread that I was making.</p>
