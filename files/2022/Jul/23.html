        <h1>Saturday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>Angela followed the usual walk to the High Street with a spell at a coffee morning at the Methodist Church. I did the weekly accounts and then charged/changed batteries in phones/cameras that we are taking with us to Wales.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria later. They seem to be all prepared for their journey here. Then I cut the grass (actually removed the seed stalks and taller weeds).</p>
