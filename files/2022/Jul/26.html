        <h1>Tuesday 26th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street while I fitted the child seats in teh car. I had to change things around a bit, since the middle seat is narrower than the rest.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning, after their plane had landed, we set off for Gatwick. They sent us messages just before we arrived to say that they had their bags and were waiting for us. Unfortunately we seem to have left Juniper's backpack where they were sitting! We have registered it as lost and will wait to see if they find it.</p>
        <p>They had eaten lunch, so we went for a walk to the cricket field. Then dinner and an early night, at least for Victoria and Brandon.</p>
