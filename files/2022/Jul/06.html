        <h1>Wednesday 6th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI group before I had left the bathroom. Then I transferred some cash into Dad's current account from his savings account, so that there is money there to pay the funeral director.</p>
        <p>I then spent most of the rest of the day working on the TC. The fuel consumption is too high and some of the plugs are sooty. A thread on the mg-abc forum has suggested a different approach to tuning SU carburettors. So I'm giving it a try. It is all about the level of the jet below the bridge and the fuel level in the jet (and therefore in the float chamber). I think I've set the front carburettor, but I'm having difficulty getting the level set on the rear one.</p>
