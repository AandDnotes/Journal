        <h1>Monday 25th July</h1>
        <p>We have now done all we can in preparation for our visitors and trip to Wales. This afternoon we collected the car from Littlehampton. It is a Renault Scenic, diesel with six gears (a heavy clutch) and not much luggage space. However, by folding one of the rear seats into the floor (there are three in the middle and two at the back) we should have enough space. it is a 2016 car and has done 84,000 miles, but seems comfortable. I now need to work out how to work all the controls.</p>
        <p>This morning I went to the health centre and had my stitches removed. All seems to be well. Then after lunch Angela went to give blood. I was about to go down to meet her when she arrived home. They would not take her blood this time, so we were able to go to Littlehampton a little earlier than we expected.</p>
