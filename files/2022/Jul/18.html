        <h1>Monday 18th July</h1>
        <p>Our outdoor thermometer registered 31 degrees today! Consequently we opened all the windows early and then closed them and drew the sun-facing curtains when the temperature outside reached that inside.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting, but otherwise we did not do a lot, other than sit around.</p>
