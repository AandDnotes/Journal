        <h1>Saturday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>We started, as we often do on Saturday, by going to the newsagents in the High Street. Today, however, it was market day, so we took some recycling with us. Then it was time to do the weekly and the monthly accounts (which I almost completed).</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to the St Barnabas garden party in Goring Road. Luckily the weather was fine, even if a bit breeze. I had both scones (with jam and cream) and a piece of ginger cake, as well as two cups of tea. Also, Angela won a raffle prize; a bottle of 'wine-based drink'.</p>
        <p>Victoria called just as we were starting dinner.</p>
