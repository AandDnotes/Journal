        <h1>Saturday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>We started, as we often do on Saturday, by going to the newsagents in the High Street. Today, however, it was market day, so we took some recycling with us. Then it was time to do the weekly and the monthly accounts (which I almost completed).</p>
        <p>We saw a rat in the kitchen garden. It looked like quite a healthy rat that ran back and forth along the back border and sat preening itself for a while. There was a hole into the twitten at the bottom of the trench dug by the builders by the garage wall. Later I blocked it with some flints and stone.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to the St Barnabas garden party in Goring Road. Luckily the weather was fine, even if a bit breeze. I had both scones (with jam and cream) and a piece of ginger cake, as well as two cups of tea. Also, Angela won a raffle prize; a bottle of 'wine-based drink'.</p>
        <p>Victoria called just as we were starting dinner.</p>
