        <h1>Thursday 7th July</h1>
        <p>We set off this morning at about 9:30 to do the weekly supermarket shop. Angela went into Sainsbury's while I went into B&amp;Q to buy a sun sail and the bits to fit it. We then went on to Findon Garden Centre for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I finished adjusting the carburettors, followed by a test run around my 'figure of eight' route. The engine ran well, but we now need to see what happens to the spark plugs and to the fuel consumption.</p>
