        <h1>Saturday 30th July</h1>
        <p>I drove today. We set off from Stourbridge just before ten, made a brief stop at some services on the A5 and then stopped for lunch at Corwen. We had tried to stop at Llangollan, but the car park was full.</p>
        <p>From there it was a twisty run through Betws-e-Coed and Bethesda to a garden centre outside Bangor for a cup of tea and to wait until we could get into the house at Menai Bridge. There was a little rain on the way. We arrived at about 4:30 and then went off to Waitrose to get something for breakfast. We found that the local pub was fully booked, so we went back to Waitrose to buy some pizzas, salad and fruit.</p>
