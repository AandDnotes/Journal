        <h1>Friday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash. I walked down to the High Street with her and on to the health centre to collect my repeat prescription. I bought some fruit juice and a bottle of 'Long Man' brewery beer.</p>
        <p>After Angela got home I fixed our garden clock to the wall in the 'walled garden'. The number four is missing and the number three had a broken section, which I glued. We had a fairly heavy shower of rain, that lasted long enough to nearly fill the water butts. Later I had to clear the gutters.</p>
