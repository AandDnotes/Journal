        <h1>Friday 29th July</h1>
        <p>We were a little earlier than planned and set off at about 9:30. We reached Runneymede just before midday, after taking a wrong turn after leaving the M25. However, we found it, had lunch in the NT cafe and walked to the Magna Cater memorial and the JFK memorial, as well as looking at some art installations.</p>
        <p>Rather than returning to the M25, Brandon used Google Maps to find a route that took us north to the M40 and then on to Stourbridge. We were all nervous wrecks by the time that we got there. He drove too fast and too close to vehicles in front.</p>
        <p>The Premier Inn was fine and after taking a walk into the town centre we had dinner in a Turkish restaurant that was very good.</p>
