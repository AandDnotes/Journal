        <h1>Sunday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I finished the monthly accounts and looked up some dividend payments. Then I cleared the IET actions from Monday's committee meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke briefly with Paul and Rowan. She had taken part in the first (of four) performance of her school musical. Then I completed the Civil Service Pension form and emailed it with a number of attachments.</p>
        <p>After dinner we worked through a number of Dad's photos.</p>
