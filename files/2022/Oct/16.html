        <h1>Sunday 16th October</h1>
        <p>A quiet day. While Angela went to church I charged the video camera batteries and emailed my response to not using blog pages as part of our Sussex web site. I also corrected an error in my travel cost calculations for getting to/from Rotterdam. Flying is actually Â£100 cheaper.</p>
        <p>When I checked the travel costs I found that the Eurostar return price had increased, so now we will go by plane! During the afternoon we spoke with Paul and a little later with Victoria. They had got back from their camping weekend.</p>
