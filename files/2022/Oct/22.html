        <h1>Saturday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>Luckily it was not raining when we got up. We walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and also went to the pharmacy to ge some Epederm.</p>
        <p>Then Angela made six jars of marmalade from a can of Mar Made, while for me it was down to doing the weekly accounts. I also tried to download some templates for event 'posters' and emailed Norman about Opportunities for advertising our talks at the Hawth.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Her conversations with Austin's and Juniper's teachers were encouraging. I then went off to Screwfix in Shoreham to collect the 'staples on plate' and garden wire that I had ordered.</p>
