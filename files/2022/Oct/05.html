        <h1>Wednesday 5th October</h1>
        <p>Angela was busy as usual, cutting the grass in the morning and going to table tennis in the afternoon. I talked with the man from Sussex Fruit Trees about an espalier cooking apple tree and then had a long conversation with Alan. I also did a little more to my floor plan of the cottage.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Operation Mincemeat'. I t was good, but Angela had difficulty hearing the dialogue.</p>
