        <h1>Tuesday 25th October</h1>
        <p>My day started by me walking down to the hair dresser in the High Street. Later I continued trying to mock up an IET poster. As it happened, the IET got their system working and Dave Posner was able to create a poster for the next talk.</p>
        <p>Over lunch we watched the pageantry associated with a change of Prime Minister.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela went to the butchers, I fixed wires to the staples that I had screwed on the garden wall. When Angela got back we planted the apple tree, using the fungus that we bought from the grower. The tree didn't line up very well with the wires, but Angela was able to tie in the branches.</p>
