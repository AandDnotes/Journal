        <h1>Sunday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I finished the monthly accounts and then produced a 'start' slide for Tuesdays talk. As expected, the the value of our shares and the personal pension have gone down considerably this month.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with both Victoria and Paul. In between I did a little to my floor plan of the cottage and Angela worked in the garden.</p>
