        <h1>Tuesday 18th October</h1>
        <p>Angela started her day by taking the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash. I did the final things in preparation for the evening's IET talk and replied to queries from Steve and Dave.</p>
        <p>Later I modified my calculation of how many lengths of wood I need for the bin store. However, when I tried to order them the B&amp;Q site said that they couldn't deliver to our address. It didn't say if it was a problem with delivery or stock.</p>
        <p>I left a little earlier than originally planned to go to Falmer for the IET talk, since Brighton were playing at home and there would be a lot of traffic. I turned off the A27 at Hollingbury and went into the campus via the 'back-door'. However, there was still a long queue within the campus itself. We only had a total of eight in the audience, including the convenor (Phil). Ramon did not appear and Greg was late (and then left early), so I had to set up the video camera and record the talk. I missed the introduction! I will need to check that the sound is audible and edit out comments from one member of the audience!</p>
