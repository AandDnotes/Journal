        <h1>Saturday 1st October</h1>
        <p>We started by walking down to the Farmer's Market in the High Street. The only thing we came away with was a free crab apple tree. Well, a whip, which Angela put in a pot when we got home. We then bought two more whips, a rowan and another crab apple from the Woodland Trust. We will plant all three in the front garden when they arrive.</p>
        <p>Searching for suitable whips (and tree protectors) took the rest of the morning. I then got down to the weekly accounts (including adding the analysis for the month) and also started the monthly accounts.</p>
