        <h1>Thursday 6th October</h1>
        <p>We started with a trip to the Old Barn garden centre, having first showed Angela how to install an app (the Tales Sussex app). That meant that we could get a free coffee. Angela bought a collection of plants, mainly for the new troughs that are going at the front of the house. That took the rest of the morning.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny and quite warm day, so after lunch I took the TC out for a short run (my figure of eight route) and bought some petrol. There still seems to be a slight leak from the banjo bolt going into the front carburettor.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden, including starting to fill the troughs with crocks, turf and soil. I sent a couple of IET related email.</p>
