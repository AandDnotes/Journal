        <h1>Monday 24th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had put a load of washing out to dry before she went off to her exercise group this morning. I spent a while dealing with IET email regarding advertising our talks.</p>
        <p>I then spent most of the day in the garden fixing the staples and screw-eyes on the wall. In between I found that our telephone landline had stopped working, as it should, since out TalkTalk account finished today. So I plugged the phone into the new router and, hey presto, we had a landline again. So our phone is now an IP phone, which means that it is dependent upon the router, but all landlines are due to change to IP in a couple of years.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I did a little (and I mean a little) more to my article on tuning SU carburettors.</p>
