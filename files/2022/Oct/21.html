        <h1>Friday 21st October</h1>
        <p>Having been out yesterday, today it was necessary to catch up with things like the weekly shop. So we went off to Lyons Farm. While Angela started (actually nearly finished) the shop, I went to B&amp;Q to ask about the timber that the web site says can't be delivered to our postcode. They seem to think that they are out of stock at the warehouse, but will be available at some time. I also bought some more wall plugs and a new masonry drill bit.</p>
        <p>Later, Angela dug over the bed where the new apple tree will go and I created a template in Adestra for regular email about the next IET talk, created a copy for the next talk and submitted it for approval.</p>
