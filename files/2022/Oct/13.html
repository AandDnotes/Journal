        <h1>Thursday 13th October</h1>
        <p>This morning I got dressed before breakfast so that I could take the Panda down to Simms for a service and MoT test, which included a change of brake fluid. The current certificate runs out tomorrow! They phoned at lunchtime to say that it was all done and ready for collection.</p>
        <p>I had a shower when I got back from Simms and Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to bank her lunch club cash. I dealt with some IET email, ordered speaker gifts from the IET Marketing Toolkit site and uploaded some images for Steve. I then watched the new IET President's address while eating my lunch. He (and others) spent 35 minutes saying what a grand chap he is and then two minutes saying what he will focus on as President.</p>
        <p>After collecting the car I looked for the the cause of a petrol smell from the TC. Fuel was leaking from the inlet to the front carburettor and not the new hold-up bolts. I also bent the door mirror arms a little more.</p>
