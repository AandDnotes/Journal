        <h1>Wednesday 19th October</h1>
        <p>This morning I couldn't get the iMac to read (or even recognise) the SD card from the video camera. The MacBook did read it, so I knew that the card was all right. I tried restarting the iMac, checked the settings and finally reset the hardware system with a five key depression during startup. Unfortunately I then found that I had video, but no audio. I had forgotten to turn on the microphone! I admitted my error to Ramon, Greg and Steve.</p>
        <p>Angela had an early lunch and went down to the church to help clean up an area. Then, while she was at table tennis, I cut the grass, going carefully around the new (little) trees in the front, and then printed route instructions for our trip tomorrow to Sussex fruit trees and Batemans. Angela was then out again after dinner, this time to a church committee meeting.</p>
