        <h1>Monday 10th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to the church to start cooking the lunch club meal. I started collating times and prices for various means of getting to Rotterdam. Then I went down to the church for lunch, clearing away the chairs and tables afterwards.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I joined the Eurotherm group for a Zoom chat and then went to a WSMGOC meeting at Washington. They are resurfacing the road between here and Washington, so I had to come home via the A24, A27 and the Bostal.</p>
