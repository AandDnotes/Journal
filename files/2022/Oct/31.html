        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group, I took the TalkTalk routers (in their bag) to the Post Office. Then I sent the confirmation to the UoS about the talk next month. I also sent our posters to Crawley Community Action and emailed Martin about the Sussex Wanders, since David F-B is recovering from Covid.</p>
        <p>I completed the first draft of my article on carburettor tuning.</p>
