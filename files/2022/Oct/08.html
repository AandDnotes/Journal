        <h1>Saturday 8th October</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday morning we started with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also needed some rolls. When we got home the postman delivered our trees.</p>
        <p>While I did the weekly accounts and sent some IET-related email, Angela continued working in the garden. Then, after lunch, I made two more tree guards and then planted the three trees in the front garden. The two new trees were in good condition, but only about six inches high.</p>
