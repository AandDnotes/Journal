        <h1>Wednesday 26th October</h1>
        <p>I spent quite a lot of time dealing with IET-related email, mainly about the talks programme. However, I installed a wooden front to the step in the twitten at the end of our garage.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I removed the old router and put it back in its box. I now need to raise the teak box above the draw so that there is enough height for the new router.</p>
