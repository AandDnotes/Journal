        <h1>Saturday 15th October</h1>
        <p>It didn't take long to walk down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Some time was then spent during the day reading various parts of it.</p>
        <p>As usual, I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the bank statement. I had an input that I assume is interest from one of our savings accounts, but I don't know from which. I spent quite some time trying to track it down. Then I created a 'start slide' for Tuesday's talk, along with a speaker certificate.</p>
        <p>I also signed up for Martin's walk and Clive's breakfast meeting.</p>
