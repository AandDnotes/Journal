        <h1>Tuesday 4th October</h1>
        <p>More IET related activity. A pigeon had knocked the top level off our water feature, so I went out to remove the pump. However, I decided to bring in the whole thing. So I cleaned it and put it in the garage.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela tried to print something and I realised that I'd not connected it to the new router. It took a while to find out how to do it.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunch-time since this evening was our Sussex Network's first talk of the season; in Crawley. We couldn't get a laptop to 'talk' to the installed projector. Eventually we used a portable projector with a direct HDMI cable. It was a good talk, but a topic that was too big for a single talk. I got home just before ten.</p>
