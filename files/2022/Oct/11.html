        <h1>Tuesday 11th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street and I continued to work out the cost of various options to get to Rotterdam. I'm still having difficulty believing that travelling to London the day before and staying in a cheap hotel before catching the Eurostar is cheaper than flying. I also started making a new bonnet prop out of two pieces of plastic pipe that I joined together with a home-made piece of dowel.</p>
        <p>Since Angela had a WI committee meeting in the afternoon and needed to go out in the evening, we had our main meal at lunchtime.  Then I went to an RCEA talk at Field Place. It was about using ammonia as a fuel and also about an opposing, stepped piston engine. Mike asked me to give the vote of thanks.</p>
        <p>I finished the bonnet prop when I got home and then, after tea, Angela went to the Methodist church to help provide refreshments during a talk by someone from the Repair Shop.</p>
