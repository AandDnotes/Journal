        <h1>Thursday 20th October</h1>
        <p>A busy, interesting and tiring day. We set off this morning, in the rain, for Sussex Fruit Tree near Heathfield in East Sussex. Not only did we have torrential rain on the journey, but we got lost, having missed the turn off the A27. So we were a little late, but at least the rain had stopped. We bought the espalier Bramley tree that he had kept for us. He had to remove the cane frame so that we could get it in the car. The drive to his nursery really needed a four-by-four!</p>
        <p>We then went on to Burwash and to Batemans, where we started with coffee, toured the house, had lunch and walked around the gardens. By this time we had a clear blue sky. We got home just before four.</p>
        <p>Later I ordered some staples, to screw on the garden wall, and some wire to go between them and on which to tie the branches of the new tree.</p>
