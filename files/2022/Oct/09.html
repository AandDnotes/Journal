        <h1>Sunday 9th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I emailed the IET committee about speaker gifts. I also started looking at the Eurostar options to go to Rotterdam over Christmas. This included looking at hotels near to St Pancras.</p>
        <p>We spent most of the afternoon talking with firstly Victoria and then Paul. I also started updating my diagram of the Sussex web site.</p>
