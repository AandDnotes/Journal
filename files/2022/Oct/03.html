        <h1>Monday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group I put the garden table and chairs away in the garage, which required some rearrangement. Angela put the three garden chairs in an eves cupboard. I also thried to speak to someone at TalkTalk, but after someone eventually answered I was cut off! However, I noticed that the contract 'cease' date is now 24th October. Later in the day I had a call from the man at Virgin who I spoke to last week. He confirmed that the start date was now 27th September, the day that they installed the router.</p>
        <p>We spent quite a lot of time trying to find some 'green' tree guards. Eventually I made one out of corrugated cardboard as a trial. I painted the inside white.</p>
