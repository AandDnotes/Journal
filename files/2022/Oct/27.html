        <h1>Thursday 27th October</h1>
        <p>A busy day, at least by our standard, that started wet, but then became warm and sunny. We started by going to Lidl to do the weekly grocery shop. Since we managed to get everything on the (short) list we didn't need to go on to Tesco, so went to Dunelm for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk, up the Horseshoe and back down Sopers Lane, about a one and three quarter hour walk. The remaining part of the afternoon was spent just catching up on email, although I phoned Hamish to see how is was. It seems that he has a brain tumour and his condition is likely to degenerate over time!</p>
