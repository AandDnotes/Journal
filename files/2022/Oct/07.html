        <h1>Friday 7th October</h1>
        <p>We were a little late getting going this morning since the milkman had not delivered the milk. Since we had run out, Angela went down to the High Street to buy some so that we could have breakfast. However, he arrived before we went out.</p>
        <p>So we were late going to Holmbush to do our weekly shop and to buy the food needed for Monday's lunch club. Naturally we started with coffee, then Angela bought a new coat. After that we had a trolley each, one for each of the lists. We were home by about a quarter past one.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela planted up the troughs in the front and I checked over the cars. I also checked the fluid levels in the front dampers on the TC and added some thread lock to the banjo bolt on the supply to the front carburettor.</p>
