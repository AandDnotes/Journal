        <h1>Friday 28th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early and spent the whole day in Crowborough at a meeting about a church event. She got home at four o'clock, just in time for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>I spent the morning emptying the drinks cabinet, taking it off the wall and trying to move it up a little. Unfortunately, the new holes for the baton were in a mortar joint, which meant that the plugs would not grip. So I filled the holes with filler and tomorrow will re-drill them (and hope).</p>
        <p>As I moved the electronic things off the draw unit, the phone stopped working. Eventually I discovered that the old double power adaptor had cut off the power to the base unit.</p>
        <p>After lunch I replied to several IET email and updated the events programme page.</p>
