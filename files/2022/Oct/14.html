        <h1>Friday 14th October</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We went to Ashington to have our Covid jab. We also got a flu jab (one in each arm) at the same time. Then we stopped at the Big Plant nursery for coffee and a look around.</p>
        <p>Prior to that I emailed Chichester about paying the student prizes. It seems that they need to return the completed form to me to send to the IET.</p>
        <p>We also went to Lyons Farm to do our weekly grocery shop and have a quick look at plants in B&amp;Q. Then, throughout the day, I exchanged email with the person at Sussex University who organises the food for our talks. This took quite a lot of effort, even though we only have half a dozen people registered.</p>
