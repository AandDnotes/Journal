        <h1>Sunday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>Around six o'clock this morning we had thunder and lightning, then heavy showers until just before ten. later in the morning there was another heavy show and then light showers at times during the day. Luckily Angela stayed dry when she went to church.</p>
        <p>But it did mean that I didn't get into the garden to start putting wires on the wall for the apple tree. So I tried uploading images and files to the Sussex home page and, having failed, emailed the IET.</p>
        <p>The rest of my day was spent reading the paper and doing a little work on my carburettor tuning article. Later, we spoke with Paul.</p>
