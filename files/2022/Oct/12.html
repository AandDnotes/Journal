        <h1>Wednesday 12th October</h1>
        <p>Angela was the first to leave the house, to go to the hairdressers for a hair cut. I then followed, in the TC, heading to the Roundabout Hotel in West Chiltington to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee, I set off with David F-B navigating, for the Cowdrey golf club for lunch. I got home at four o'clock, having done a total of 69 miles. The TC ran well, although the run was quite challenging.</p>
        <p>As usual, Angela went to table tennis after lunch and got home a little after me.</p>
        <p>I had a call from Hamish, who asked me to complete the arrangements for food at the next Falmer meeting. He is in St Richards hospital awaiting tests associated with his memory problem.</p>
