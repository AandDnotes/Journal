        <h1>Saturday 29th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street to get a newspaper this morning while I drilled into the filler from yesterday. So by lunchtime I had put the drinks cabinet back on the wall (with my fingers crossed) and moved the devices and wires back into place. Since the new router takes up less shelf space, the wires and plugs are more visible.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then went into the front garden. Angela spiked it, with the rotary spiker, and I raked it with the wire rake.</p>
