        <h1>Monday 17th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day, going to her exercise group in the morning and to her WI meeting after lunch. She then had to tot up her cash.</p>
        <p>I booked our flights to the Netherlands in December, sent a couple of IET related email and produced a sign to direct people to the new venue for the IET talk tomorrow evening.</p>
        <p>I refitted my home-made 'bung' in the handle of the recycling bin (with a little CA this time) and finished dismantling my old electric toothbrush to get out the battery (for recycling) and the motor (for something or other).</p>
        <p>Later I updated the IET event programme pdf file and attached it to the web page.</p>
