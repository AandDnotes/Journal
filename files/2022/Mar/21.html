        <h1>Monday 21st March</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to her exercise group this morning and I started putting together this month's newsletter. I also phoned Dad and arranged to visit him on Thursday.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela was off again, this time to her WI meeting. I continued with the newsletter and then attended a CC-UK meeting about recruiting volunteers and succession.</p>
