        <h1>Sunday 6th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I applied for my DBS. Later, Hamish called to arrange for us to verify my documents. I also paid Dad's newspaper bill, listed 'digital assets', started writing a web page and recorded Angela's lateral flow test result.</p>
        <p>We spent most of the afternoon firstly talking with Victoria and then with Paul. They have today moved back into the barn.</p>
