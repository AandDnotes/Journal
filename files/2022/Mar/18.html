        <h1>Friday 18th March</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day. She had an ENT appointment at Worthing Hospital this morning, so caught the bus into Worthing and back again. Appointments were running an hour late, so she was lucky to get home by bus.</p>
        <p>I spent the morning and part of the afternoon setting up a test event, registering for it and trying to attend by using the QR code. I could link my iPhone, but couldn't find a free QR code reader (although I didn't look very hard), so I set up the old Sony Android phone. However, I couldn't find the recommended QR code reader and, although the app that I used would decode the url from the QR code and send it to Plus4Events, there was no indication that I had attended. It was not clear if there was a limited time to attend or not. Within the hour prior to the start of the event I got a communications error.</p>
        <p>In the middle of this I cut the grass, front and both ends. Angela then cut the edges.</p>
