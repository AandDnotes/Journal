        <h1>Saturday 5th March</h1>
        <p>After our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some bread rolls, it was a case of doing mainly financial jobs. I did the weekly and then the monthly accounts and changed Dad's standing order for his increased rent. I also emailed Alan to give him the details. All this took the morning and part of the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Since we were going out, we had a late afternoon shower. Angela was a little concerned that she felt tired (she did have a very busy day yesterday), so she took a lateral flow test. It was negative.</p>
        <p>We went to the Tollgate for the WSMGOC Annual Dinner. We decided to drive, even though it is only about a mile. It was quite a good evening. I ate too much meat (beef), but one of my raffle numbers was first out of the bag and I chose a jigsaw puzzle, even though it is only a 500 piece puzzle and it has obviously been done before. We just hope that all the pieces are there. We got home at about 10:30.</p>
