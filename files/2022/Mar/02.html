        <h1>Wednesday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>We seemed to be busy most of the day, although Angela was the one one who went out. She went to table tennis after lunch as usual. I mainly dealt with my actions from the events meeting. I started by emailing thanks to our speaker of yesterday.</p>
        <p>I sent Victoria and Krista some slides that describe how to make a seed pot out of an A4 sheet of paper. Just in case the children want to plant seeds. I also tried to track down how STEM can update my DBS, but the latter's web site kept giving an error.</p>
