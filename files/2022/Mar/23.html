        <h1>Wednesday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>We had both faired fairly well from yesterday's walk, although my back is a little stiff. However, it was another fine, sunny day.</p>
        <p>Greg found nothing to comment on in this month's newsletter, so after checking the links I submitted it for approval and launch. I then read the documents for tomorrow's Gift Oversight Group meeting. It seems that I've been part of this group and its predecessor for ten years. Tomorrow is my last meeting.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis and made an appointment at Chalcraft on Friday to set up funeral plans.</p>
        <p>Later i finished drafting the next article for Main Gear.</p>
