        <h1>Friday 4th March</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to the church early to help set up for the World Day of Prayer that she was running in the afternoon. I spent most of the morning dealing with IET related items, like creating and uploading a CPD certificate for one of our talks.</p>
        <p>I also found out what I need to do to renew my DBS and asked Hamish if he would verify my documents, which he said he would. I also replied to Marnie about one of the funds.</p>
