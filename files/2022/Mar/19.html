        <h1>Saturday 19th March</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday morning we went down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Today we also bought some rolls and grapes, but then took the long (very long) route home, via the upper horseshoe. We got home at about 11:30.</p>
        <p>It was a gloriously sunny day, although with a slightly chilly wind. However, it was warm walking in the sun.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did the weekly accounts and reconciled the bank statement. Then after dinner we spoke with Victoria.</p>
