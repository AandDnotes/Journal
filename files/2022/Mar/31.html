        <h1>Thursday 31 March</h1>
        <p>The last day of March and we had a snow/sleet storm! After doing the weekly shop at Lyons Farm we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He was well and we looked through one of his photo albums. We left when his lunch arrived.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a Teams call with Greg and Michael Brown on what we could do as a local network to help progress 'sustainability'. Later I submitted our gas and electricity readings.</p>
