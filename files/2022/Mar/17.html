        <h1>Thursday 17th March</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and one that was sunny from dawn to dusk. We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly supermarket shop. I also bought a new watch strap for Dad and fitted it when we went on to visit him.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela did some potting up and I washed the garage facia and door. Unfortunately, the door is not in the sun. That is why algae grows on it! In the middle of this I had a call from Chris Richard to see if I would propose him as a member of the RCEA.</p>
