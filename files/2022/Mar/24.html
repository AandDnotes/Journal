        <h1>Thursday 24the March</h1>
        <p>We were off early, as we often do on a Thursday, to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. After coffee we went off to Victoria Grand. While waiting for our test to 'develop', we walked to Goring and back in the sunshine. Then we spent 15 minutes trying to get in! However, when we did, Dad seemed well. We stayed until his lunch arrived.</p>
        <p>I had my last Gift Oversight Group meeting after lunch. Luckily it was a short meeting and I could then correct an error in my newsletter and get it approved. I also got the go-ahead to fund the fan boats workshops for this academic year. We also filled in the funeral plan forms for our visit to Chalcraft tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Later I revisited travel options to Berkenwoude.</p>
