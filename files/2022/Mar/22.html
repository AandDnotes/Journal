        <h1>Tuesday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>A quite exhausting day, even though it was sunning all day. We started by banking Angela's WI money (quite a lot of it) in Storrington and then went on to Amberley to try the walk described in Sussex Life. The instructions said you could park at the railway station, but, although it was free, the notice said it was only free for rail users. So we parked around the corner and had coffee by the river before starting off.</p>
        <p>The walk was six miles long, but there were some serious up hill bits. We stopped for lunch by a dew pond (just before one of the uphill stretches), but the final few hundred meters from the car was difficult.</p>
        <p>Later I finished drafting this month's newsletter and got a test email sent to Greg and Steve.</p>
