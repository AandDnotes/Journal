        <h1>Wednesday 9th March</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day for both of us. Angela was out first, just before 9:30, to go walking with the WI group and then to join them for their 'Christmas lunch' at the White Horse in Steyning. It seems that they stopped for coffee in Beeding en route.</p>
        <p>I spent the morning sorting out the video recording of the last talk and sending a couple of email. Then I left home and 10:45, in the TC, and headed to Adversane, some 14 miles away. It was the first get together of the Sussex Wanderers, but only for lunch. It was dry and quite bright, even sunny, and so was a good day to have the hood down. Lunch and company was good, as was the journey home in the sunshine, 28 miles in all. I got home about ten minutes after Angela, just before 3:30.</p>
