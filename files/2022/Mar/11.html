        <h1>Friday 11th March</h1>
        <p>A quieter day, but none less busy. While Angela walked down to the High Street and to the library (she is feeling much better), I uploaded the new version of the programme booklet and mailed the link to the PEI group members. I also mailed a speaker from UK Power Networks and got a favourable reply. Then it was a case of producing notes from yesterday's PEI group meeting. I still need to finish them.</p>
        <p>Today the DBS Update Service web site worked and so I was able to subscribe to it.</p>
        <p>After lunch I joined Julie Hudson and Lisa Miles from the IET, firstly to learn how to edit the Sussex home page and then to go through how to register attendees at a talk using the QR code and a phone.</p>
