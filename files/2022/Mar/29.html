        <h1>Tuesday 29th March</h1>
        <p>Yesterday I looked at car hire costs for a seven-seater when Victoria et al are here. One company in Worthing wanted £3,500 for the 17 days and another wanted £1,900 (plus £16 per day for an extra driver). The last time we hired a car we used a company in Littlehampton, so I filled in their online form, which gave a total price of £802, including £20 for an extra driver.</p>
        <p>Whilst I was still in the bathroom this morning they phoned. They have a car available and all was well. So I paid a deposit. I need to take a 'share code' and proof of address, as well as my driving licence. When we take someone to show their documents as an additional driver we can all have a day out in Littlehampton.</p>
        <p>I walked down to the dentist just before eleven to have my broken tooth patched up. Later I added a little to my notes on 'digital assets'. The problem is that I keep finding (and examining) things from the past.</p>
