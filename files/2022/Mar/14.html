        <h1>Monday 14th March</h1>
        <p>A busy day for both of us. Angela helped with the lunch club, although her exercise group was cancelled. I was picked up  by Martin, driven to Hamish's to pick him up and then on to Chichester harbour for a walk (of about five miles). As usual, we ended up in a pup.</p>
        <p>Angela had a meal at the lunch club and so I cooked myself an omelette and then went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. In spite of it being the AGM it was quite a good evening.</p>
