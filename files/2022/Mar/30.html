        <h1>Wednesday 30th March</h1>
        <p>A quieter day, at least for me. After a few spots of rain it stayed dry and mainly bright, with the sun trying to break through the clouds on occasion.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers this morning and went to table tennis after lunch, then did a lot of cooking after that. I ordered an oil filter (which hopefully will fit) from the Octagon Club and some o-ring seals from Amazon. The oil that I ordered yesterday arrived today.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, I tried again to install the QR code scanner app on the old Android phone, only to find that it is not compatible, probably because the phone is limited to version 4.1.1 and version 12 has just been released! So I emailed Julie asking for details of the separate scanner (or for any other ideas).</p>
        <p>Continuing my sitting down activities I looked at some of my previous writings, perhaps with a view to assembling them on some web pages, and added a little more to my 'digital assets' page.</p>
