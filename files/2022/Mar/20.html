        <h1>Sunday 20th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I emailed the IET Sussex committee about content for this month's newsletter, made some notes about it and then cleared the weeds off the drive. Although it was sunny, it was not particularly warm.</p>
        While talking with Paul, he reminded me that you had to type 'Rotterdam' into the Eurostar web site so as to select it as a destination, since it does not appear in the drop-down list. So I started doing some research on how best to get to Berkenwoude for Rowan's birthday.
