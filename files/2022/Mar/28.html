        <h1>Monday 28th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group I booked our tickets to fly from Gatwick to Amsterdam, along with our parking at Gatwick. A little later I completed the 'advanced passenger information' for us both and completed the dentist forms for tomorrow's appointment.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela delivered 'Mother's Day' posies to a number of people around Steyning and I investigated hiring a 7-seater car for the trip to Wales. I also attended the Eurotherm group Zoom chat, but Hamish had forgotten to send out the invite, so there was only him and Clive on the call.</p>
