        <h1>Thursday 10th March</h1>
        <p>It was a busier day than had been planned. Not because we did more than planned, but because I had to do the weekly groceries shop on my own and then visit Dad on my own. Angela was not feeling well last night and over night. Although she was feeling better this morning, she did not think she should visit Dad.</p>
        <p>However, Angela did not rest, she did a batch of washing, did some ironing and some cleaning; just a little more slowly. I managed to work through the shopping list and then got to Victoria Grand by eleven. i left just after 12:15, when his lunch arrived. It was Connie's 100th birthday and a party was planned for the afternoon.</p>
        <p>After lunch I updated the pdf version of the joint programme booklet and after dinner I chaired the PEI group meeting.</p>
