        <h1>Sunday 13th March</h1>
        <p>Luckily it rained hard while Angela was in church, so she didn't get wet. I spent a lot of the morning making a drawing of the Sussex web sites and putting it on a 'discussion' page on EngX about everyone's views/ideas about the site. I also finished the email to the committee telling them about it and then paid our WSMGOC subscription.</p>
        <p>Most of the afternoon was spent talking with Victoria and Paul. After dinner we watched a recording of the stage version of Les Miserable.</p>
