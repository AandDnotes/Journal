        <h1>Thursday 3rd March</h1>
        <p>The day went from grey to quite bright and then to a light drizzle. For some reason we were up a little earlier than usual. Since we went to bed later than usual, due to the extended news broadcasts, a good night's sleep didn't really result in quite enough.</p>
        <p>I paid for our tickets to the WSMGOC skittles evening and discovered that I hadn't subscribed to the DBS Update service, so had to email STEM Learning. Later I received an email from them telling me that I basically had to start again and get documents verified.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we set off for Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He seemed well. He was wearing his new jogging pants and his two pairs of tailored trousers were hanging in the wardrobe, along with another pair of jogging pants that are not his! As usual, we had to take a lateral flow test before going in.</p>
        <p>From there we went to Waitrose to do the weekly groceries shop, mainly because Angela wanted to walk into Worthing to buy a kitchen gas lighter. We did start with a coffee, but it was half past four before we were home.</p>
