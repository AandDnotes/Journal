        <h1>Saturday 12th March</h1>
        <p>We started by walking the long way back from the High Street, via Mouse lane, the Rifle Range and the cricket field. Then, apart from reading the paper, I did the weekly accounts before lunch.</p>
        <p>Later it was time to finish my notes on Thursday's PEI meeting. I also looked at the code of events list part of our home page, in the hope that I could work out how to extract the list of events in a blog page. But it is not obvious. I also started drafting an email to the committee about social media and, in particular, what we can now do with our home page.</p>
