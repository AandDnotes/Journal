        <h1>Saturday 26th March</h1>
        <p>I wasn't feeling particularly well (a problem on and off since Thursday), so Angela walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. However, I did do the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Most of the rest of the day was spent reading. However, we went to the WSMGOC skittles evening at the Spur in Slindon. It was a good evening, joint with the Chichester group. Our team of four came sixth out of ten. We did not take the TC since it is a long drive back in the dark.</p>
