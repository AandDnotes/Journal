        <h1>Wednesday 16th March</h1>
        <p>We started by walking down to Chalcraft to talk about funeral plans. We left with some details and forms. They are essentially an insurance policy that pays the funeral director directly.</p>
        <p>After that, Angela went to the butchers. We should have bought some rolls, but Angela went down again to get some.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to her table tennis club, I emailed the IET to see if the Sussex Network can fund the 'fan boat' workshops. Then I started looking for images that I can use in an MG article for Main Gear.</p>
