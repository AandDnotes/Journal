        <h1>Monday 7th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her exercise group I had a Zoom call with Hamish to verify my documents for my DBS renewal. I also update Ferheen on my discussions with Mike Dillamore and replied to Mike Wooldridge about advertising an RCEA talk.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the solicitors in the High Street to talk about making new wills. I then did a little more research on making our digital assets accessible to others if we can't access them.</p>
