        <h1>Friday 25th March</h1>
        <p>The day did not start that well, with a piece of one of my teeth broke off while eating toast. Then wee took a walk down to the High Street to visit Chalcraft, where we finalised our funeral plans.</p>
        <p>A little later Angela went to help Sandie decorate the church. After lunch we went off to Squires garden centre to buy a water feature that we had seen advertised. It will stay in its box until the walled garden is re-worked. Then I mailed Paul to suggest when we could visit them in May.</p>
