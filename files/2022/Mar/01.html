        <h1>Tuesday 1st Marche</h1>
        <p>Shrove Tuesday and the first day of meteorological spring, although the misty and raining weather didn't make it seem so.</p>
        <p>I started with a Teams call with Greg on our approach to the formation of a local Institute of Technology. I then ordered my lunch for the Sussex Wanderers meeting later in the month. Then I ordered some more Covid test kits and we paid for another year of the garden waste bin.</p>
        <p>We had our meal at lunchtime, since I was convening an IET talk from 6:40. Of course, we had pancakes for desert, since it was pancake day. Later, Angela walked to the High Street to get some milk and I completed our online form for the planned hybrid talk in May. After an early tea I hosted the talk on soft materials for robotics. It was quite interesting, although we only had 61 attendees and four questions.</p>
