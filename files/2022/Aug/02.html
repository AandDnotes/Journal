        <h1>Tuesday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>We didn't have a good night. Angela and I both had a sore throat and a very tired forehead. We are hoping that it is just a cold, but we felt very tired.</p>
        <p>It was raining last night and for the whole of the morning, so the children played games and then we went down to Waitrose. Before going into the store we walked across the suspension bridge. Angela, Victoria and Brandon walked down and back, whereas the rest of us took the car. We had a 'picnic' dinner and then played games.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening Brandon tested positive for Covid. Then I tested possible as well. So we went to bed uncertain as to what we were going to do.</p>
