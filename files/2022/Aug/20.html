        <h1>Saturday 20th August</h1>
        <p>Kate and Dick are not early risers. It was about 10:30 by the time we had finished breakfast and were ready to go out. They took us to a National Trust property called 'The Workhouse'. We learnt quite a lot about workhouses in general, particularly about segregation. After some lunch in their cafe we joined a guided tour around the outside of the building. Then we each had a little tablet, which you placed over a disc to read about that particular exhibit. It worked very well. There were three floors (plus a basement), which housed 127 inmates.</p>
        <p>On the way back we drove around Newark, although (two days later) nothing stands out in my mind.</p>
