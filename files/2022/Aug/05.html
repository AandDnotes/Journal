        <h1>Friday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our fiftieth wedding anniversary. We had a card from Kate (which we had brought with us) and she sent an email after Angela told her about our covid problem.</p>
        <p>There was a little rain in the morning and Victoria stayed in bed. After lunch we finally persuaded Austin and Juniper to come out with us. We took them to Bethesda (with Brandon) and walked down to the river. They suddenly found that it was fun going out after all. They tried to build a dam and Austin and I measured the speed of floating sticks in different parts of the stream. We went over the Britannia bridge and came back over the Telford bridge.</p>
        <p>Victoria was still in bed, but got up for a cup of tea.</p>
