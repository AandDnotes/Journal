        <h1>Friday 19th August</h1>
        <p>We set off at ten to nine and got to the M25 in about 55 minutes. We had a quick stop at Cobham services, but then it was stop/start nearly all the way around to the M1 junction. Then the traffic on the M1 was heavy, coming to standstill at times. However, we got to Chris and Alan's and had a pleasant chat and lunch. We agreed that next spring we would try to organise a 'James' family get-together at Alan's.</p>
        <p>We then returned to the M1, which wasn't too bad. However, there were warnings of a 30 minute delay just before we planned to turn off onto the A46. So Angela plotted an alternative route, cutting across to the A1. It was a pleasant diversion, although we did take one wrong turn and did a few miles more than we should. We arrived in Collingham at about 5:30, having done 243 miles.</p>
        <p>Dick's Parkinson's has developed quite a bit. The 'estate' is bigger than we had imagined, with a lot of similar small bungalows. We took our bags to the 'guest suite' in the nearby block of apartments and then went back for dinner. The bathroom in our room looked identical to the ensuite in Kate and Dick's bungalow. It was quite late by the time we had finished and it had been a tiring day, particularly with the traffic.</p>
