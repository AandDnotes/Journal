        <h1>Tuesday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>We started by going off to Dunelm to buy some towels (and have some coffee) and then went off to Lidl to do some food shopping. That essentially took all morning.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was spent doing the accounts and adding a little more to my Wales trip web site. Angela did a couple of loads of washing, in spite of some rain.</p>
        <p>Then, after a relatively early dinner, I went to Lower Beeding to meet up with members of the IET Sussex Network committee for a social gathering.</p>
