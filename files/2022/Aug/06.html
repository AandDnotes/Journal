        <h1>Saturday 6th August</h1>
        <p>WE were all feeling better and it was a fine, mainly sunny day. Surprisingly we were all packed up and ready to leave by 9:30. According to Google Maps it would be 25 minutes quicker going along the A55 and then down the M6 than if we followed the A5. So we set off towards Conway. It was interesting going along the A55 since everything had changed. The trip down the toll road part of the M6 was interesting only in that we had not been on that stretch of the road before and it was probably quite a bit faster, even if it did cost Â£6.50.</p>
        <p>We stopped at a service station before the toll road for a toilet break and a snack, but then had to wait for a service area on the M42 for lunch. We stood/sat on the grass since all the picnic tables were in use. Then it was down the A34 to Milton, near Didcot for the hotel, where we arrived at about 3:30. Once, on our way back from the Lake District, we stopped here for fuel. It is not a particularly pleasant area, being surrounded by industrial estates.</p>
        <p>Since we wanted to get a take-away and McDonalds was almost next door to the hotel we were introduced to ordering from them on their app. If that wasn't difficult enough, collecting our food was a nightmare. I had confirmed everything, but had not completed the final step to get an order code. So we had to wait and it was heaving with people, in addition to a long 'drive-through' queue.</p>
        <p>Then, when the food arrived it was in small bags and a drinks holder. So I had to pick larger bags to put it all in. Then we found that they had forgotten to include Brandon's fries! By the time we ate our meal we had cups of cold coffee. Never again! I will delete the app.</p>
