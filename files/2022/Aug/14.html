        <h1>Sunday 14th August</h1>
        <p>Another hot day, although it clouded over later in the day. Angela went to church and I finished the accounts.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage to see if I could fix the carburettor bolts in place. I discovered that the thread in the body of the front carburettor has stripped. Getting the carburettors refurbished would be expensive, so I researched the possibility of using helicoils.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul et al. Then, after dinner, we had a call from Kate, who gave us instructions on how to find them.</p>
