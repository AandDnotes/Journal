        <h1>Wednesday 17th August</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, tackling a number of things. Angela went off with her WI walking group and I started by packing up the carburettor bodies. Then I booked delivery to Burlens using DPD, since I could take it to Beeding Pharmacy. While out, I went to Beeding Service Station and filled the Panda with petrol in preparation for our trip on Friday.</p>
        <p>I then had a call from the receptionist at the solicitors in Lancing. They have no record of Dad's will, but she did say that there had been another solicitors in that parade of shops. She was able to give me their details, including who had taken them over. So I phoned them (in Worthing) and they will check their archives.</p>
        <p>Just as we were finishing lunch so a man (Donald) from Virgin Media called. Now that they have installed the fibres they are offering installation (paid for by the Government) with broadband and VoIP telephone for £24 per month for 18 months. We currently pay £42. After 18 months, of course, the price will go up! The contract will start as the TalkTalk one ends.</p>
        <p>We then went off to Storrington so that Angela could bank her WI cash. We also bought some food in Waitrose and then we went to Squires to buy some bulbs for Kate &amp; Dick as a house warming present. There was some quite heavy rain.</p>
