        <h1>Thursday 11th August</h1>
        <p>We were up early so as to get Victoria et al to Gatwick by ten o'clock. We dropped them off and later paid the 'drop-off' fee online. We were home by eleven.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took the hire car back to Littlehampton. When we got home we were able to relax a little, although Angela did some more washing and ironing.</p>
        <p>It was another hot day, being the first of a heat warning alert.</p>
