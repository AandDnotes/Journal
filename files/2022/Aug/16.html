        <h1>Tuesday 16th August</h1>
        <p>For Angela, today was mainly about her WI tea party, being held in someone's garden. So gentle rain, followed by torrential rain and thunder did not look promising. However, it filled the water butts and at least started to water the garden; plus it stopped raining at lunchtime.</p>
        <p>After phoning a solicitors in Lancing, who will look to see if they have Dad's will, I went into the garage. I removed the rear carburettor and found that the thread in the body was damaged. So I phoned James at Burlens and left a message. He phoned back and said that he would fit a Helicoil, but they have some special tools.</p>
        <p>So I spent the rest of the day stripping down the two carburettors and giving the the bodies a bit of a clean. Angela's tea party went well.</p>
