        <h1>Monday 15th August</h1>
        <p>It was not so hot today, the start of the decline to more normal temperatures and there may even be a little rain tomorrow or the day after.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her exercise group and then did her lunch club accounts. I firstly contacted the Solicitors Register and found that Hagues had merged in 1996 with another group in Cheshire. They checked their archive and called back. They found a 'will file' but there was no will in it. They also found a house sale file. Later I found the solicitors in Lancing where Mum and Dad went, although I can't remember why. It was too late for them to answer their phone.</p>
        <p>While Angela baked a cake for tomorrow's WI garden party I called Burlen. It seems that they can re-thread the carburettor body for about Â£100. Tomorrow I will remove the rear carb and then call James in their renovation department. I had also emailed Bob Gunau, Steve Priston and Peter Cole. Both Steve and Peter replied. Peter thinks that the bolt is a different size.</p>
