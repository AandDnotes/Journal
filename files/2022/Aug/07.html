        <h1>Sunday 7th August</h1>
        <p>We were the only people wearing masks in the Beefeater this morning and we were away by 9:30. We came down the A34 to Winchester and then drove across to pick up the A272, which we followed all the way to Petworth. From there it was Pulborough and then Storrington.</p>
        <p>All was well when we got home at 12:30. Angela and I walked down to the High Street to buy some food. We bought bread and some vegetables at a 'pop-up' store in the car park of the Star. We bought the rest, including a chicken, in Budgens.</p>
        <p>Apart from having a chat with Paul, the rest of the day seemed to involve preparing and eating food. However, I did wrap the washing line spike in some roofing felt so as to stop it wobbling in the ground.</p>
