        <h1>Wednesday 31st August</h1>
        <p>Our morning involved walking for both of us. Angela went for a long walk with her WI group up to Henfield (and then took the bus back) whereas I only walked to the 'cows field' to pick blackberries and then along the bypass and through Clays Field. I picked up a couple of cooking apples from the house on the Bostal, so I was out for less than an hour. The rest of my morning was spent reading (newspaper and email).</p>
        <p>Angela spent the afternoon in the garden, cutting the two rear lawns whilst there. I sorted out Dad's bits and pieces that had been sat in a couple of paper carrier bags in the study. I found that both carriage clocks worked, if they had new batteries, and gave three magnifying glasses an initial clean. I sent a photo of the clocks and the brass pot to Alan to see if he wants any of them.</p>
