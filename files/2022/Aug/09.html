        <h1>Tuesday 9th August</h1>
        <p>Another day of wall-to-wall sunshine and temperatures of around 27 degrees. We set off fairly early, for us, and took the children to Shoreham Fort and on to the beach. They had a good time collecting stones and shells and paddling. Even Angela and I had a little paddle. The stones were very hard to walk on.</p>
        <p>We then had coffee/ice cream at the 'kiosk' before coming home for lunch. However, we had to stop at Lidl in Shoreham to buy some things for lunch.</p>
        <p>It was too hot to do anything during the afternoon, so the children played computer games and we read. Victoria and Brandon started another, oval jigsaw puzzle and I paid the window cleaners and returned Dad's over-paid Attendance Allowance. Then Victoria and I went down to the High Street to get some fish and chips, after which we were too full to do anything.</p>
