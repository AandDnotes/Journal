        <h1>Saturday 27th August</h1>
        <p>We were back to our usual routine today by starting off with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some items of food. It was a little cooler, but a comfortable temperature and, until later in the day, was sunny.</p>
        <p>When we got back, and after sitting in the garden to drink coffee, Angela continued working in the garden. I did a number of finance related things. I set the maturity options for one of Angela's savings bonds and did the weekly accounts. Then I tried to upload my web page about our trip to North Wales to the Github server. However, Github Desktop kept getting stuck and not finishing. Later in the day I tried a variety of things to no avail. In the end I uploaded them using Github through the browser. But I still need to get Desktop to behave and sync with Github.</p>
        <p>We tried to contact Victoria, but she replied that she was out today. So we will try tomorrow.</p>
