        <h1>Wednesday 24th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI group, I went to the optician for an eye test. It seems that my last test was four years ago! My distance sight is good (I don't need my old grasses), I just need my reading glasses. However, I have a cataract starting in my right eye and I need to use a hot compress (twice a day) to clear blocked-up glands on my eyelids.</p>
        <p>Apart from clearing out some email, I started cleaning parts of the carburettors. I had a call from the Octagon Club (actually Brian Rainbow) to say that they only had one gasket kit. So they are sending that and I ordered another one from Burlen (at a much higher price).</p>
        <p>Angela cut the back gardens grass and I cut the front grass.</p>
