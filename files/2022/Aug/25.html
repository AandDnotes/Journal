        <h1>Thursday 25th August</h1>
        <p>There was heavy rain during the early hours of the morning and a steady rain continued until lunchtime. So we spent the morning inside doing odds and ends such as completing the submission of Angela's WI gift aid and putting things back in the storage under the spare bed. I also added a little to my North Wales trip web page.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was dry and partly sunny, so Angela went down to the High Street and then cooked biscuits. I finished cleaning the carburettor parts and then 'zapped' weeds on the drive.</p>
