        <h1>Sunday 21st August</h1>
        <p>Another late start. This time we firstly went to Karen' house and then went on to Lincoln. Although Collingham is in Nottinghamshire (just), Karen's house is in Lincolnshire.</p>
        <p>Karen and her family are in the US on holiday and so Kate and Dick have to feed the chickens. They have three, which all looked a but unkempt. Karen's house is a large Georgian place with all its ground to the front (and up to a busy main road). Behind is a farm.</p>
        <p>We then eventually found our way into the centre of Lincoln and parked under the walls of the castle. We had lunch in the cathedral refectory, then walked inside the cathedral and then around the grounds of the castle (inside the walls). Lincoln is much more of a tourist destination than we had realised.</p>
        <p>After dinner we went to a room on the ground floor of the apartment block, where people gather on a Sunday evening to play 'casino' games. So we played black-jack and roulette. The organiser provides a bag of chips. It was a little bit odd. At least we only had to go upstairs to our room.</p>
