        <h1>Saturday 13th August</h1>
        <p>We took our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also bought a rather expensive melon.</p>
        <p>I started sorting out the Visa slips that we had collected over the past couple of weeks. I then updated my spreadsheet for July and the monthly spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They had a good journey home.</p>
