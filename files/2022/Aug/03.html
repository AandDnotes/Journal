        <h1>Wednesday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>Paul and Krista did not have any symptoms and Paul' test was negative. So they decided to change their flight to this evening. They firstly went into Waitrose to buy food for us and then set off. They planned to take the long route via Betws-y-Coed so that Rowan could see some mountains. changing their flights and cancelling their hotel cost them quite a lot.</p>
        <p>We all feeling no worse, so sat around during the morning and then went for a walk down to the Menai Straights and back. The children managed, albeit with some complaints. It was about as far as I could walk. We then cooked omelets and chips and planned an early night.</p>
