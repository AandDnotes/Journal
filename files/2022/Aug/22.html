        <h1>Monday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>We had decided to try going home via a different route. This time we took the A1 south to the M11 (via the A14), followed that to the M25, went over the Dartford crossing and then round the M25 to the M23. We did not have any hold-ups on the entire journey.</p>
        <p>We took a diversion just after the A1(M), down quite a nice A road, to Wimpole Estate, a National Trust property. It was very large. We looked at the Home Farm, but did not get near the house. Our plan was to have lunch there, which we did, but the eating facilities were not very good.</p>
        <p>Having left Collingham at 9:45, we arrived home at four o'clock. I think that if we are going to spend the best part of two days travelling, then we need to spend more than two days doing things. So the next time we must go somewhere else as well.</p>
