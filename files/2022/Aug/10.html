        <h1>Wednesday 10th August</h1>
        <p>The temperature according to our outside thermometer reached almost 30 degrees this afternoon. Before it got too hot we drove down to Lancing Green and spent some time on the beach, paddling in the sea and collecting shells. We stopped at Sainsbury's on the way home to get some bread and to part fill the car with diesel.</p>
        <p>The hot afternoon was spent reading, with the children playing computer games, although Angela did go to the library a little later in the afternoon. Victoria et al spent part of the afternoon packing their bags in preparation for their return home tomorrow. Victoria also completed their travel information and checked in.</p>
        <p>The children continued to want snacks before going to bed. In fact Juniper wanted a hard-boiled egg!</p>
