        <h1>Friday 26th August</h1>
        <p>When we got up the weather didn't look too promising, with mist or low cloud covering the hills. However, it soon cleared and was a mainly sunny day with light winds. By the time that I'd finished in the bathroom Angela was already in the garden, but we went for a walk to collect blackberries. We didn't have to go very far, in fact only to the 'cows field' and we picked up a some cooking apples on the way back from a bucket outside someone's house on the Bostal.</p>
        <p>Angela continued working int he garden and, before lunch, I put some teak oil on the garden table and chairs. Later, Angela went to the library and I completed my write-up of our trip to North Wales. I now need to upload it to Github and add a link from our 'trips' page. Angela also cooked a blackberry and apple pie, although we had some raspberries to finish off first.</p>
