        <h1>Friday 12th August</h1>
        <p>We both felt tired today. We don't know whether that is due to the heat or to Covid.</p>
        <p>We moved the dining table back into the dining room this morning, after I had glued felt pads back on to some of the legs of some of the chairs. We also washed some of the floors. Angela did the cloakroom and hall and I did the dining room. It was too hot do anything else, although Angela went down to the Coop later in the day.</p>
        <p>I phoned the owner of Victoria Grand, who had not found my email about Dad's bank account. She doesn't use either of the addresses that I had used! Later in the day I had an email from the probate office, saying that the will I had sent is not the original!</p>
