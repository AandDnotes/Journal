        <h1>Monday 1st August</h1>
        <p>A tiring day for a number of reasons. Angela went off to get some milk before most of the rest were up. Then it was decided that it would be a good idea to go to a beach, since it was due to be sunny in the morning, with some rain later in the day. It was also due to be cooler later in the week. We decided to go to a beach just past Moelfe, which had all the facilities that we needed.</p>
        <p>We drove to the beach and parked. Before we had found a place to sit, they were off exploring on the tide-line. Eventually they returned with stones and shells. We then went to the cafe to get some lunch. The only problem was that they did not have enough tables for all those eating. However, we sat on a stone. Then we went for a walk along the coastal path before heading home.</p>
        <p>V, B, K and P went off to do some general grocery shopping at Waitrose while I explored somewhere to stay on our journey home and booked a table at the local pub for Friday evening.</p>
        <p>We ordered some food from the local Indian take-away for dinner.</p>
