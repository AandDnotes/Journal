        <h1>Tuesday 30th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went off to find a courgette, I walked down to the High Street to get a hair cut. It seemed a bit lopsided, but is okay.</p>
        <p>I spent more time on a design for a bin store. As well as slightly modifying the design, I worked out how much timber I need. It will cost quite a lot, but cheaper than a bought one. Otherwise a lot of reading was done.</p>
