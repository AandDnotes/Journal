        <h1>Monday 29th August</h1>
        <p>The last bank holiday until Christmas! But it was a mainly sunny day. We needed a few things from the Coop, so we took the long route, via the lower horseshoe. We stopped at Victoria Sponge for a coffee, sitting outside.</p>
        Angela spent the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon working in the garden. I booked a haircut and produced a design for a bin store after measuring the three bins.
