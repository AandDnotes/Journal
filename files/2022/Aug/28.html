        <h1>Sunday 28th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I managed (without really knowing how) to get Github Desktop on the iMac to to sync with Github. Then I produced a web page about our trip to Collingham and added a link from the 'Trips' page.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with both Victoria and Paul. As usual, Victoria really just spoke to us. The children seem to be enjoying their stay with Claudia and Gene. Although we don't know why, Krista had met a friend in Manchester and gone to Blackpool, perhaps on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. So Paul had to take Rowan to school and look after the animals.</p>
