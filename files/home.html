It is intended only to be read by me; a sort of aid memoir to help my poor memory.</p>
        <p>I set up this format in 2018, so years prior to that have one page per month. From 2018 onwards there is one page per day.</p>
        <p>It would be good to have a search capability on this page. However, at least for the time being, I can search in the repository on GitHub.</p>
