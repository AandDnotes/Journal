        <h1>Wednesday 31st July</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was for thunder storms. However, although it was cloudy during the morning (there was a shoer at about three o'clock), it became sunny and very warm during the afternoon. The outside thermometer was showing 28 deg C.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went walking with her friends. They went to Washington woods.</p>
        <p>Since we were expecting more rain, I took in the sail, taking the opportunity to shorten the ropes that that hold the sail to the house wall. Then it was back to researching fusion reactors. Throughout the day I completed making notes (and finding images) on the remaining companies and completed the notes on the timeline. Now I just need to try to put it together into a talk!</p>
