        <h1>Sunday 14th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I printed my tickets for tomorrow and emailed Colin C about a Zoom link. The I went into the garage and found the items that need to go with the TC, putting them in the tonneau area, including the spare wheel. I had forgotten that, when I bought the car, there was a new thermostat in its holder. I could have fitted it when I had the engine's head off.</p>
        <p>After lunch I added a section to the TC's web pages about the alternative method of tuning carburettors. However, my attempts to copy these amendments to the TC's site. GitHub said that the process had failed and, even though I was able to re-run the last two stages (successfully), it has still not worked.</p>
        <p>We had forgotten that Paul was at home on his own, Krista and Rowan being in London. We had a chat and found that Rowan now has an electric bike, a refurbished one, for her journey to school. Afterwards we spoke with Victoria.</p>
