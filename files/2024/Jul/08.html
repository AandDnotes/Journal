        <h1>Monday 8th July</h1>
        <p>Perhaps the busiest day of the week. Jason the roofer arrived at about 8:30 to start on the garage roof. We discussed the support of the joists over the window and he went off to buy some 4"x2" timber and some joist hangers. By around four o'clock they had covered the roof with OSB sheets and two layers of felt.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the church to help set up for lunch club and I went to the optician for my check after the cataract surgery. My distance sight is excellent, but I need reading glasses and there is a slight difference between my two eyes. So I'm having new lenses in my old frames. That still cost Â£150!</p>
        <p>Later I went down to the church for lunch and helped clear up afterwards.</p>
        <p>Before and after lunch I completed my article on SU carburettor tuning, uploading it to my main site and to my MG site as well as producing a text version.</p>
        <p>Later still I went to the MGOCC meeting at Washington. It started raining just before I went and continued for the rest of the evening.</p>
