        <h1>Saturday 20th July</h1>
        <p>A fairly standard Saturday. We started with our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then I did the weekly accounts while Angela worked in the garden. I also did a little more to my notes on Thursday's PEI meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a chat with Victoria. It seems that Brandon is in the process of applying for an academic position at Cornel University in Ithica, New York state. An ex-colleague contacted him, suggesting that he might be interested in the post. He has to outline his research programme as well as his teaching programme, so it is quite an ask.</p>
        <p>Juniper has been going to swimming lessons each day and Austin is at Scout camp next week.</p>
        <p>We watched/listened to yesterday's First Night of the PROMS. I was a very good concert.</p>
