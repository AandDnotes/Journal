        <h1>Thursday 25th July</h1>
        <p>The day started drizzly, turned to heavy rain after lunch and then went back to drizzle.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday we started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. We then went on to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee and to get some indoor plant compost. We also looked at their new shoe department.</p>
        <p>The contract from Milestone Classics arrived (on time). I 'signed' it and sent it back. It seems that they set contracts initially for six weeks, but are flexible.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the afternoon researching items (mainly images) for my talk on fusion.</p>
