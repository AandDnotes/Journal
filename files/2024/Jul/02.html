        <h1>Tuesday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street, meeting several people on the way there and back, I put the items together that I would need for my visit to Upper Beeding Primary School to sort out next week's workshop. Then, just before lunch, I put a coat of wax on the TC. Towards the end I had a call from Martin to say that he could go on the Wanderers run next week. So I sent our lunch orders to Ursula.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I went to UBPS to talk with Dee and Chris. We installed the CoCo software on one PC and connected a control box to it. I'd taken a push button and a lamp to help with the testing. We sorted out how we would organise the workshop and Chris will install the CoCo software on the other PCs once the West Sussex IT support person is happy with the first installation. When I got home I emailed Keith and Greg.</p>
