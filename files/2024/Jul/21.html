        <h1>Sunday 21st July</h1>
        <p>Angela spent the morning making biscuits and a chocolate roulade, the latter of which we then took to Fran and Davids house at Liminster for the WSMGOC barbecue. It was warm, although mostly cloudy, but the rain kept off and there were some sunny spells. We arrived at about ten past twelve and the food was just about to be served. We probably eat a week's worth of meat, even if some of it was processed.</p>
        <p>We got home just after four and a little later spoke with Paul. Rowan had enjoyed her trip to London, even if the best part was having dough balls in Pizza Hut! They have booked a 14-bed house on the coast near Brugge for three nights while we are all with them next month.</p>
