        <h1>Monday 29th July</h1>
        <p>A clear blue sky for most of the day. It is only this evening that some high cloud has rolled in. And it was quite warm.</p>
        <p>While Angela was at her Monday club, I set the maturity option on a savings account and checked another account before spending a couple of half-hour sessions 'scrubbing' weeds of the top part of the drive and sweeping the steps. The time in between was spent reading the paper. In any case, it was too hot to do much outside.</p>
        <p>Later I collected a few more images of fusion devices, existing and imagined, and started making notes on the 'private' fusion ventures. It will be difficult to make the talk more interesting than just a list of devices.</p>
        <p>We again got caught up in the mountain bike race at the Olympics. This time it was the men and as we started watching so the Englishman in the lead got a puncture and had to stop for a front wheel change. Amazingly he caught up the leader, a Frenchman, during the final lap and overtook him. Then the Frenchman took back the lead, but the UK man forced his way past in the woods, just before the final run to the finish. It was quite exciting, particularly since it meant a gold medal for the UK.</p>
