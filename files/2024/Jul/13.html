        <h1>Saturday 13th July</h1>
        <p>After our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper I did the weekly accounts and reconciled the bank statement. I also set the maturity options for both our Virgin ISAs and collected together the documents for the TC.</p>
        <p>It was Repair Cafe time, so after lunch I went off to Beeding village hall. It was fairly quiet, but we had a pretty constant flow of broken items, some of which we were able fix.</p>
