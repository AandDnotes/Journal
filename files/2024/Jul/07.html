        <h1>Sunday 7th July</h1>
        <p>Heavy rain early this morning and then a heavy show just before lunch, but otherwise lots of sunny spells, although not particularly warm. Angela went to church as usual and didn't get too wet.</p>
        <p>I spent some time working on my Main Gear article and otherwise read the paper. Later we spoke with Paul and Rowan (briefly). Rowan has a busy week. She has two more performances of their school musical (with a party at the end), finishes school this week and goes to London with Krista and a friend next weekend. So Paul will be on his own next weekend.</p>
