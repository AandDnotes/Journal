        <h1>Tuesday 30th July</h1>
        <p>A really hot day. It was at least 28 degrees C. At various times I did bits of research on my fusion talk. Before it got too hot I went out and sprayed the weeds on the lower part of the drive with white vinegar. Hopefully that we weaken them and I can 'scrub' them off in a day or two.</p>
        <p>Just after lunch I attended the IET Education Volunteers Teams meeting. Was it worth attending? I'm not sure, but I might join it next time.</p>
        <p>Then we walked to the health centre to have our second shingles jab.</p>
