        <h1>Friday 19th July</h1>
        <p>After a latish start (mainly reading last week's newspaper) I started putting together the notes of yesterday evening's PEI meeting. At about 3:45 we left for Chichester. The traffic at the usual spots (Storrington and inside the Chichester bypass) was bad, but we had a cup of tea in the theatre cafe and walked around the park/rugby field area before going back to the cafe for a sandwich and piece of cake. There was a school choir and a jazz band playing outside.</p>
        <p>The musical, Oliver, was fantastic. I've never seen so many people stand at the end. We managed to get out of the car park very quickly, but the A283 was closed from the Washington roundabout, so we had to go down the A24, along the A27 and then over the Bostal, three sides of a rectangle. It was about 11:15 when we got home.</p>
        <p>It was a hot, calm, sunny day throughout.</p>
