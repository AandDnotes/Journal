        <h1>Friday 5th July</h1>
        <p>It was a rainy morning, so I tested each of the models and interface boxes that I will take to the workshop on Tuesday. Angela did some cleaning.</p>
        <p>By lunchtime the rain had stopped and so, after eating, we walked to the pharmacy to get my tablets and then bought some butter. A little later I had a Teams call with Greg and Keith, leading them through the CoCo software. After dinner I watched the final episode of 'Outlaws'.</p>
