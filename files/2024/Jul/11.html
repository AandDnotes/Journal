        <h1>Thursday 11th July</h1>
        <p>The day was unusual for several reasons. Firstly, the unattached piece of felt on the front of the garage roof seemed to be fixed before we went out, but it turned out to be a piece of felt that was used to prevent a ladder damaging the edge.</p>
        <p>We started our outing to the supermarket by going to Brooklands to walk around the park (it's bigger than it looks) and then have coffee in their cafe. Then we set off to go to Lyons Farm. However, when we turned on to the A27 we almost immediately ran into a traffic jam. It took us about half an hour to get to Lyons Farm (normally a five minute journey). It looked as though road works west of Lyons Farm was the problem.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the library and I picked up my glasses from the opticians. Prior to going out I called Jamie Crips at Milestone Classics. The call went through to his voice mail, but he called back while I was walking down to the High Street. He would be happy to 'market' the TC (for 10%), but thinks that the price should be Â£23K. I have to decide what to do. The car is being advertised in 'Enjoying MG' in August (also when the MoT expires) and Jamie expects to be able to sell it in 4-6 weeks.</p>
        <p>When I got home I opened the invoice from Steyning Roofing. In spite of not stripping off the old felt and not removing the old roof panels, as quoted, but as agreed, he had charged the full amount. When I phoned him he told me to rip up the invoice and he would produce another one, excluding those items, as though there was no problem!</p>
        <p>Finally, we were due to hold our quarterly PEI group meeting, but Colin (who had to invite people into the Zoom meeting) was delayed getting home. So I decided to postpone the meeting for a week.</p>
