        <h1>Friday 26th July</h1>
        <p>A cooler, but brighter and dry day. I spent a lot of the morning trying to work out what was happening with Angela's email. She had nearly four thousand email in the Archive folder including email that she had sent. It turned out that the Archive folder is set to contain 'all email', which is different to mine, but seems to have changed between us each setting up our accounts. It also seemed that the protocol was set to both POP and IMAP and POP puts sent mail into the INBOX. So I disabled POP and all seemed well. But Angela still has all those email to delete.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time collecting images and information for my talk on fusion.</p>
        <p>We then spent most of the evening watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Paris. The sun was still shining here, but it was pouring with rain there.</p>
