        <h1>Wednesday 24th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her friends I phoned Jamie Crips about not hearing anything from Tony, his business partner. A little later, Tony phoned. He said that Jamie had been in hospital since the beginning of the week and that they had now taken his phone away from him. He didn't say what the problem was. However, they had decided not to take on any more cars, our TC essentially being the last. He had picked up the documents yesterday and said he would send me the contract tomorrow. Somehow I don't feel that confident.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I brushed off the front fence, sanded all the parts and painted the four posts (with Cuprinol wood stain). Later, I painted the bars. They now look much better.</p>
        <p>Following an email from Robin S about my offer to give a talk to the flying club, where he questioned if it would be too technical for the members, I added another slide to remind the audience about amplitude, frequency and wavelength. However, although I use plenty of diagrams, it may still be too technical.</p>
