        <h1>Monday 15th July</h1>
        <p>A long and tiring day. Angela took me to Shoreham station where I met Dave Posner and we caught the train, along with other members of the London walkers, to Victoria. The Shakespeare pub was closed, so we went into the Market Hall (a food court) for coffee and a long chat, before setting off on the Tube to The Angle. We then walked along the Regent Canal to Limehouse Basin and it's connection with the Thames. It was quite a gentle walk, with light rain starting just as we left Angle tube station and easing just before we stopped for lunch. Lunch took a long time since four people (of the nine of us) wanted something cooked and they said they had a very small kitchen.</p>
        <p>The rest of the walk was dry (I even put my sun hat on) and there was quite a lot of wild life, including a couple of herons. We stopped for a drink at The Grapes pub at Limehouse, apparently owned by Sir Ian McKellen. The staff that he used as Gandalf in Lord of the Rings was behind the bar.</p>
        <p>We then decided to take the boat from Canary Wharf to Westminster. This was a mistake, since we had quite a long wait and then the journey was slow due to the number of stops that it made. Some decided to stop for dinner and take a later train, wear as Martin, Steve and I tried to catch the planned train. Liz also needed to catch a particular train down to Arundel. We walked very fast, but were too late for the train, so caught the next one, buying a sandwich at the station.</p>
        <p>I repeated tried phoning home, but it would ring and then go to the voice mail. So I waited half an hour for a bus at Shoreham. It seems that Angela had taken a phone handset into the garden and had inadvertently pressed the 'do not disturb' button. So the handsets were showing my mobile number, but not ringing! I got home after ten, feeling very tired.</p>
