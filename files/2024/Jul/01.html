        <h1>Monday 1st July</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day. She caught the bus to Shoreham, a train to Arundel (changing at Ford) and met her friends for the day. Then the return journey got here home at about 6:15.</p>
        <p>Over the day I moved money around so as to add my ISA allowance to a recently opened (after maturity) ISA. On the theme of finance, I updated the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>Amongst that, I cleaned the TC's fourth wheel, put the front wheels back on and lowered the car to the ground. Then I wiped over the paintwork and put some wax on the dashboard.</p>
        <p>When Angela got home I cooked dinner.</p>
