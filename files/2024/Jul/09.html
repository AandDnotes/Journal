        <h1>Tuesday 9th July</h1>
        <p>If today wasn't quite as busy as yesterday, it was more tiring. Angela caught the bus to Storrington to bank the lunch club cash. I checked my article for Main Gear and prepared it for sending off to Roger. I had problems in that my DJsMGs web site would not update. It took quite a while to find the problem, but then I could point Roger to it to illustrate the layout.</p>
        <p>I had an early lunch and then took the Control Technologies kit to Upper Beeding Primary School, where I met Keith and Greg. We set up and then ran the workshop for three hours. The year 5 children (about 24 of them) seemed to enjoy it. But it was very tiring.</p>
        <p>The roofer was not able to do much to the garage roof today due to the rain.</p>
