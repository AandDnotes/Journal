        <h1>Friday 12th July</h1>
        <p>I thought that other days were busy, but today was busier still. At least, it was the most tiring.</p>
        <p>We decided on the dates that we would go to Berkenwoude in August. So I checked the times and costs of flights from Gatwick and compared parking with booking a taxi. Then I checked with Paul that the dates were fine with them and booked BA flights and a taxi to take us to Gatwick and return home. I had to enter Angela's details, including passport, yet again. I thought that I was booking a taxi from Steyning Taxis, but it went to a 'hub' and they gave the work to Gatwick Taxis.</p>
        <p>I talked with Jamie Crips and agreed to take the TC over to him on Wednesday afternoon for him to sell it. I decided to do this since we will be away for two weeks during August. I was walking down to have my hair cut when he called back. So now I'm shaun ready for our trip and have committed to selling the car.</p>
        <p>Later, I finally got in the garage to finish taking down the plastic sheets and moving things back in place. I also put tools in my tool bag, ready for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
