        <h1>Monday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>A wet start and rain on and off throughout the day. Angela went to her Monday club and I completed the notes on Thursday's PEI meeting and sent it out. Having done that, I created a APM logo image from the svg file that Kieth Hardy sent me and updated the blog page that provides links to the PEI's events lists.</p>
        <p>There was an email from the flying club asking for people to give talks over the winter. So I looked back at the presentation I created in 2021. I found a few images that I could use to introduce myself.</p>
        <p>Angela had her hair cut, quite short, but not layered.</p>
