        <h1>Saturday 27th July</h1>
        <p>Being Saturday we did our usual trip to the High Street to buy a newspaper and I did the weekly accounts. Otherwise I did some more research on fusion. I put up the sail, but it clouded over a bit, so we didn't actually sit outside.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Juniper has been enjoying her swimming lessons each day and has had quite a few friends around to play. Meanwhile Austin has been at Scout camp. Victoria had to finish our call and go off to collect him from the drop-off point.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunchtime, since in the evening we went off to the Steyning Centre for a big band concert. They played (and someone sang) Gershwin songs, which was good. But they were far too loud for the size of the hall and some seemed to think that their job was to blow their trumpet as loudly as they could.</p>
