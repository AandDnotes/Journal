        <h1>Wednesday 10th July</h1>
        <p>The roofers were here early, sweeping the water off the garage roof. Angela went off walking (down to Shoreham Fort) and I was picked up by Martin Greenhalgh in his MGB Roadster and driven to West Dean to meet up with the members of the Sussex Wanderers.</p>
        <p>Martin and I were one of the last to leave the Selsey Arms and one of the last to return there after the 25-mile run. We only took one wrong turn! However, it was a good run, with the hood down from when we left here. Although my 'ham, eggs and chips' was fine, I don't think I'll have it again. However, the summer pudding was very good.</p>
        <p>When I got home the roofers had left, saying that they were finished. However, I'd easily noticed that some felt on the front edge had not been fixed down, so I phoned the roofer, who said that he would come back some time tomorrow morning to fix it. The top looks a bit of a patchwork and some of the edging does not line up. Also, there is still a dip in the roof due to the dropped joist. So overall I'm not particularly happy with the job.</p>
