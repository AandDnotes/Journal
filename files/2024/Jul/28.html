        <h1>Sunday 28th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I prepared an Adestra email to tell members about the update to the recording of Graeme's talk and about the change of venue in Crawley. I spent a lot of time trying to find the link to the revised YouTube video. For some reason, the link to YouTube Studio was not there to start with.</p>
        <p>I then discovered that our videos now include advertisements! I wasn't able to find a way to turn them off, even though the help described how to do it. I turned off personalised ads, but the $ symbol by each video (for turning ads off) was not there.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny day from dawn to dusk, although we didn't do much outside. I did some more research on both MGBs and on fusion.</p>
        <p>Later in the day we spoke to Paul. They hadn't done much and neither had we, so the call was fairly short. We had watched the women's mountain bike race at the Olympics and they were watching the skateboarding.</p>
