        <h1>Thursday 18th July</h1>
        <p>It was an early(ish) start, since I had an appointment at the Health Centre for a blood test and blood pressure check. I was a little early and so I was out by the time of my first appointment. I was also weighed (76Kg; 11st 13lb) and got the results of the blood test later in the day. There were only a dozen items and did not include PSA or cholesterol. All those items measured were in-range.</p>
        <p>Then we went off to do the weekly grocery shop. We also went to Whirligig and bought gifts for the grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Later I started collecting together images for a talk on fusion and after dinner ran the PEI Group meeting. Due to the delay from last week we had as many apologies as people joining.</p>
