        <h1>Wednesday 17th July</h1>
        <p>A warm and mainly sunny day. Angela went off walking with her group of friends. I think they only walked to The Hub for coffee! I caught up with a few things, including the completion of a synopsis of my planned talk on fusion and sending it to Mike W.</p>
        <p>A very sad event took place after lunch. It might well have been my last drive of the TC! Angela followed me to Milestone Classics at Wisborough Green, where I left the TC (and all its paperwork) with Jamie Crips. I should get a contract from Jamie's business partner, Tony, to sign. We agreed that he would market it at Â£22,950 and see how it goes. Again, it started easily and ran very well. We were home at about 3:30.</p>
