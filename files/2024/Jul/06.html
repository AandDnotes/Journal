        <h1>Saturday 6th July</h1>
        <p>The early rain had stopped by the time that we walked down to the High Street, but it was windy all day. I spoke with Robin, from Steyning Greening, about the workshop planned for Tuesday and we bought a few vegetables in the market. Then I bought a newspaper before we walked home.</p>
        <p>We were quite late, but I had time to do the weekly accounts before lunch. The roofing man called to check that we were expecting him on Monday. He is now planning to board-over the existing felt (only removing the edging) and then felt. We also discussed his plan to support the joists over the window. We don't need to remove the cars and probably didn't need to cover the things around the walls.</p>
        <p>Angela cut the grass and I put a coat of green 'paint' on the garden store. Then I made a small start on a Main Gear article giving an update on my efforts to tune the TC's carburettors.</p>
