        <h1>Tuesday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>Angela started by cutting the grass. I cut some high growth on next door's wisteria and then adjusted the bolts on the bin store doors. I recreated two diagrams on my 'Stick to Rudder' presentation and added my 'me' slide. I also emailed Robin Strange to say that I could give a talk, so I checked a few facts from my references. I also put some teak oil on the garden chairs.</p>
        <p>After dinner we did a little research into the memorial on which the name of Angela's Grandfather (Horace Brazil) can be found. I made some notes in Notes/Family.</p>
