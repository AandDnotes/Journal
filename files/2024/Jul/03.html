        <h1>Wednesday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going on a (shortish) walk with her walking group. I sorted out some of the things for Tuesday's workshop and then went into the garage to start fixing up plastic sheets over the things around the walls. I had to cut open the large plastic bags. Then I started nailing them up, but changed after a while to using staples.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) dinner I went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Wicked Little Letters'. It was full of profanities, but was very funny and the acting was very good.</p>
