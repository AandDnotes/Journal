        <h1>Tuesday 16th July</h1>
        <p>Angela walked down to the High Street to buy a few things and then I walked down to the Health Centre for my appointment with the physiotherapist, after being referred by Dr Bennet a year ago. He spent half an hour checking my reflexes, movement and power and concluded that my numb leg problem was probably due to vertebrae being slightly more compressed and impinging on a nerve when I sit. He suggested using a wedge cushion in the car so as to raise my bottom with respect to my knees. He asked me to go through the exercises that I do and then gave me an additional set of exercises to do at least three times a week. I need to make another appointment in 2-3 months to see if there is any improvement.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent on email and making a start on providing a synopsis of a talk to the RCEA on fusion reactors that I have agreed to do in October.</p>
