        <h1>Thursday 4th July</h1>
        <p>Not only is it US Independence Day, it is the UK general election! However, we started by going to Lidl and then Waitrose in Worthing to do our weekly grocery shop. On the way we took some books to the charity warehouse.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the Steyning Centre to vote and then walked on to the Health Centre for me to book an appointment for a blood test (I'd received an email to say that I was due one). We also booked appointments for us to have our shingles booster. My repeat prescription was not ready at the pharmacy, so I will go back tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela cleared out the garden store, while I sent out a reminder to the PEI group about next Thursday's meeting. Then I went into the garage to finish covering things up in preparation for the roof to be replaced.</p>
