        <h1>Wednesday 6th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went of walking this morning with her friends. I spent quite a lot of the day loading, transforming, editing and combining the video files from yesterday evening's talk. It is now ready for upload to our YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre for the Community Film Night. The film was 'The trouble with Jessica'. At the start it was difficult to understand some of the dialogue, but is was a funny film. </p>
