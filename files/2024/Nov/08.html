        <h1>Friday 8th November</h1>
        <p>Another grey and chilly day, but quite a busy one, or so it seemed. I got dressed before breakfast so that I could take the Panda to Simms just after 8:30. We had heard a clunking sound when we went over (some) bumps. I thought it might be a rubber bush in the suspension. Later we found that it was a loose spare wheel! Simms changed the bolt for a shorter one!</p>
        <p>After lunch, Tony turned up with a low-loader. I drove the TC up to it and he winched it on (I then drove it the last two feet). I put the spare wheel, bits that came with the car and the paperwork in the cab. The person interested in the car is coming tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>During the day I produced a template for the RCEA newsletter and drafted the entry for the visit to the Brighton ECR. I also replied to Anthony about family photos, sending him a link to my web site and to the video of Eileen's wedding.</p>
