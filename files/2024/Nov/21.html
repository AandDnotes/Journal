        <h1>Thursday 21st November</h1>
        <p>Shortly after getting up we had a snow shower! Luckily it more or less stopped before we set off to do the weekly shop, although we didn't go over the Bostal. After going to Lidl in Worthing we went into Waitrose and then walked to the library to buy some Christmas cards and the watch maker to pick up Angela's grandfather's pocket watch. Angela then bought some new knitted gloves and we bought a jigsaw in Waterstones.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did some preparation for my attendance at the Solent Network committee meeting. After dinner I joined them. It was interesting to see how they operate, although I came away with an action.</p>
        <p>I also received some comments from Paul B (he practically rewrote my draft email) and sent our request for event data to Joanne. I was surprised that she replied later and agreed to provide the data we requested. Although I'm not sure when or whether it will match our expectations.</p>
