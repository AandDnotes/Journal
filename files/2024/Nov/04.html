        <h1>Monday 4th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went to her Monday club and worked in the garden (as well as hanging out the washing), but I didn't step out of the door. Again!</p>
        <p>However, I did attend an IET Education Teams presentation on the BBC micro:bit and prepared an 'attendance' sheet for tomorrow's talk, ready to accept the list from Plus4Events.</p>
        <p>I did have a play with the Rubik's cube, completing it by following the algorithms and then messing it up so that I could practice it.</p>
        <p>We had an early dinner so that I could attend a CC-UK Roadshow. The aim was to inform volunteers about the role of the CC-UK and ask what they wanted to help them run their Local Networks.</p>
