        <h1>Saturday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>We were waiting for storm Bert to arrive today. Luckily it wasn't too windy or wet first thing when we walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. It became very wet as the day progressed.</p>
        <p>For me it was then a question of doing the weekly accounts and modifying the interest rates in my 'savings' spreadsheet from the various emails that had arrived from banks and building societies with which we have 'easy access' accounts. I also asked George W and Mike W to send me their contributions to the RCEA December newsletter. Unfortunately they sent them before the end of the day!</p>
        <p>I took a few photos of Angela's grandfather's pocket watch and found out the the £25 cost in 1951 is equivalent to £667 today!</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Victoria. Brandon is still looking for a reason to not accept the job offer from the Canadian company. He has a call with them on Tuesday. He will ask for more vacation and when they say no he will use that as the reason not to accept.</p>
