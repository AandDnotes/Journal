        <h1>Friday 1st November</h1>
        <p>I was still in my underwear, doing my exercises, when Jamie arrived to video the TC (at around 9:30). So I hurriedly dressed. We uncovered the TC, started the car and moved it into the turning point next to us. Jamie walked around the car with his phone. Then the car went back in the garage.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela was cutting the grass and tidying up the front garden. I then had another look at the KitchenAid kettle. KitchenAid replied to my query to say that they could provide a new base for Â£85! I checked the heating element and as many connections as I could access. I couldn't find any report of a similar problem. So I put it back together.</p>
        <p>I had also asked Ryobi about the problem with the drill/driver. They only said that it was out of warranty and so they wouldn't repair it. However, they referred me to a company that does repairs and provides spares. So I emailed them. I also took the drill apart and again checked the micro-switch that is activated when you switch it from driver to drill. So I put that back together as well.</p>
        <p>Later I investigated plastic sheds and free web hosting and mail servers. I was looking for those that are in the UK, but couldn't find any!</p>
