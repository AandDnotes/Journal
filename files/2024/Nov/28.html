        <h1>Thursday 28th November</h1>
        <p>We woke to a very misty morning; we certainly couldn't see the top of the Downs. And there was frost on the grass, roofs and cars (except ours, which are in the garage). It was still a bit misty when we set off for the supermarket, although we  could just about see the top of the Downs and so we decided to go over the Bostal. Actually, the top was clear and sunny and we could look down on the mist lying in the valley.</p>
        <p>This morning we went to Lyons Farm, but did things the other way around to the usual. Angela had a lot of Sainsbury's coupons, so we went there first and only bought a few remaining things in Lidl. From there we went on to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee and a look around. They had masses of cut Christmas trees as well as some in pots.</p>
        <p>A couple of the RCEA committee commented that my December newsletter did not have a Christmas image at the start. So I mocked up the front page with a downloaded, free image and sent it to them. At least a couple seemed to like it. Apple Pages will only put text over an image if the text is in a text box. But I got there in the end without extending the reach of George's 'President's Message'.</p>
        <p>I also confirmed a date for Graeme A's talk and emailed others about talks and CC-UK documents.</p>
        <p>It stayed sunny all day (after the mist had cleared), but by two o'clock the sun is behind the trees on the Bostal Road and has then set fully by four. I don't want to make time go faster, but roll on Spring.</p>
