        <h1>Saturday 30th November</h1>
        <p>A grey, calm, but warmer morning. We walked to the High Street to buy a variety of things, including some transparent silicon sealant. Angela then went off to the library.</p>
        <p>I phoned Mike U about sending an email to those who registered for the talk last week. I then sent them all an email, using the 'blind copy' facility. I had a few responses, which were all positive in various ways.</p>
        <p>Being Saturday, I did the weekly accounts and then did some more image reductions and replacement in the RCEA December newsletter.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. Brandon has accepted the job offer in Canada! They are still trying to work out their plan for getting there. They need to move out of their house in just over two weeks and the storage containers arrive next week.</p>
