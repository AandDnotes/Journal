        <h1>Sunday 17th November</h1>
        <p>I got up earlier than usual and went off just after eight to drive to Woodmancote, to Mike W's. He then drove us to the Town Hall in Lewes for the STEM fair. We were a little early, even after driving around some of the back streets in Lewes, but Ramon arrived a little after us. We set up three tables. When they opened at ten, it soon became very busy. We estimate that we did 200 LED torches, plus a few hoop gliders. The event finished at three, but I wasn't home until a little after four thirty.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church in the morning and after I got home we spoke with Paul.</p>
