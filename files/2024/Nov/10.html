        <h1>Sunday 10th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church on this Remembrance Sunday, I unpacked my tools from yesterday's Repair Cafe and then spent a lot of the rest of the day completing a draft of the newsletter notes on the RCEA visit to Brighton ECR. This involved cutting images from the scanned book pages that Derek had sent and copying the text. I sent them to Derek and, luckily, he only had a couple of minor comments. For example, I had tried to count the number of people present. But I got it wrong.</p>
        <p>I started looking up options and prices for our planned trip to Paul's over Christmas. BA seem to have stopped flying from Gatwick to Amsterdam and all the prices have gone up immensely. Later we spoke with Paul. Kitsy seems to be growing fast.</p>
