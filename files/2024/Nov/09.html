        <h1>Saturday 9th November</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the High Street to get a newspaper. It was overcast and chilly. I followed that by doing the weekly accounts, including reconciling my spreadsheet against the bank statement which arrived in the post this morning.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. It started slow, but then picked up. I re-wired a hover mower, was left a kitchen mixer to take home to look at and tried, unsuccessfully to rewire a Bosch electric mower. Andy prised apart the switch so that we could get to the connectors, but lost one of the small springs. Meanwhile, I found the section of cable that had a break and soldered the bare wires so that they could be pushed into the switch.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria just before dinner. They have accepted an offer for their house (they had several), but Brandon has still not decided whether to accept the Canadian job. He is concerned that it does not pay enough for them to save for their retirement.</p>
