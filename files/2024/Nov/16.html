        <h1>Saturday 16th November</h1>
        <p>Mid November already and the day of the Methodist Church Christmas Bazaar. We took cakes and a trifle down to the church and then I went on to buy a newspaper. Then I did the weekly accounts. I discovered that they were expecting me to sell lunch tickets, so I went back down just after eleven. The church was packed, probably due to all the members of the choir that was singing a little later. The hall was also packed, with lots of Brownies selling cup-cakes.</p>
        <p>Sale of lunch tickets was slow to start with, but picket up to the extent that it was one of the highest number. We had our lunch at two o'clock, but I did have a Brownie's cup-cake to keep me going.</p>
        <p>When we got home we spoke with Victoria. They are seeing an immigration lawyer on Tuesday. Brandon has heard nothing from 80 Acres, so if the immigration process looks straight forward then it looks as though he will accept the Canadian job. Although I think that, if he does, he will always regret not holding out for something that pays more.</p>
