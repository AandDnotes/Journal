        <h1>Saturday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>Angela was off early this morning to help tidy the garden at the church. So I went to the High Street to buy a newspaper. The rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and the monthly account, which I had to finish later in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Before we had our lunch we spoke with Victoria. It seems that quite a lot happened yesterday. Brandon got his severance pay and an offer from the Canadian company, Bowery went out of business and laid off the rest of the workforce, they have a lot of people viewing their house. In fact we had to talk to her earlier than usual because they had to go out so that another four people could view the house. Brandon sent the link to the details. Although Brandon likes the job in Canada, the salary is considerably lower than what he has been getting. However, it is a more stable company and the lifestyle looks better.</p>
