        <h1>Sunday 24th November</h1>
        <p>It was a windy, warmer and mainly dry day. While Angela went to church I replied to the Solent man in St Lucia, forwarding his email to my other LNs. Then I started putting the RCEA December newsletter together. It took a lot of time. At times Pages tends to rearrange the position of tables and images. The newsletter ended up as 19 pages and there is still the Magnus talk to add.</p>
        <p>I also started making notes for a web page about the pocket watch. Later, Angela found a lot more information (notes and photos) about Percy Hinxman.</p>
        <p>Then we spoke with Paul. Rowan had received a good report from school on how she is working. This evening Paul was still helping her complete her maths homework!</p>
