        <h1>Tuesday 5th November</h1>
        <p>Guy Fawkes Day. Angela walked to the High Street and I downloaded the attendees list for the evening IET talk. I updated it in the afternoon before printing it and charged the two camera batteries again, just to top them up, measuring their voltage as a check.</p>
        <p>During the day I started making some notes on 'event metrics'; the action that Paul and I were given at the CC-UK committee meeting.</p>
        <p>During the talk at Crawley College, the battery lasted until the last question! I arrived early and parked in the 'visitors' car park, which had plenty of room. The talk, on weather forecasting, was very good and was quite well attended.</p>
