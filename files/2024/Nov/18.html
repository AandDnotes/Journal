        <h1>Monday 18th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club, I did a variety of things in the study. I emailed each of the IET Local Networks about joining one of their committee meetings. I also filled in the IET online event feedback form, sent more details to Harriet and created the Adestra email for the next talks.</p>
        <p>Later, before dinner, I joined the CC-UK meeting. We were all asked to arrange a 'regional' Teams meeting with our LNs before Christmas so as to find out how they are planning to spend the rest of their budget and what help they might want.</p>
