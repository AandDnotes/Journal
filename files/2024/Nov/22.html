        <h1>Friday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but cold day. I started by making a list of jobs that I had to do, since there seemed to be so many. I entered our passport data for our flights to Amsterdam and bought my rail ticket and parking for Monday before, after Angela mowed the back grass and hung out washing, we walked to the Hub for coffee and on to Hyde Square to buy some items.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the front grass while I checked in to our flights (Easyjet open flights 30 days in advance) and printed our boarding passes. I also asked George and Mike for their contributions to the December RCEA newsletter.</p>
