        <h1>Tuesday 26th November</h1>
        <p>A dry and fairly sunny day, with not a lot of wind. Angela washed some woollen jumpers and went to the Hight Street to get some more cold meat. I spent the morning adding Mike W's text and images for the BP Magnus talk into the December newsletter. I's a pity that later he sent me another version!</p>
        <p>Angela had sorted out information about her ancestors, so I scanned a couple of images of her grandfather and grandmother (Hinxman) and modified names and birth/death dates on the existing Hinxman web page.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined an IET Sussex events meeting. I must email Graeme Awcock and chase a couple of other possibilities.</p>
