        <h1>Thursday 7th November</h1>
        <p>A fairly busy day. Mike W picked me up at ten past nine this morning and drove me to Rustington for the RCEA committee meeting. The only action that I picked up was to work with Mike to ensure that someone takes notes during a talk and that they then produce a writeup. I was home by 11:45.</p>
        <p>That meant that we had to do our supermarket shopping after lunch, which we did, going to Lidl and Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm. I also filled the Panda's tank with fuel. We didn't hear the 'clonking' noise once. The car goes into Simms tomorrow to investigate the cause of the noise!</p>
        <p>Having yesterday produced the video of Tuesday's talk, today I uploaded it to the IET Sussex YouTube channel.</p>
