        <h1>Friday 15th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street twice, once to take the table cloths back to the church and buy some rolls, then again to get something else (or vice versa). I emailed Dvid F-B about his CD player and what might be the problem.</p>
        <p>Just before lunch I brought the Kenwood mixer indoors and started trying to take it apart. One of the levers was seized and I had to take a hammer to it! It was revolting inside. I found that it was actually working. So I phoned the owner, saying that I would put it back together and tell her when it was back together. Which it now is, although only a little cleaner on the inside.</p>
        <p>Earlier I checked the TC's carburettors (they are still leaking a little) and covered it. Meanwhile, Angela labeled the cakes she made yesterday for tomorrow's winter fair and made some biscuits.</p>
