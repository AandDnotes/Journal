        <h1>Thursday 14th November</h1>
        <p>We went off to Lyons Farm to do our weekly supermarket shop, starting in Lidl and moving on to Sainsbury's for a few things. We then went on to Findon Vale garden centre for Angela to look again at boots and for coffee. She didn't find any boots.</p>
        <p>Although the day started damp and misty, the mist cleared and it was a sunny day. So after lunch I took the TC for an outing up through Ashurst to Partridge Green and then back down through Henfield and Small Dole. The car ran very well, although I've not yet checked the carburettors.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time searching for and looking at information about the Kenwood mixer that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. I also replied to David F-B about his faulty CD player.</p>
