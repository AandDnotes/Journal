        <h1>Monday 11th November</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and a little brighter than past days. Tony at Milestones phoned to say that the person who viewed the TC was unhappy about a 'repair to the tub', which there isn't. I can only assume that he was looking at the patches on the bottom of the side-screen box that I fitted in June. I sent an image of the panels to Tony so that he could explain to the person that he was wrong.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to the lunch club, later than usual since she was only washing up. I went later. Before we started eating I had a call from someone in Worthing who would like to view the TC! I spoke to him later and arranged that he would call in the morning.</p>
        <p>Angela then went to a table tennis session, getting back just before I went to the WSMGOC meeting.</p>
