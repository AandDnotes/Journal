        <h1>Wednesday 13th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with Felicity to join up with the rest of the walking group at Sullington Woods. Then David F-B arrived in his modern TF and we drove off to a pub just to the south of Horsham to meet up with the rest of the Sussex Wanderers.</p>
        <p>After coffee and a chat we headed south. After a little detour from Mannings Heath to Lower Beeding, we headed back along the route we had already driven, before turning off to Partridge Green. We went along the Steyning bypass, then up the Bostal Road and then down to the coast and to the Longshore for lunch.</p>
        <p>David dropped me home at about two thirty.</p>
        <p>Later I transcribed my note on the RCEA talk on the Magnus oil platform.</p>
