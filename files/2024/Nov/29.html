        <h1>Friday 29th November</h1>
        <p>The day started well. It was sunny and fairly calm. So we went for a walk to the rifle range on the way to the butchers. Although we did stop at Victoria's Sponge for a coffee.</p>
        <p>However, as we got home so Mike U phoned to say that he had received a fine for parking at the University of Sussex. I had an email from Charles M later to say that he had got one as well. It seems that the UoS started charging for parking in the evening; without telling us. So 30+ people will get a fine of Â£30!</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time emailing Mike et al about the problem, downloading the email addresses of those who registered for the talk and trying to work out how to send an email from 'Sussex'. Although I did sort out the boot of the Panda and checked the tyre pressures.</p>
        <p>Although I had planned all day to experiment with the images in the RCEA newsletter, I only had time to modify a few images.</p>
