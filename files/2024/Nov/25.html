        <h1>Monday 25th November</h1>
        <p>A much quieter day, weather-wise. In spite of storm Bert, our train to London was only a few minutes late and so our London walks group (all ten of us) met the Market Hall at Victoria.</p>
        <p>We then caught the very busy tube to Leicester Square and then followed the 'Covent Garden' walk; very slowly. I fact, we had to stop for lunch in Embankment Gardens (where we ate last time) after only about a third of the two mile walk. We continued, really only calling into the King's Chapel of the Savoy.</p>
        <p>At the end of the circular walk we decided to walk back to the pub where we planned to have dinner. We still eat quite early, but then walked on to Victoria station and caught the 7:16 train back south.</p>
        <p>While I was out, Angela went to her Monday club.</p>
