        <h1>Tuesday 19th November</h1>
        <p>A very wet day and, unusually, Angela didn't go out. I spent most of the morning doing things for the evening talk. I produced a speaker's certificate and an attendance list and finished charging batteries. I also deleted the files on the camera SD card and on the Rode microphones.</p>
        <p>I also installed Whatsapp on the iMac and the MacBook. Then I messaged Caron about the action to hold a 'regional' meeting. She said that my request to my LNs to join one of their committee meetings covered what was intended.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon (in the dark) I went to Falmer for the IET talk. It was quite well attended and an interesting talk around autonomous and connected vehicles.</p>
