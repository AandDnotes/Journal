        <h1>Wednesday 20th November</h1>
        <p>It was a dry, sunny, but cold day and while Angela was out with her walking group, I had a good conversation with Paul Broadberry of the CC-UK. We had a wide-ranging talk about our backgrounds and what our Local Networks do. Finally we got on to the subject of event metrics and agreed that I would draft an email to send to Joanne. Later I sent Paul the draft.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we reviewed our travel options for going to Berkenwoude over Christmas. The times of flights had changed and the costs had gone up! In the end we chose to fly from Gatwick to Amsterdam with Easyjet on Sunday 22nd December, returning on Sunday 29th. I also booked our parking at Gatwick.</p>
        <p>During the day I updated the OS on both Macs.</p>
