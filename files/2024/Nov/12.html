        <h1>Tuesday 12th November</h1>
        <p>Yet another busy day. Just after 9:30 Mick came to have a look at the TC. I had already run the engine for a while and pulled it out of the garage. He liked it, although was disappointed that it doesn't have the original air filter. He is planning to look at some other TCs and so 'may' be in touch.</p>
        <p>In the mean time Angela took her lunch club cash to Storrington to bank.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch, Peter W picked me up and we went to the RCEA talk at Field Place. It was an excellent talk on the building of the Magnus offshore oil platform.</p>
        <p>If that wasn't enough, after dinner I joined the IET Sussex committee meeting. Luckily it only lasted just over an hour. I need to update the list of committee members on the web page.</p>
