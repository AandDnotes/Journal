        <h1>Wednesday 27th November</h1>
        <p>It had been raining all night and was still raining this morning when we got up this morning. However, it had eased by the time that Angela went off with her walking group. Because of the weather forecast they initially planned to take the bus to Holmbush! However they decided instead to walk to the Hub.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I added the changes that Mike W had sent for the RCEA newsletter. Unfortunately some new text near the start pushed a lot of the images out of place. However, when I found out how to get them where I wanted, the pdf file was enormous and certainly too big to attach to an email. So I sent people a link to the file on Google Drive. Later I found the by selecting images at 'better' rather than 'best' I reduced the size from 38MB to 8MB! I might try creating smaller versions of each of the images, although that is quite a lot of work. The only comment so far is that I did not include a Christmas image at the start!</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre to a Greening Steyning talk about the proposed grid-scale battery storage system at Knepp. It was interesting, but not suitable for either the IET or the RCEA since the technology had not yet been specified. They had only done outline calculations for the storage capacity. Most of their presentation was about the ecology considerations.</p>
