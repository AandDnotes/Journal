        <h1>Saturday 13th April</h1>
        <p>We started, perhaps a little later than usual, with a walk to the Hight Street to buy a few items and a newspaper. Since one item was frozen, we brought that home and then walked down to Penfold Hall for the Steyning Museum coffee morning. We met Ann in Church Street and so came along too. W won a raffle prize, a tin of shortbread. It was quite warm and sunny, so we didn't need a coat.</p>
        <p>In between things, Angela did two batches of washing and I fitted a cord loop to the top of the washing line hole plug.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went off to Beeding for the Repair Cafe. I wasn't very busy, although I brought home a lamp for which I need to bypass the touch control and fit a three-wire cable so that the metal body can be earthed.</p>
