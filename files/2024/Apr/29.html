        <h1>Monday 29th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to her Monday club and I made a mock-up of a rudder, fitted my coil to it (after re-soldering one of the wires) and tested the movement. It worked, but I was disappointed with the total movement. It was smooth, but did not really move far enough. I tried moving the magnets a bit and increased the frequency from 20 times per second to 50 times per second, but it did not improve.</p>
        <p>I looked at some commercial magnetic actuators and think that I need to make the coil wider.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the High Street to see if the bookshop had a book that Rowan would like. However, it seems that they are published in the US, but don't have a UK distributor. So copies are difficult to come by. They said that some copies are available on-line, so I found one on Amazon (but not supplied by Amazon) and ordered it. In the High Street we also looked for something like a bath bomb, but didn't find any. So we will go to Brighton in the morning.</p>
        <p>Angela worked hard in the garden/garage, potting on cuttings.</p>
