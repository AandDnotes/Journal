        <h1>Saturday 6th April</h1>
        <p>Angela walked down to the High Street this morning while I stayed home in case the new light switch was delivered. So I investigated the Video Capture Device that I have for connecting the microphone into the HDMI output to the projector. I think I can test it on the TV. The switch actually came a little later while Angela was in the front and I was in the garage. I started by moving the washing line 'hole'. When it wouldn't go into the ground I discovered that I was trying to put it on top of an old 'hole' complete with a cap! So I moved it a few inches and made a new 'plug', with a white cupboard door knob on the top. The line central post is now upright. By the time I'd put some bread on to bake it was lunchtime.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, mainly about their work in the basement. Austin was off clearing 'weeds' from an area of woodland as part of his Scout Group environment work.</p>
        <p>Then I did the weekly accounts and made a start on the monthly accounts update.</p>
