        <h1>Tuesday 16th April</h1>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent completing the notes for last Thursday's PEI meeting. I also designed and produced a birthday card for Angela.</p>
        <p>In the early evening I went to Falmer for the IET Sussex talk. I had to connect the new microphones to the camera, since there was no connection into the lecture theatre audio system. It was a pity that I forgot to press the 'record' button until we were part way through the talk. Hopefully the audio has been recorded and Graeme will send me the slides. So I will try to piece it together.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the church to help serve refreshments for a talk being given by an author. I picked her up in Penlands Vale on my way home.</p>
