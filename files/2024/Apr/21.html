        <h1>Sunday 21st April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I exported the video of the talk, processed it and uploaded it to YouTube. Later, after the YouTube processing, I published it and emailed Graeme as he requested.</p>
        <p>Whilst waiting for the video to be processed I investigated travel options to the Netherlands. We are limited by Angela's need to help at the flower festival and then help with lunch club. So we decided we could go out on Tuesday 7th May and return on the 10th. Eurostar had limited return trains and was expensive. We would also need to stay over in London on the way out and on the way back. EasyJet charge for carry-on luggage, so BA turned out to be cheapest.</p>
        <p>After talking to Paul later in the afternoon I booked flights and car parking at Gatwick.</p>
