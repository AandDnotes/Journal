        <h1>Monday 1st April</h1>
        <p>Easter Monday, April Fools Day, another day without rain and quite a busy day.</p>
        <p>I started by spending the morning in the garage, cleaning as much of the underside of the TC. I found that the rear exhaust pipe bracket was loose and the nearside front damper is still leaking.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk, like yesterday's walk but a bit further, going up the other side of the Rifle Range and down to Mouse Lane. The sun came out before we got home. Later I went back in the garage and 'wiped' the TC's paintwork. Tomorrow I can wax it.</p>
