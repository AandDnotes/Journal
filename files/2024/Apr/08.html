        <h1>Monday 8th April</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Angela went off early to the church to help prepare for the lunch club. I sent a couple of emails and then tested the Video Capture Device to see if it would combine the hdmi input (from the MacBook) with the input from the microphone and output them to the TV. It won't. The hdmi output is just a loop from the hdmi input. The microphone input, however, is merged with the hdmi input and sent out on the usb output. I downloaded and installed OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to record the merged output. A small test confirmed that the microphone input had been combined with the hdmi input. To achieve what we want we need an 'audio inserter', the cheapest of which is Â£51.</p>
        <p>Then I drove Barbara to the lunch club. It was a good meal. After taking Barbara home, I walked back down and put away the tables.</p>
        <p>Later I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. The pub thought we were due next week, so it was crowded.</p>
