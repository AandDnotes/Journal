        <h1>Sunday 14th April</h1>
        <p>Not so warm today and it remained overcast, although dry. Angela went off to church and I produced the start slide for Tuesday's talk. I also made a speaker certificate, only to find that the printer had run out of the three coloured inks. It took me quite a while to get the certificate printed. I also charged the camera and microphone batteries and looked at the new microphones.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke firstly to Victoria and then to Paul. As well as looking after Alfred, the tortoise, they have a duck nesting on the edge of their drive!</p>
