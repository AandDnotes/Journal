        <h1>Thursday 25th April</h1>
        <p>A busy morning. Luckily it stopped raining before we went off to the Health Centre to have our covid booster jabs. We then went off to Worthing, stopping on the way to drop off the video camera and microphones to Dan. We started in Lidl and then went to Waitrose to buy a few items and have coffee. Then we went to a couple of banks, M&S and the nut shop. We also called into Whirlygig and bought some small items for Rowan.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried exporting just the audio clip over which I'd put images of slides in the last talk recording. But it would only export the whole audio track. So I recreated that audio clip (which was too large to email) and put it in a new folder on Dropbox. I was then able to share it with Graeme.</p>
        <p>Later I had a Teams call with Dan and Ciaran about videoing talks at UoS and possibly holding a competition.</p>
