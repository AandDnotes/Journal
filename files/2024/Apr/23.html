        <h1>Tuesday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>Another chilly, but dry day. Angela went out to pin up posters for the flower festival and I went for a haircut. Not as short as Angela would have liked, but I got him to go around twice!</p>
        <p>I finished making notes on the process I will use to try to make a coil for a magnetic actuator. Then I went in the garage and made a large spool out of cardboard.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended a Teams committee meeting.</p>
