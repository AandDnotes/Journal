        <h1>Monday 15th April</h1>
        <p>Angela got quite wet going to her Monday Club, although the day was mainly dry, with a few showers. I reconciled the bank statement against my spreadsheet and ordered some new printer inkjet cartridges. I also ordered a spool of 40 SWG enamelled copper wire with which to try making a magnetic actuator coil.</p>
        <p>After lunch I dismantled the table lamp that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. I bypassed the touch unit, but the light still did not work. So it seems that the LED bulb is broken. So I put the lamp back together, at least I hope that I've got the wiring right. I searched for that type of bulb, which are available from Screwfix.</p>
