        <h1>Thursday 11th April</h1>
        <p>Shopping day. In fact we needed to do quite a few things whilst out, both in Worthing and in Steyning.</p>
        <p>We started by going to Lidl in Worthing and then on to Waitrose to get the remaining few items and have coffee. Then we went to the HSBC bank, where Angela wanted to pay some cash into her Lunch Club account. However, they don't handle cash, so we had to go to Barclays, pay the cash into our account and later do an online transfer into the Lunch Club account.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went down to the pharmacy to get my repeat prescription (sending an email seems to work, even though you get no response) and then to make appointments in the Health Centre for our covid booster jabs. At first the receptionist said that we had to phone the team to make appointments, but then found that she could do it. Angela then went to the butchers and I went to the optician for buy some more eyelid wipes. I started using the eye drops today. I have to put a drop in my right eye four times a day.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the PEI Group meeting on Zoom. They all seem to think that these meetings are wonderful, although they haven't yet achieved my objective of resulting in more joint events. However, they do share experience and speaker names.</p>
