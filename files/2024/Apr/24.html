        <h1>Wednesday 24th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking group while I prepared the next Adestra email. There were more major changes than usual, but I submitted it for approval.</p>
        <p>Later I wound 36m of 40 SWG wire on to the spool that I made yesterday. Then I made a former for winding the coil from that wire. I left the glue on that to dry so that I can try to wind the coil tomorrow.</p>
