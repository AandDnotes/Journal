        <h1>Wednesday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>A  quieter day, with rain in the morning and a dry and reasonably bright afternoon. While Angela went walking with her friends I ordered my next batch of pills, put some wax on the TC's dashboard and fixed the 'lift the dot' on the driver's door, before doing some researched on a replacement 3-gang light switch for the sitting room.</p>
        <p>After lunch I ordered the light switch, repaired the tiny Tiger Moth and did a little more testing of currents through resistors and the coil. Angela went to the High Street to buy a few things.</p>
