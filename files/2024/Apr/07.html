        <h1>Sunday 7th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I continued with the monthly accounts. I discovered that Angela's Shawbrook ISA had been put into a (very) low interest account because I hadn't set the maturity option. It seems that the only notification is an email to log in and read a message. So I left a message asking for options. However, I also found that a bond, when it matured last year, had not been put into another bond as I thought we had asked (according to my notes). So I left another message. I checked my accounts and my bond had been reinvested.</p>
        <p>So it took me most of the morning just to do the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I fitted the new light switch in the sitting room. It was straight forward and I was quite impressed with the design and quality.</p>
        <p>Paul still has visitors (from the UK), so we agreed to talk with them on Tuesday evening. We therefore had a quiet late afternoon, although Angela produced a notice slip to give out at the lunch club tomorrow.</p>
