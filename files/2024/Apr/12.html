        <h1>Friday 12th April</h1>
        <p>It was warm and sunny this morning, so we went to Nymans. Whilst there we walked through the woods, a total of 5.6 km (according to my phone). We were home by about 1:30.</p>
        <p>I spent some time sorting out Angela's Shawbrook accounts. I created a new ISA account and a new fixed-rate bond, replying to there messages, asking them to move money into these new accounts from the matured accounts, with the excess put in our current account. I will need to wait to see if it works out.</p>
        <p>Later I collected together the tools that I need for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
