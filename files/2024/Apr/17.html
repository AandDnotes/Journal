        <h1>Wednesday 17th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went off with her walking group before I'd finished in the bathroom this morning. I retrieved the audio files (wav) from the new microphones and video files (mp4) from the camera's SD card. I ran each of the video files through Handbrake to reduce them in size and reduce the frame rate. Then I created a heading slide and started loading the audio and video files into iMovie. It took a while to align the audio file from the microphone with the audio on the video file.</p>
        <p>Both the inkjet cartridges and the spool of 40 SWG wire arrived in the post this morning.</p>
        <p>Since we will be out tomorrow morning (at SpaMedica for my cataract removal), we went to Lyons Farm after lunch to do the weekly shop. I also looked at LED bulbs in B&amp;Q. The type for the desk lamp that I brought home from the Repair Cafe only come in packs of two and they are a higher wattage than the maximum stated on the lamp.</p>
