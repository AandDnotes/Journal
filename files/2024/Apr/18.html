        <h1>Thursday 18th April</h1>
        <p>This morning we drove up to Sayers Common for me to visit SpaMedica to have the cataract in my right eye removed. The appointment was at 10:20 and I came out at 12:30. A lot of the time was spent waiting for the next stage. The operation only took about 15 minutes. I left with a transparent cover over my eye and another bottle of eye drops. I have to make an appointment with the optician next week for four weeks hence for a review. She will inform SpaMedica and they will make me an appointment for the other eye to be operated on.</p>
        <p>So the afternoon was a quiet one, mainly sitting and my sight (through the shield) improved as the day progressed. My eye felt a bit gritty, but otherwise fine.</p>
