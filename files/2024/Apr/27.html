        <h1>Saturday 27th April</h1>
        <p>It didn't rain until the early evening, so we took our usual Saturday morning walk to the High Street, where we bought a newspaper and a few other things. When we got back I did the weekly accounts while Angela did some housework.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage and wound my 40 SWG wire from the large spool on to the small spool to create a coil. I think I overdid the amount of CA that I put on to the wire periodically, but I left it to dry until after lunch. Then I broke away the cardboard sides of the spool (they had gone hard with the CA) and cut away what I could of the tape. Then I placed a washer on one side of the coil and hammered the drill bit out. Later I cleaned up the coil a little by cutting away some more of the hardened cardboard and measured the resistance as 45 ohms (I was aiming for 50).</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Austin had passed his swimming test (four lengths of the pool, including one on his back) so that he can go on the Scout camp that requires crossing water to get to the island. Otherwise it seemed to be the usual chaos, although they have booked flights to Amsterdam for the beginning of August.</p>
