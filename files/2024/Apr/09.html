        <h1>Tuesday 9th April</h1>
        <p>While Angela walked to the High Street I completed the Adestra email and, after an initial rejection, got it approved. I had to make up some words about Mike's talk. I had a call from Mike and he asked if we had a committee meeting this evening, but neither of had an invite. Later it transpired that Kosidinna had forgotten. He organised a meeting for this evening, but few attended, so he postponed it for two weeks.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the RCEA talk. The speaker wasn't that great, with slides of lots of words. But it was quite interesting.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke briefly with Paul and Rowan, before I joined the committee meeting just before they gave up.</p>
