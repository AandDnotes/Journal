        <h1>Saturday 20th April</h1>
        <p>A fairly quiet, standard Saturday, with plenty of sunshine, but with a chilly north wind. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things, then I did the weekly accounts and opened a new savings account with OakNorth, depositing Â£15,000 into it.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. As usual she did most of the talking, although she is homing in to visiting Berkenwoude in August. Then Angela cut the front grass while I completed spacing out the slides in the video of last week's talk.</p>
