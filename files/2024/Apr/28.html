        <h1>Sunday 28th April</h1>
        <p>Angela left for church while is was still raining, but, luckily, it soon stopped. I printed the signs I need for the Vintage Revival day next Sunday and then set about testing my magnetic coil.</p>
        <p>I firstly soldered the wires on to a pair of header pins and then put 5 volts across the coil. With the coil stood on its side and the magnet held in the centre, when I turned on the power, the coil rotated. Then I connected up the circuit with the Arduino. As I moved the 'stick', the coil moved in each direction. So now to see if the coil has enough power to move a rudder.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Rowan had been to the village with her friend and had lunch in the cafe. They were both now at Paul's and staying for dinner.</p>
