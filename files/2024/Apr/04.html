        <h1>Thursday 4th April</h1>
        <p>A slightly damp morning was spent going to SpaMedica at Sayers Common for my cataract pre-assessment. We arrived at 10:15 (for my 10:30 appointment), expecting everything to take about two hours. We left a little after eleven. Admittedly I missed one of the steps, but was phoned during the afternoon by a nurse to check my medical history. I now have to wait for the admin people to phone to arrange a date for the operation. The optometrist said that I needed both eyes operated on. My left eye appears fine to me because it is so much better than my right eye. The second eye will be operated on about four week after the first. That may scupper our plans to go to Berkenwoude.</p>
        <p>Although I'd had drops in my eyes to dilate my pupils, I was surprised that I could still see quite clearly. However, I did wear sunglasses on the way home. We stopped at a garden centre on the way home for coffee and to buy some mushrooms.</p>
        <p>After lunch I 'played' with modifying (to up the volume) audio files from the Rode microphone and then importing them into iMovie. It all looks feasible.</p>
