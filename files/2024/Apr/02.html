        <h1>Tuesday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>After a walk to the High Street to buy some more eyelid wipes I phoned Jamie at Milestone Classics and arranged to take the TC over there after lunch. So I spent the rest of the morning putting wax on the TC's paintwork.</p>
        <p>So after a sunny morning I drove to Beeding to get some petrol under cloudy skies. Then I went off to Wisborough Green. It was a good run apart from the shower of rain that happened just before I got there. Since I had the hood down I got a bit wet.</p>
        <p>However, when I arrived I found that Jamie had gone out and so the person there could only look over the car and take some photos of it to send to Jamie! So I then drove home. A little later it started raining and continued until after dark.</p>
