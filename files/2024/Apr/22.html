        <h1>Monday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>I had two short walks today, firstly to the opticians to make an appointment for four weeks hence, to check my cataract surgery, and secondly after lunch to return the lamp to its owner. Luckily it stayed dry, if a bit chilly.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to her Monday club this morning, then came with me to Sheep Pen Lane. Later she cut the two rear lawns. She also noticed a while later that the bird feeder containing meal worms had again disappeared! She found it on the other side of the road.</p>
        <p>I cut a one meter length of my 40 SWG wire and measured its resistance, so was able to work out what length I need to get a 100 ohm coil. I've not yet worked out how I will manage to cut that length and wind it into a coil.</p>
