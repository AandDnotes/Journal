        <h1>Tuesday 30th April</h1>
        <p>A sunny and fairly warm day. So we set off to Shoreham and caught the 700 bus to Brighton, even though we had to wait half an hour for the next three to come along!</p>
        <p>After coffee in Waterstones we went to the Lush shop and were given a demonstration of a bath bomb and some fizzy soap. Then we only bought a bath bomb and a bar of soap for Rowan, which were expensive. We then did a little grocery shopping before having lunch in M&S and then catching the bus back to Shoreham. We were home at two o'clock.</p>
        <p>Angela went out to inspect posters for the flower festival and I cleaned the plugs on the TC. I then put a little wax on the dashboard.</p>
