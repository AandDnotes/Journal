        <h1>Friday 5th April</h1>
        <p>Today was our Thursday in so far as we did our main grocery shop today. However, we started by taking a collection of things to the Greenhouse charity shop in Worthing. Unfortunately they did not want any more books and we had quite a lot, but they did take the rest, including some Camping-gaz canisters. We then went on to park in Waitrose, walked to B&amp;M to buy some bird food and to Dyas for some paper napkins for the lunch club before returning to Waitrose for coffee and to do our shop.</p>
        <p>Since workmen were about to start spreading stones on the Bostal Road, we returned via Findon Vale garden centre to get some orchid pots and compost.</p>
        <p>Later I prepared as much of the next Adestra email as possible and updated the programme of events document.</p>
