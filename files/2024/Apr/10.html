        <h1>Wednesday 10th April</h1>
        <p>A dry and bright morning. Angela went off with the walking group and I was picked up by David F-B in his modern MG TF and driven to Bolney where we met the rest of the Sussex Wanders and had coffee. Then is was a 30 mile run ending back at Bolney for lunch, which was very good. David delivered me back home at about 2:45.</p>
        <p>Angela and her friends took the bus to Shoreham and walked to Shoreham Fort.</p>
