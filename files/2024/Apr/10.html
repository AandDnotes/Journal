        <h1>Wednesday 10th April</h1>
        <p>A dry and bright morning. Angela went off with the walking group and I was picked up by David F-B in his modern MG TF and driven to Bolney where we met the rest of the Sussex Wanders and had coffee. Then is was a 30 mile run ending back at Bolney for lunch, which was very good. David delivered me back home at about 2:45.</p>
        <p>Angela and her friends took the bus to Shoreham and walked to Shoreham Fort.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I removed the nearside, rear light cluster on the Panda and replaced one of the brake bulbs that had broken. Luckily I had a spare two-element bulb. The last time I did this I discovered that, after removing two bolts, it is necessary to carefully prise the light cluster backwards to get it out of the plastic clips.</p>
