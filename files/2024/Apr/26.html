        <h1>Friday 26th April</h1>
        <p>Angela did two batches of washing and went to the butchers. I spent most of the morning writing notes on using the video camera and microphones to record talks. Luckily it stayed dry, if overcast and cold.</p>
        <p>I emailed the organiser of the Steyning Vintage Revival in May about showing the TC. It seems that they have spaces by the Star Inn.</p>
