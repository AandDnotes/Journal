        <h1>Friday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Angela's birthday, and quite an exciting day. It started with me removing my eye shield after yesterday's cataract operation. After wiping my eyelids with cooled, boiled water on the sterile gauze that I was given, I was surprised at just how good my vision was from my right eye. It is better than the left eye!</p>
        <p>Then we set off to the Old Barn garden centre, stopping at Squires to buy some asparagus (and one or two other things). We had coffee and Angela's piece of 'free' cake. Then we bought birthday cards for Rowan and Austin. When we got home (in time to make lunch) we found a package on the doorstep. Kate had warned Angela to expect a parcel today and it turned out to be a Cornish Cream Tea for two. We eat them for our pudding in the evening.</p>
        <p>A bunch of flowers was delivered just after lunch and later we also had a surprise, short FaceTime call from Rowan and Paul.</p>
        <p>Graeme Awcock sent his slides from Tuesday's talk, so I exported those that I failed to video and started to put them into the video recording.</p>
