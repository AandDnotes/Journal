        <h1>Thursday 19th December</h1>
        <p>A very sunny morning. In fact I wore sunglasses for our drive to Holmebush. Angela had seen some 'chocolate bombs' advertised in a Tesco brochure and thought that Rowan might like these. You pour hot milk over them to make a drink. In the end we bought a kit for making your own chocolate bombs.</p>
        <p>We didn't need much in the way of groceries, since we are only here for another two days before going to Paul's. So we bought all the items we needed in Tesco, but used one of the normal check-outs rather than fight with a self-scan machine. However, then, after coffee in M&amp;S I bought some needle cord dark blue trousers and we did you a machine to buy them. My 'best' black/blue trousers are starting to fray around the hems.</p>
        <p>Finally at Holmebush we went into Next and bough Krista a small scented candle to supplement her mug. We were home just after twelve.</p>
        <p>In our start to think about going away on Sunday I brought the 'carry-on' cases down from the loft. We need to wrap the small presents and do the last wash before we can start packing. However, I did select a couple of sensors and a lamp for use with the micro:bit. Rowan might like to experiment with the LEDs and sound on it.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed Paul Broadberry about meeting in the New Year to talk more about metrics.</p>
