        <h1>Sunday 1st December</h1>
        <p>A day just doing our usual things. It was mild, but rained nearly all day. Luckily I didn't need to go out. However, Angela got wet going to church.</p>
        <p>I emailed Julie H about the UoS parking problem and completed an update of the RCEA December newsletter. Reducing the size of the images only made a small difference to the size of the pdf file (6.3 MB rather than 8.2 MB). Then I did the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>Later than usual (because they were at the cinema) we spoke with Paul.</p>
