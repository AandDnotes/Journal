        <h1>Thursday 12th December</h1>
        <p>I started by modifying my write up of Frans talk with her one correction. But then today was mainly about the second (and last) Christmas dinner of the week. On another dull, cold and slightly drizzly morning we drove to Findon Manor for the RCEA Christmas lunch. It was a good three-course meal plus coffee and mince pies. Although the turkey didn't seem to have as much flavour at the lunch club's turkey. There are about 25 people there, but we were the only ones in Christmas jumpers. So there were some in a suit and tie, some in jackets and some in sweaters.</p>
        <p>On our way back from Findon we stopped at Lyons Farm to do our supermarket shop. We started in Lidl and then went into Sainsbury's for a few extra things. Then I filled the Panda with fuel. We were home at twenty past four, not wanting anything to eat (apart from a banana) for the rest of the evening.</p>
