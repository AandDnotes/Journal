        <h1>Wednesday 11th December</h1>
        <p>Another calm, cold and grey day. As usual, Angela went walking this morning, to the Hub! Admittedly by a long route, but on pavements. I created a template for the RCEA April newsletter, including the addition of an image to the header. Then I expanded my notes from yesterday's talk into some draft text. Later I emailed it to David F-B for Fran to check and to ask for some photos. They quickly replied about the text and will send photos later.</p>
        <p>A bank statement had arrived and so I reconciled it against my Accounts spreadsheet. I also emailed Victoria on her birthday and transferred money into her UK account.</p>
