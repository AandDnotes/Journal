        <h1>Thursday 26th December</h1>
        <p>Box Day, but another grey day and one during which we didn't go outside (again). Most of the morning was spent doing the jigsaw, before Greet and Wim (and Max) came for lunch. It was the traditional 'cook your own pieces of meet' affair. We didn't start until about two o'clock and so we didn't have anything later until quite late, while we were watching 'Wonka'.</p>
