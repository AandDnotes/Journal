        <h1>Monday 16th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club I walked down to Steyning to get some Euros, buy a book to read over Christmas, pick up my tablets from the pharmacy and check in the health centre about our RSV vaccination. I then listed the streets that I will pass on my way from the Stein to Brighton hospital tomorrow.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to the church to discuss tomorrow's kitchen inspection, I looked at the CC-UK actions and listed the types of IET LN events. I then tried to produce a mind map for a good practice guide on metrics. But the version of SimpleMind on the iMac would not save a map!</p>
        <p>Latter I joined the CC-UK meeting. It was fairly short, since there was only four of us.</p>
