        <h1>Wednesday 18th December</h1>
        <p>We both had quite busy days today, although it was only Angela's that involved physical effort. She went walking with her friends as usual on a Wednesday morning. They ended up in the Hub (from where she bought me a piece of fruitcake), although I think they got quite muddy in the process, even though the morning turned out bright and relatively warm. On the other hand, I just sat at the iMac, firstly to have a Teams meeting with STEM Learning for the to verify my DBS status and then for a Teams meeting about the FIRST Lego League event in February. I will be one of the judges of the project and robot design, whereas I've always been a referee before.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela went down to the Steyning Centre for a table tennis club tea and cake meeting. This time she got quite wet! I replied to an email from Mike W after doing some research on the state of hear 6 students science knowledge.</p>
        <p>During the day I managed to delete and then reinstall both SimpleMind and MS Teams so that they both now work.</p>
