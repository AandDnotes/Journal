        <h1>Friday 20th December</h1>
        <p>The sky was clear overnight and so it was chilly this morning and stayed bright until around lunchtime. Then it was raining by the end of the day. The cold didn't affect me, since I stayed inside, but Angela walked down to the High Street to buy some milk. With hindsight we should have asked the milkman to deliver a smaller number of bottles today, rather than 'pausing' delivery. My only venture outside was to go into the garage to check the tyre pressures and oil level in the Panda.</p>
        <p>I printed Christmas images on envelopes for Rowqan's, Krista's and Paul's 'cash'. Later I wrapped their other little presents.</p>
        <p>The Chichester MGOC member, who is writing an article about T-Types, sent me his draft. I replied about a couple of details. His article includes four photos of my TC, taken from the Milestone Classics web site.</p>
