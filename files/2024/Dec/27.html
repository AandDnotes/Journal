        <h1>Friday 27th December</h1>
        <p>Today I actually went outside! Just before lunch Paul moved ten wheelbarrow loads of sand down to the paddock. I simply walked up and sown, opening the gate for him. My excuse was for not doing more of the heavy lifting was that I've pulled a muscle in my back.</p>
        <p>After initially thinking that Rowan was feeling better, she spent most of the day lying on the sofa and not eating much at all. Hopefully she will feel better tomorrow, since we plan to go out for dinner.</p>
        <p>The others, Krista in particular, did quite a lot of the jigsaw puzzle. I expect that it will be completed tomorrow.</p>
        <p>As forecast, the day started quite foggy. Although it was quite calm and cold, the fog had lifted by lunch, but it stayed grey.</p>
