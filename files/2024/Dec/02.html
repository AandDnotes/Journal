        <h1>Monday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>Another day of not going out, at least for me. It was decidedly chilly and Angela went to her Monday Group, getting cold in the process. Meanwhile I downloaded the registrants for tomorrow's talk and produced a draft attendance list.</p>
        <p>Emails kept appearing associated with parking at Falmer. Deshi got a reply from the estates management company, who have passed it on to their manager. At the end of the day I sent an email to registrants, giving them an update. I phoned Ian M as requested.</p>
        <p>I put together a web page on the pocket watch and linked it from the Percy Hinxman page. Later I started investigating taking drawdown from my personal pension plan.</p>
