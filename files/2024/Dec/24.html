        <h1>Tuesday 24th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas eve and another day spent inside. It rained during the morning, but was grey all day. We didn't get up particularly early, but agin we spent a lot of time doing the jigsaw puzzle. It looks as though we'er making progress, but there are still an awful lot of pieces in the box.</p>
        <p>For the second evening running we played Scrabble and for the second evening I won!</p>
        <p>While we were playing Krista had a phone call from a friend up the road. Her husband had got a piece of metal in his eye and she had to take him to A&amp;E. She asked if their son could stay with Krista. So the kitten got moved from the grey room into Krista and Paul's room and their son went to bed in the grey room.</p>
