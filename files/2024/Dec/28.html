        <h1>Sunday 28th December</h1>
        <p>Again we were quite late up, but it was not too foggy. However, it stayed overcast and grey all day and was very cold.</p>
        <p>Rowan was still a little under the weather, although she was well enough to go out for dinner in the evening, even if she didn't eat much.</p>
        <p>The puzzle was finished (mainly by Krista) and Victoria posted a lot of photos of Niagra Falls (in the snow).</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon Paul drove us to Goede. We walked through the main square where they were skating around the building in the middle. We walked down some back alleyways to a restaurant where Krista had booked a table. There were rooms all over the place, upstairs and downstairs. The food (and wine) was expensive, but very good. We were home by 9:30.</p>
