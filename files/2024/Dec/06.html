        <h1>Friday 6th December</h1>
        <p>For the most part it was a sunny, calm and clear day, if a bit cold. I started by putting my Christmas letters into cards and writing the envelopes. Later in the day Angela took them and others down to the Post Office to post.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I went to have a haircut. It's a pity that she cut one side shorter than the other, but I will try to trim it myself. Whilst out I bought 50 2nd-class stamps for our Christmas cards. When I got home I found an email from Deshi with a response from the Estates people at the UoS. They have a greed to cancel our parking fines. So I appealed to my fine and passed on the details to the list of attendees. Before I had finished that email I received one that said my appeal had been successful.</p>
        <p>Whilst clearing out some of the accumulated email I found one from Mike W pointing out a typo in the newsletter. So I had to quickly correct it and send out the pdf file again.</p>
        <p>Finally I started writing the notes from yesterday evening's PEI group meeting. Although I only got as far as setting up the framework.</p>
        <p>All-in-all it has been a tiring day. And the next named storm (Darragh) is due this evening and overnight.</p>
