        <h1>Tuesday 31st December</h1>
        <p>New Year's Eve and the wind got stronger as the day went on. Many celebrations have been cancelled, although we didn't go out of the door. I spent some time doing the weekly accounts and setting up the spreadsheet for next year.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela got out the new jigsaw puzzle out and we set it up on the dining room table. We managed to complete the edges and then stayed up to see in the New Year.</p>
