        <h1>Saturday 7th December</h1>
        <p>A very windy day, with rain for all the morning. But it was an busy day for Angela. We went to the butchers this morning to collect the rolled turkey breasts and took it to the church to put it in the fridge. There was supposed to be someone in the kitchen, but there was not. She then went out for lunch (to the Fox at Small Dole) with the St Barnabas group. Then we went down to the Steyning Centre to the craft fair. Luckily it had stopped raining by then.</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts and managed to start filling in some of the notes of the PEI group meeting. The RCEA newsletter, my first as 'editor', was distributed today.</p>
