        <h1>Tuesday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>A bright, colder, but not frosty, and calm day. Angela went to the High Street and I spent some time trying to work out what my tax would be for this financial year, particularly with regard to drawing down money from my personal pension plan. I was surprised at the amount of interest that I 'earn', a sum that does not tally with the sum that the HMRC used for my 2022/23 tax statement (I couldn't find one for 2023/24).</p>
        <p>I phoned Standard Life, who sent me a link to an online form to set up drawdown. Later I completed the form, asking for Â£1,000 per month to be paid into our current account. This should last for about nine and a half years.</p>
        <p>I also updated the attendance list for this evening's talk and printed it off. Later in the early evening I drove to Crawley College. It was a very different talk to usual, with four speakers on the Sussex and Surrey Institute of Technology and what the UoS and UoB offer and little about technology. Once again I had difficulty starting the camera, although the battery did last until the end.</p>
