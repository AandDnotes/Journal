        <h1>Saturday 14th December</h1>
        <p>Still chilly, grey and calm, but dry. So we made our usual walk to the High Street to buy an newspaper. Then Angela hung out two batches of washing while I did the weekly accounts. I also opened a new account, moved some money into it and set up a regular, monthly transfer.</p>
        <p>We were hoping to talk with Victoria after lunch but they were busy packing, so we spoke with Paul instead. They had all been unwell, but are now better. Later I wrote out the Christmas cracker jokes and cut them into strips. I will try rolling them up.</p>
