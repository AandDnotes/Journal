        <h1>Monday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>A much more gentle day today. Neither Angela nor I went out at all. Krista went supermarket shopping and both Paul and Krista went outside to deal with the various animals. We spent quite a long time on a '1594 map of the known world' jigsaw puzzle (which has 1,500 pieces). Otherwise, we played Scrable.</p>
