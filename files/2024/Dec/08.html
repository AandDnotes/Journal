        <h1>Sunday 8th December</h1>
        <p>Still windy and wet. Angela left early for church so that she could light the oven, let it warm up and then cook the two rolled turkey breasts. She removed them from the oven to cool before se left. Later in the afternoon we went down to the High Street to see the Christmas Fair (which had only half the usual stands) and then went on to the church to slice the turkey. It only took about an hour, including cleaning up afterwards.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I received an email from Victoria saying that they were in Canada and would be driving home this afternoon. We can only guess at what they were doing.</p>
        <p>I also finished writing notes for the PEI meeting and sent them out.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Being the nearest weekend to Sinter Clause day they had Greet and Wim and Krista's Brother et al visiting for the day.</p>
