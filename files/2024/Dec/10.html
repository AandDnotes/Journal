        <h1>Tuesday 10th December</h1>
        <p>Angela made two trips to the High Street during the day. It was still chilly, but the wind had dropped. During the morning I joined the IET Education online 'catch up'. Luckily it only lasted half and hour, but was useful. I emailed our Education Officers afterwards.</p>
        <p>After a slightly early lunch I collected Peter W and we went off to Field Place for the final RCEA talk of the year. It was different to usual, being given by Fran Farrer-Brown on the subject of her B&amp;B business. She spoke without slides and I tried to make some notes for the newsletter.</p>
