        <h1>Saturday 21st December</h1>
        <p>The winter solstice, so the days should be gradually getting longer. Part of the day was spent packing for our trip tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Angela has a head-cold, so during the morning we went to the pharmacy to buy some covid test kits, just in case. Our old ones are out of date. Luckily the test was negative.</p>
