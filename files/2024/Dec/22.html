        <h1>Sunday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>We were up fairly early and left the house at eleven o'clock. It is a few years since we flew Easyjet from Gatwick north terminal. The open part of the long-stay car park was right out on the furthest edge. However, we were at the bag-drop just after it opened for our flight. The display said that our flight was delayed by 22 minutes!</p>
        <p>We got through security fairly quickly, although Angela got stopped as often happens. It was a little early, but we had some lunch in Pret. Then we had about 45 minutes before we were 'called' to the gate. We boarded the plane (there wasn't a lot of space in front of the seats) and then the pilot said that there was a 25 minute air traffic control delay. However, we only had to wait for about ten minutes before moving.</p>
        <p>We arrived at Schiphol just a little late, but we got through passport control quickly and our bags were there when we got to baggage reclaim. We decided to have a cup of tea before getting the Intercity Direct train to Rotterdam, where we caught the train to Goude, where Paul met us. Luckily Krista was able to give us some fish and chips.</p>
        <p>So everything worked as expected, but it was a very tiring day.</p>
