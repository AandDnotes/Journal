        <h1>Tuesday 17th December</h1>
        <p>We both had a busy morning this morning. Luckily it was dry, calm and fairly warm, if grey. Angela went to the church for a kitchen inspection. It went well. They now have five stars!</p>
        <p>I drove to Shoreham and caught the 700 bus to Brighton. I was in Shoreham High Street just before 9:30, so I paid Â£2 for my ticket, not wanting to chance being late. Late, that is, for my appointment at the Neurophysiology department at Brighton hospital. It took about 20 minutes to walk from the Old Stein to the hospital, but I was still early.</p>
        <p>The doctor attached small pads (with wires attached) to my right ankle and gave me electric pulses from a hand-held probe. He moved the pads several times and then did the same on my right hand. It seems that I am suffering from the deterioration of the long nerves due to age!</p>
        <p>The whole thing was done in 15 minutes and so I was able to walk back to the Old Stein to catch the bus and I was home in time to prepare lunch.</p>
        <p>While Angela was preparing dinner I made a carrot recorder. It produced a good tone until the holes were uncovered. I don't think it was long enough. We ate some of the carrot with out dinner.</p>
