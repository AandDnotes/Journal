        <h1>Wednesday 4th December</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela went walking with her friends this morning. I prepared the video files from yesterday's talk. Later I put the together to produce a recording of the talk on the Sussex &amp; Surrey Institute of Technology and uploaded it to the IET Sussex YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>I also produced my 'Christmas' letter, with notes on the modifications for each person/couple. Now I just need to print them off.</p>
        <p>There was still no response from the UoS Transport Office about our parking fines. So I asked Deshi to 'prompt' them, which he did.</p>
