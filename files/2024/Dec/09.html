        <h1>Monday 9th December</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to the church to help set up for the Christmas lunch club. I wasted most of the morning by putting past writing into a set of web pages. Wasted, because I then discovered that I had already done it over two years ago!</p>
        <p>I walked down to the church in time to have lunch. There were more people than usual, there were Christmas crackers and the meal was very good, although I probably shouldn't have had seconds! But then we had to clear up. The volunteers had done well and I only helped put things away as usual. We were home around four o'clock.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day I emailed Paul to update them on what Victoria et al had been up to.</p>
