        <h1>Thursday 5th December</h1>
        <p>The day started raining and finished raining. Luckily it had calmed by the time we left for Worthing. We went firstly to Lidl and then to Waitrose for coffee and to buy a few more things. Then we walked into Worthing. Although Angela wanted to buy some long pants and a calendar, she bought neither.</p>
        <p>After lunch I printed my Christmas letters and updated the RCEA newsletter with Glyn's comments, sending it to Mike W.</p>
        <p>After dinner I chaired the PEI Group online meeting.</p>
