        <h1>Monday 30th December</h1>
        <p>We set off to do a supermarket shop this morning, deciding to go to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm since we had a 15% voucher is spending Â£50. We went on from there to Findon Vale garden centre, for coffee and to buy a poinsettia and some hyacinth bulbs. Angela planted the bulbs when we got home.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the High Street and then to Beeding to try to buy some bulb fibre. She couldn't find any, so planted the bulbs in general purpose compost. I made some bread and checked the T-Series article that a member of the Chichester MG club has written.</p>
