        <h1>Wednesday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Day in Berkenwoude. It didn't actually rain, but the ground didn't dry up.</p>
        <p>We got up fairly late, opened our presents and had a roast lunch. During the afternoon we had a FaceTime call with Victoria et al in Niagara Falls. Rowan was a little better, but still didn't each much. She also went to bed early.</p>
