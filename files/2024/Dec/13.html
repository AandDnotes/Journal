        <h1>Friday 13th December</h1>
        <p>Another grey and chilly day. We set off to try to do the little Christmas shopping that we have to do for things to take to Paul's. We started by going to M&amp;S at Holmebush to look at their long pants (Angela bought some yesterday) and then went into Tesco to look at theirs. But they were thinner and the same price, so I bought some in M&amp;S. However, we did buy a National Trust calendar in Tesco. We then went on to Maybury garden centre for coffee and to look around. We bought Paul a little book. Then we drove to the Old Barn, forgetting that was also owned by Tates. Although they had the same things, it is bigger, they had more and we bought Krista a mug with horses on it. But still nothing for Rowan!</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela went to the butchers and I added the photos that Fran sent (after reducing them in size) to the notes on her talk.</p>
