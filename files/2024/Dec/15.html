        <h1>Sunday 15th December</h1>
        <p>Angela's day was around the other way to usual. Rather than go to church this morning, she went to a carol concert this afternoon. So we spent the morning inside, reading the paper and pottering.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I modified the web page listing my various writings over the years and then rolled up all the strips containing Christmas cracker jokes.</p>
        <p>Whilst we were eating dinner we spoke with Victoria et al, who were eating their lunch. They still had a few things to pack into the 'boxes', which were all lined up on their drive. These boxes were supposed to be picked up tomorrow, but there might be some problem with that. But on Tuesday, when they complete on the sale of their house, they are staying with friends. Then they drive to Niagra on Wednesday, where they have rented an AirB&amp;B until they move into a rented house in Canada on the 1st January. They still have a lot to sort out, including their health insurance, which, it seems, has been cancelled by Brandon's previous company.</p>
