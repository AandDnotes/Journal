        <h1>Sunday 29th December</h1>
        <p>We had an earlier than usual start since I had set my phone alarm for 6:30! After breakfast, finishing our packing and saying goodbye to Rowan and Krista, Paul drove us to Goude station. It was only just getting light. We then caught the train to Rotterdam and from there the Intercity Direct to Schiphol airport. All this went according to plan.</p>
        <p>We knew, however, that our flight to Gatwick was delayed my half an hour. But we checked our bags, went through security and passport control and stopped for a coffee. By this time our flight was delayed by an hour.</p>
        <p>Boarding started a little later than announced. In fact, going through the gate started before the plane actually arrived! So it was some time later that we actually got on the plane. Then it was announced that, due to the fog at Gatwick, our take-off slot was not for another two hours and that we would be pulling back and park somewhere. We were given a cup of water and a small snack. Part way through this wait, someone was not well and decided to leave the flight. So they had to return to the gate and then search the rows around where the person had sat to make sure that nothing had been left behind (such as a bomb).</p>
        <p>Three hours after boarding the plane we took off. After a short flight the plane obviously was staked for some while before we landed (using the automated landing system). It was a long walk from the gate (on the satellite terminal), but we were quickly through passport control and our cases came out on the carrousel straight away. We bought a quiche, some cakes and some milk in M&amp;S and then we were the only ones on the bus to the car park. We were home at about 6:30.</p>
        <p>After eating our quiche (with chips and peas) we spoke with Victoria for a while. We slept well, although Angela woke with cramp in one leg.</p>
