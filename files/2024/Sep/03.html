        <h1>Tuesday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>We left home at 11 o'clock and arrived at the hotel in Sudbury (after a few wrong turns) at about three o'clock. As we got out of the car so Kate pulled into the car park!</p>
        <p>We checked in to find that Angela and I were in the 'cottage', which is separate from the main hotel and in the car park. The hotel is full with a coach party. We met up for a cup of tea on the terrace and then met again later for dinner.</p>
