        <h1>Thursday 5th September</h1>
        <p>After breakfast, Angela and I walked into Sudbury centre to look at the weekly market. It was quite small, however, we looked at other streets in the centre and walked back along a different route, including a small lane.</p>
        <p>Then we all set off to Lavingham Guildhall, run by the National Trust. It was interesting and we had a fire evacuation drill. We then went on to Melford Manor house. We started with lunch and then toured the house and garden. We were back at the hotel by about four. We looked at our route for tomorrow to visit Antony and Jill in Snape and then met up with Kate and Dick in the bar to look at photos. Then we went into the restaurant. We were the last to leave at 9:30.</p>
