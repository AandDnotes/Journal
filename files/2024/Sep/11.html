        <h1>Wednesday 11th September</h1>
        <p>To our surprise it was a clear blue sky, but windy and quite cool. I got up early so that I could take the Panda to Simms for its service and MoT. Angela went off to meet her walking group friends. They walked around the lower horseshoe.</p>
        <p>A little later I was picked up by David F-B in his MGF to go off to Keymer to meet up with the Sussex Wanders. David was late because he didn't know that the Long Furlong was closed. However, we were not that late arriving at the Thatched Inn, where we had coffee. I told them about the road closure on the planned route and so Stuart Penfound, who had devised the route, found a diversion.</p>
        <p>David and I missed a turn and so got a bit lost. We used Google maps on David's phone to find our way back on to the route. We finished back at the Thatched Inn for lunch, which was very good, but much too big. We left early since David needed to go out. I was home at about 2:30 and it was a bit later that I got a call from Simms to say that the Panda was ready. So I walked down to collect it.</p>
