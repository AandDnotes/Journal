        <h1>Thursday 12th September</h1>
        <p>We were surprised to wake up to a clear blue sky, but with quite a cold wind. The cloud built up during the day and in the afternoon there were some shows. But it was clear again around sunset.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday we went off to do our weekly grocery shop. Actually our list was smaller than usual since we last shopped on Saturday, having returned from Sudbury on Friday. We started at Lidl in Worthing (which was very quiet) and then went to Waitrose to buy custard powder. Actually we also bought some plants and had coffee.</p>
        <p>Then we went to a hearing specialist shop and ordered a box to plug into the TV that should send the sound, via bluetooth, to Angela's hearing aids (hopefully). We went into B&M to get some bulbs and to Dyas to get a squeegee and a new bulb for the oven.</p>
        <p>Angela spent time after lunch planting her newly bought plants, while I fitted the bulb in the oven, put ingredients in the bread-maker and unpacked the two 'light sticks' that I had ordered on Tuesday.</p>
