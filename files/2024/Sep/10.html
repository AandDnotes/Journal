        <h1>Tuesday 10th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off on the bus to Storrington to pay some of the lunch club money into the bank.</p>
        <p>Just before lunchtime I attended an IET Education training session. It was quite useful, particularly seeing the 'light stick' that I was able to order from the IET Marketing Toolkit. I actually ordered two for the Sussex Network and then emailed our EOs and Mike W to say what I'd done.</p>
        <p>Shortly after that, I went to the dentist to have a broken tooth prepared for a crown. After a couple of injections the dentist created a 3-D model of my teeth using a scanner wand. After removing the outside of the tooth she took another scan and they were sent off to the laboratory for the crown to be 3-D printed. Finally, a temporary crown was put over the tooth. Later in the evening the temporary crown seemed to be loose!</p>
        <p>Angela cut all the grass.</p>
