        <h1>Sunday 29th September</h1>
        <p>Today was Harvest Festival at church and Angela was staying there for lunch. She took a tiramisu for desert. So I had to get my own meal (a ham salad), but had some tiramisu left over from yesterday.</p>
        <p>Prior to that, I made some bread (at least I put the ingredients in the bread maker) and checked the tyre pressures on the Panda. Then I deleted the old files on the microphones and on the camera. I also made a short recording to check that the audio from the microphones was recorded on the camera.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did my Dutch lessons, but got so much wrong that I ended the week in the demotion zone!</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Paul. They had all beed a little ill. Rowan had taken Wednesday and Thursday off school and had to come home early on Friday. Their only real news was that Paul had now been with Cool Blue for ten years and they had a new aquarium for Lucy, the axolotl.</p>
