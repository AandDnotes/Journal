        <h1>Saturday 28th September</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but chilly start to the day. In fact it stayed sunny all day. As usual we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper. It is a pity that it contained the magazine from a different paper.</p>
        <p>Also as usual on a Saturday morning I did the weekly accounts. The I examined the IET's video camera and microphones, charging the batteries, deleting the old audio files and testing one of the microphones.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They were preparing for Junipers birthday party (her birthday was on Monday). They were expecting nine girls, some of them staying over night. A lot of the rest of the day was spent reading the paper.</p>
