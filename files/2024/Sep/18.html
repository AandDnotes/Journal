        <h1>Wednesday 18th September</h1>
        <p>I started by phoning the health centre to try to make an appointment. To my surprise I could have had one in 20 minutes, but I was still in my dressing gown and hadn't used the bathroom, so I settled for one at 9:30. Dr Jain was running half an hour late eve at that time, but she said that the raised spot was the same as had happened before and that I could either go to Southlands dermatology or she could simply prescribe the same cream. So we did that. Unfortunately the pharmacy did not have any, so have ordered it for collection tomorrow.</p>
        <p>While I was out, Angela went walking with her friends and was back just in time for lunch. Meanwhile, I painted the ends of the hanging basket brackets and then found an exploded diagram of the bread maker that I brought home from the Repair Cafe and a video of taking it apart. However, it was quite some effort to get it all apart. I found that one of the two heat fuses had blown. Later I told the owner that I could order a fuse and solder it in place of the faulty one.</p>
        <p>I also set the maturity option for a maturing ISA, booked a haircut and replied to Caron Malone about a chat on the CC-UK.</p>
