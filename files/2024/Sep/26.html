        <h1>Thursday 26th September</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by driving to Lyons Farm, initially to Lidl and then to Sainsbury's. We got to Findon Vale garden centre quite late for coffee and got home just in time to prepare lunch.</p>
        <p>Later we walked to the health centre, but there was only one day still available for flu/covid jabs and Angela can't make that day. So I picked up my repeat prescription and spoke to the pharmacist about the the medication for my scalp. But he didn't know how to get the film off.</p>
        <p>Later still I had a quick walk down to the Coop to get some icing sugar. Angela had been baking cakes for the coffee morning tomorrow and had run out. Dan called while we were preparing dinner to leave the video camera.</p>
