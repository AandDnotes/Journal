        <h1>Monday 9th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to help prepare and cook for the lunch club. I added our visit to Bury St Edmunds to my Suffolk web page. Then, just before midday (and after a heavy rain shower) I went to Phylis's to collect her trifles. Then it was lunch and help clear up.</p>
        <p>When we got home I added our trip to Sudbury to my web page. Then later I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. It was an 'Alternative marques' meeting, but our Panda was not voted 'best car'. However, I did win an MG key ring in the raffle.</p>
