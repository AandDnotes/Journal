        <h1>Monday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club I finished drafting a write-up of Chris R's talk on Bloodhound LSR to the RCEA. This took all morning, apart from making some bread, and later I sent it to Mike W for comment.</p>
        <p>Another job was to look at my cordless drill, to see why it was only working at 'driver' speed, even when set on drill and hammer. The batteries seem fine, with a good voltage and I was able to get the case apart. I was a little surprised to find that the mode selection actually just closes a microswitch. If that switch had failed it would have produced the symptoms seen. However, once I'd removed the coating over the soldered connections, the switch seemed to be fine. So I left a message on the Ryobi web site. I had to give the date when I'd bought the drill, so had to search in the Journal repository on github. It took a while to work out how to do this.</p>
