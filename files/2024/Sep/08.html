        <h1>Sunday 8th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went to church while I updated the weekly accounts with yesterday's purchases. I also paid for the Panda's road tax and put the cases back in the loft. Angela then went on to the High Street car park to help on the St Barnabas stand in the Steyning Food Festival event. I went down, after a heavy rain shower, to have a look and to bring back the frozen chicken for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>I stayed dry on my walk to and from the High Street, but Angela got caught in a heavy shower and got very wet. I made a start on putting together a web page for our trips to Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Rowan was at the birthday party of a new friend from school and is going on the school camp for three days next week.</p>
