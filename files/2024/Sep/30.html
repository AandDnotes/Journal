        <h1>Monday 30th September</h1>
        <p>Luckily the rain stopped before we needed to do anything, then it was a quite a busy day. Angela started by going to the church to tell anyone who arrived for the Monday club that it was cancelled because most of the members were going to a funeral. Then we had planned a day in Worthing.</p>
        <p>We failed to find any street parking within walking distance of the centre, so parked in the multi-story car park by the Gillboune Centre. We then started by taking some of the jewellery that Angela had inherited from her mother and from Bay into Whibly's, the jeweller on the corner of Warwick Street. They were interested in some of the items (not the pearls), but needed to test some that were not hallmarked. We left the items with them and went off to M&amp;S for lunch. They phoned while we were there, offering us, to our surprise, over Â£1,400. This is being transferred into our Barclays account. We also took Angela's Grandfather's pocket watch into Wheelers in the Royal Arcade. They are interested in it, but couldn't value it until 'his dad' was back tomorrow. We left it with them.</p>
        <p>We confirmed that Angela had the 20% off clothing voucher on her SPARKS card, but couldn't find any shirts in the Worthing M&S. I bought two shirts and Angela bought a fleece in Edinburgh Woollen Mill and then we drove to M&amp;S at Holmebush. We bought quite a lot, but got our 20% off. We didn't get home until 4:30.</p>
