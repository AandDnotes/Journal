        <h1>Tuesday 24th September</h1>
        <p>This morning was mainly about coffee and cake. After Angela had popped to the High Street we went to the village hall in Ashurst for the St Barnabas coffee morning. It was very popular, even though tickets were quite expensive. We sat with Sue from up the road and some of her friends. We didn't win any raffle prizes, but we each had two cups of coffee and two pieces of cake! Consequently we had a late lunch and missed out the cake.</p>
        <p>I sent my draft notes on the last RCEA talk to Mike W for comment. He later sent me some additional comment. After dinner I joined the IET Sussex Network committee meeting.</p>
