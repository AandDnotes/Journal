        <h1>Saturday 7th September</h1>
        <p>We had a later start than usual. Since Angela had to buy food for the lunch club on Monday, she tried to contact Phylis to see how many people are expected. She phoned and then went down to the market, but couldn't find her. So she guessed at the numbers. While waiting, she put on a load of washing and I made my first pass at the weekly accounts, so we didn't get off to do our weekly shop and the lunch club shop until quite late. We went to the new Lidl at Lyons Farm and then went into Sainsbury's to get the rest. After filling the Panda with fuel we were home just after 1:30, although Angela took the frozen chicken and vegetables down to the church freeze, while I unpacked the shopping and started making lunch.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we spoke with Victoria. After their first week back at school, Austin seems to be dealing well with his plaster cast. The rest of the afternoon was spent reading the paper, although Angela did put on a second load of washing.</p>
