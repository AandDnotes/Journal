        <h1>Monday 16th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club I removed two hanging basket brackets from the garage and scraped/brushed them to remove surface rust. I then made up some rust treatment solution and left half of each bracket submerged. After lunch I put the other half in the solution.</p>
        <p>I then looked further at the kettle that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. I removed the bottom of the kettle again and cleaned all the contacts, with emery paper and cleaner spray. Then I opened the bottom of the base. There are three PCBs and the temperature lever moves a variable resistor and, somehow, changes when the kettle turns off. I left a question on the Kitchen Aid web site, since I can't find any description of what the flashing lights and beeps means.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden and I added a slide to my fusion presentation about 'cold fusion' and checked through the slides.</p>
