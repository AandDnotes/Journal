        <h1>Friday 27th September</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier than usual. Luckily the rain had stopped by the time we walked down to the Methodist church to set up for the MacMillan coffee morning, scheduled for 10-12. There didn't seem to be that many people, perhaps due to the intermittent rain, but Angela made about the same amount as previous years. After clearing up we were home for a very slightly later lunch.</p>
        <p>While Angela counted her money and went out to retrieve her posters, I prepared a speaker certificate for next week's talk.</p>
        <p>After dinner the owner of the bread maker called to collect it. She paid me for the thermal fuse and left an envelope with a donation for the Repair Cafe.</p>
