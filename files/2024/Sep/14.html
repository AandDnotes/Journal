        <h1>Saturday 14th September</h1>
        <p>Another sunny, but initially chilly day. We made our usual trip to the High Street to buy a newspaper (and a few other things). Then it was a case of updating the accounts and reconciling then against the bank statement, which covered our period in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was time to go to the Repair Cafe. There were only three of us on the electrical bench, so we were busy throughout and I brought a kettle and a bread maker home to look at.</p>
        <p>We spent the evening watching the Last Night of the Proms.</p>
