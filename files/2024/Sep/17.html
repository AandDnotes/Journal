        <h1>Tuesday 17th September</h1>
        <p>I started the morning by making a follow-up appointment with the physiotherapist and emailing the prescription team about my regular tablets. They replied later, saying that they were already set to repeat every three months until August 2025. But I can't see any indication of that on the slip that comes with the prescription. I also tried to make an appointment to see the doctor about the growth on my scalp, but they are only doing same-day appointments. Meanwhile, Angela started doing housework!</p>
        <p>I removed the hanging basket brackets fro the rust remover solution and, a little later, gave each a coat of Hammerite paint. All, that is, apart from an inch at the end that was held in the vice. I had hoped to paint that bit later int he day, but it was still a little 'tacky', so it will have to be done in the morning.</p>
        <p>In between things I updated the OS on the iMac. It is now on Sequoia 15.0.</p>
        <p> Peter W collected me after lunch and drove to Field Place for the RCEA talk. It was the AGM first (so I am now officially a member of the committee), followed by a presentation by Chris Richard about Bloodhound SSC. He basically showed a number of videos. It was interesting, but lacked detail.</p>
