        <h1>Friday 6th September</h1>
        <p>We left Sudbury this morning and headed further east to visit Tony and Jill. We travelled the whole of the one and a half hour journey on B roads, only making one wrong turn. We left Snape a little after 2:30 and followed the A12 all the way to the M25, arriving home at six o'clock. Our only stop was for a short comfort break at Clacket Lane services. Luckily, all the traffic queues were on the other side of the road.</p>
