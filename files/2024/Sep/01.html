        <h1>Sunday 1st September</h1>
        <p>The first day of meteorological autumn, but it was hot and mainly sunny. We got up a little earlier than usual and drove to the gliding club in Storrington to hep with the start of the South Downs Run. A lot of participants had already arrived when we got there at then to nine (we were on from 9 till 11). It seems that they could arrive at 8:30 and needed to leave by ten. Some were a little later getting away. Angela helped in the club house, serving coffee and I helped marshal. It was a much better location than Whiteways Lodge.</p>
        <p>We were home at about 11:30. Angela pruned the espalier apple tree and pottered int he garden. I examined our route on Tuesday to Sudbury and printed some instructions from Google Maps.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started on the monthly accounts, but didn't get all that far, since I had to amend my 'how to' page when I found that I hadn't described the actions properly or had missed some completely. Later we spoke with Paul, hearing about Rowan's first week at secondary school and seeing their new kitten, called kitzu (Japanese for orange).</p>
