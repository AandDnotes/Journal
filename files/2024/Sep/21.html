        <h1>Saturday 21st September</h1>
        <p>I had trouble trying to remove the 'film' on my scalp. After using hot water, Angela applied a new coat of liquid.</p>
        <p>We walked to the High Street as usual this morning, but in the rain, so we were under umbrellas. Later I did the weekly accounts and started putting together notes on Chris R's talk.</p>
        <p>The rain stopped around lunch time and it was warm and sunny for the rest of the day. So a little later I put the hanging basket brackets back on the garage walls. I had to drill new holes for the one where a screw had broken.</p>
        <p>I also ordered an Amazon gift card for Juniper, which should arrive tomorrow.</p>
