        <h1>Monday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club (and to the Coop) I brought the small cases down from the loft, payed for two crossings at Dartford and completed the monthly accounts. Later I packed my case and Angela made another trip to the High Street. I added just a little to my web page on our finance spreadsheets.</p>
