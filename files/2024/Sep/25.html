        <h1>Wednesday 25th September</h1>
        <p>Angela went walking with her friends, managing to miss the heavy rain shower. Meanwhile I added Mike W's comments to the notes on the Bloodhound talk and sent it to Chris for checking. He replied later with some comments.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the dentist to have my new (metal) crown fitted. It didn't take very long at all and the fit was good.</p>
        <p>The new thermal fuse arrived in the post this morning and so I fitted it this afternoon to the bread maker. It was quite difficult crimp it in place, but I managed to get it firmly connected. When plugged in, the display came on, which is all I can test.</p>
