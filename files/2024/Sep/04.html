        <h1>Wednesday 4th September</h1>
        <p>Today was all about exploring Sudbury. Angela and I walked around part of the meadow before breakfast and then we met up to walk into the town centre. Dick is very slow. We had coffee in the arts centre (in an old church) and then lunch in the Gainsborough House museum. Dinner was again in the hotel restaurant.</p>
