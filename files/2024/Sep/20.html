        <h1>Friday 20th September</h1>
        <p>I went to the High Street to have my hair cut this morning and Angela cut the grass due to the forecast of rain in the coming days. It was also time to draft the Adestra email, even though we had no second talk arranged. Later, Mike U said that he would give a talk on the evolution of hardware from 1G to 6G.</p>
        <p>We tried the TV box again and I discovered that, while tidying the wiring I had unplugged the optical cable and plugged it in to the wrong socket. So the box worked well, without needing to pair the hearing aids each time the power is turned on.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela went to the hygienist, I had a Zoom chat with Caron Malone, chair of the CC-UK. It seems that I'm now a member for the next three years!</p>
        <p>During the day I managed to also finish painting the hanging basket brackets and I was surprised to receive the thermal fuse that I'd ordered, although there was only one, when the picture had shown two. But I only need one.</p>
