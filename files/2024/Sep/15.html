        <h1>Sunday 15th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I investigated the kettle that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. I found a YouTube video of someone taking the kettle apart. It's a pity that the audio was in Russian! I removed the base of the kettle, checked the element and replaced the heat transfer compound between the kettle base and the bi-metal switches. However, although the lights come on, the kettle does not start heating.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul.</p>
