        <h1>Friday 13th September</h1>
        <p>A sunny day from rise to set, but with a cool breeze.</p>
        <p>Angela needed to go to the library, so we walked to the High Street to buy a birthday card for Juniper and then to the library before walking down to the river and to the Hub in Beeding. After coffee we walked across the fields to the Downs Link and up through Clays field. We left home at ten and arrived back a little after 12:30.</p>
        <p>Angela did some weeding and snipping in the front garden, while I put my tools together for tomorrow's Repair Cafe and lubricated the little window in our bedroom. I also watched a recording of an IET Northern California talk on video/communications/technology jargon.</p>
        <p>Later I called Alan. He was putting things in his van (now with windows and an awning) prior to going off to Suffolk for two nights with Chris and the dog on Tuesday.</p>
