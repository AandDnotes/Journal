        <h1>Thursday 19th September</h1>
        <p>Before we went off to do the weekly shop I put a second coat of Hammerite on the main part of the brackets. Then we went to Lidl for the shopping, Waitrose for the coffee and the hearing shop to pick up the TV box. We stopped at B&amp;Q to buy some plants.</p>
        <p>Later I walked to the pharmacy to collect the medication for my scalp. It seems that it is a liquid that dries as a film, which has to be peeled off the next day. I have to apply it daily for 12 weeks!</p>
        <p>We tested the new TV box. Angela's hearing aids paired with the box, she switched to the new programme and could hear the TV. However, when we tried later in the evening, the hearing aids paired, but the box broke communication either before or just after Angela had changed programme.</p>
        <p>Earlier I ordered the thermal fuse needed for the bread maker and called the owner of the kettle to give him an update.</p>
