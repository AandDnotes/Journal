        <h1>Sunday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I submitted my Adestra email and then attempted to fix the bread maker. I say attempt because I should have realised that the heat from the soldering iron would 'blow' the new thermal fuse. So I worked out how I could crimp the fuse into the circuit and ordered another one. So the machine is back in the garage, again in one piece, for now.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then Paul.</p>
