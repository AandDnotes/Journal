        <h1>Friday 9th February</h1>
        <p>I didn't get up quite so early this morning. Angela started the day by going down to the church to wait for the delivery of a new fridge/freezer. It arrived just before she got there, so she spent some time helping to clean parts of the kitchen. Meanwhile, I put together the video of Tuesday's talk. Later in the day I uploaded it to the IET Sussex YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>Apart from putting some tools together for tomorrow's Repair Cafe, I did some more research about proportional control of magnetic actuators.</p>
