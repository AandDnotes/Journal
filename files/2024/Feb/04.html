        <h1>Sunday 4th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I made a cover for the outside kitchen drain from one side of the plastic bin of an old paper shredder (destined for the tip). Luckily it was dry and quite mild.</p>
        <p>There is an IET talk on Tuesday and so I produced a start slide and sent it to Greg. He had already sent one to the speaker!</p>
        <p>After lunch I managed to remove the receiver from the plane. I removed the motor connector, shortened the pins and re-soldered it on to the receiver. Unfortunately it made no difference. The motor still runs when the battery is plugged in and it doesn't change when the motor stick is moved. I also discovered that the model is an RX42-D (the D represents the Spektrum version) rather than an RX14. I did a bit of a search, but they only seem to be available from the US or China.</p>
        <p>We also had a chat with Paul. Rowan was at her cousin's.</p>
