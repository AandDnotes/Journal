        <h1>Sunday 25th February</h1>
        <p>Angela was out for most of the day. I was bright this morning, but started raining around lunchtime and continued to do so. She went to the church service and then stayed on for lunch and a church meeting. It was after four before she got home (in the rain).</p>
        <p>I found a YouTube video on how to remove the battery in an electric toothbrush, in fact the same model that was in the 'tip' box in the garage. So I took it apart and removed the coil in its base. I then soldered two strip-board pins to the ends of the coil and made up a pair of wires that will connect it to a prototyping board. I also tracked down the Arduino sketches that I used for my prototype transmitter/receiver.</p>
        <p>Later, just before dinner, we spoke to Paul et al. They had been out to Madurodam, a miniature version of the major Nederlands areas.</p>
