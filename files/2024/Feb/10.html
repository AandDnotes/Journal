        <h1>Saturday 10th February</h1>
        <p>After a walk to the High Street to buy a few things, including a paper, Angela stopped off at the church to unpack the new fridge/freezer. I came hoe and did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drove to Beeding for the Repair Cafe. Angela cam along so that she could walk back to the church to turn on the fridge/freezer. After fixing a plug adaptor I spent most of my time trying to find out why an 'industrial' toaster would not work. The cover had already been taken off, but after removing some panels I came to the conclusion that two of the heater panels (the middle one on each side) had broken. Then I started looking at a portable radio that had stopped working. I brought it home to investigate it further.</p>
        <p>When I got home we had a short chat with Victoria.</p>
