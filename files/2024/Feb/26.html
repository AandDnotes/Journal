        <h1>Monday 26th February</h1>
        <p>Not the day that I had expected! There was bad weather over night and so this morning there was traffic disruption due to flooding and fallen trees, but, more important to us, there were two points failures on the line between Shoreham and Victoria, one near Hove and one near Croydon. Consequently, all the Littlehampton to Victoria trains were cancelled. So our 'London Walk' was cancelled.</p>
        <p>Angela went to her usual Monday club, taking the car so as to give Shiela a lift. I applied for a refund of both my train tickets and parking, but it will take a while to get the money back. Then I 'played' with my magnetic actuator project. I removed what I thought was a 'stick' from an old controller, but it turned out to be various on/off contacts. I also refreshed my memory on the Arduino interface to the controller sticks and downloaded the latest version of the Arduino IDE.</p>
        <p>I had been tracking the progress of my new receiver for the tiny TM. I was impressed by the tracking details and surprised when it arrived this morning. Now i have to transfer the battery connection and add a 'plug' for the motor.</p>
