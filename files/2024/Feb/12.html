        <h1>Monday 12th February</h1>
        <p>I spent part of the morning preparing and submitting the next Adestra email to advertise upcoming talks. It was approved within a couple of hours.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the church to help with the lunch club and I went down for lunch a little later. When we got home (after clearing up) I went to Joe's to collect the radio. It seems that the volume control also had a small on/off contact underneath, which was dirty. So It now works.</p>
        <p>Later I went to the WSMGOC meeting.</p>
