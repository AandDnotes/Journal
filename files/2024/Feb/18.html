        <h1>Sunday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Rain turned to a warm, sunny day, if a little breezy. Angela went to church and I finished my tiny TM article and sent a link to it to Grahame Pearson. In fact I later had to send it again over three email. I also found a bank statement that I had not checked, so I reconciled it against my accounts spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Later, after Angela did some work in the garden, we spoke with Paul and Rowan. She is on holiday for the next week and it seems that her birthday will be during her next holiday. So she invited us to her birthday party.</p>
