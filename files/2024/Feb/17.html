        <h1>Saturday 17th February</h1>
        <p>Our usual Saturday morning walk to the High Street was in a very slight drizzle this morning. The weather became brighter, but didn't really dry the ground and rained in the evening.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a chat with Victoria. Then I started converting my web page on the tiny Tiger Moth into an article for Flypaper. Angela went to the library.</p>
