        <h1>Saturday 24th February</h1>
        <p>When we got up the sky was clear and the sun was shining. By the time we'd had breakfast and were ready to go out, it was raining heavily. However, the rain was lighter by the time we went out to buy a newspaper. Umbrellas kept us dry. I did the weekly accounts when we got home (after reading some of the paper).</p>
        <p>After Angela went to a memorial service at St Andrews we spoke to Victoria, or as usual, she spoke to us. That meant a rush to cook dinner before a TV programme that we wanted to watch.</p>
