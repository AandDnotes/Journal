        <h1>Tuesday 27th February</h1>
        <p>It was cold, but the sun shone for most of the day. I went with Angela to the High Street to buy one of two things and we stopped at Victoria's Sponge for coffee. So it was nearly lunchtime by the time we got home. It was a good short walk.</p>
        <p>I soldered the battery and motor connections to the new receiver, connected it up and checked that it all worked (although two of my servo wire labels were wrong and I had to change them). Then I fitted a new propeller and installed the receiver. Now I have to try to get the plane back in one piece.</p>
        <p>I spent some time trying to find out how easy (or difficult) it is to separate the MG's bonnet pieces, but with little success. Although I did find out how the top panels connect to the central stainless steel strip. I also ordered my meal for the March Wanderers run.</p>
