        <h1>Thursday 8th February</h1>
        <p>An early start. In fact I woke at around five o'clock and didn't really get back to sleep. So I got up at 5:45 (having set the alarm for 6am) and left for Gatwick. The FIRST Lego League Sussex heat took place in the STEM Centre at Gatwick Airport. I had expected heavy traffic, but there were no queues and so I got there half an hour early.</p>
        <p>It was a fun, but tiring day. I was involved in the refereeing of the Robot Game, but four schools had pulled out, so we had plenty of volunteers. Use of the 'Short Stay' car park cost Â£50, but we were given a QR code to pay it. I left the car park at around three and was home just before four.</p>
        <p>It was raining on my journey there and it was raining on my journey home.</p>
