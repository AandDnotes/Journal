        <h1>Sunday 11th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I removed the pcb from the radio that I brought home from the Repair Cafe. I couldn't see any damage and, although power was getting to the pcb, it didn't seem to get to the IC. So I Messaged the Repair Cafe team to see if someone could look at it. Joe thought it was an old radio that a friend might be able to fix, however, he said he would have a look at it. Later he messaged to say that he had fixed it!</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul.</p>
