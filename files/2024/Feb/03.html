        <h1>Saturday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>The market was in the car park this morning, but we only took a couple of items to put int he recycling bins. Then, as usual, we bought a newspaper. It was a grey, mild, but reasonably calm day.</p>
        <p>Whilst I did the weekly accounts and started the monthly accounts, Angela put on another batch of washing and noticed that the drain outside the kitchen was filling up. So after lunch I bailed out as much water as I could and then put my arm down and scooped out a collection of leaves and grit. I then lifted the drain cover outside the garage and flushed water through the drain. It all seemed to be clear. However, I need to make a cover that will stop debris going down the drain.</p>
        <p>Victoria called just as we were coming in and then spent an hour talking to us. Then I finished the monthly accounts, actually the recording of dividend payments. After dinner I read the first of Feynman's lectures on quantum theory.</p>
