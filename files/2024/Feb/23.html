        <h1>Friday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>A dry day after yesterday's rain. In fact, it was sunny at first this morning. So we went for a walk, having coffee at the Hub.</p>
        <p>Later I generated the next Adestra email and submitted it for approval. I then sent a copy of the draft to Mark C and to Daniel Eastwood, the email to the latter with details of registration.</p>
