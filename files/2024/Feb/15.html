        <h1>Thursday 15th February</h1>
        <p>The rain had gone and it was sunny for most of the day. It was also a busier day than yesterday. We started by doing the weekly shop at Lyons Farm and then went on towards Highdown Gardens. The traffic through some roadworks nearby caused us to go into a garden centre for coffee. Angela bought a fleece and a coat there before we went on to Highdown. We decided to go there because it was said to be a good place to see snowdrops. Clumps were distributed throughout the gardens.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we introduced ourselves to our new neighbours, Katie and Tamsin. They came in for a cup of tea. Katie is a school bursar and Tamsin is a paramedic.  They were married a year ago!</p>
