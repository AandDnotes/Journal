        <h1>Thursday 29th February</h1>
        <p>Leap year day! But for us it was supermarket shopping day. While Angela started the shopping I went to B&amp;Q to get some cable clips and then into Curry's to exchange the paper shredder. The assistant put about four sheets through and it worked, but then the motor wouldn't turn off. So I came away with a new one.</p>
        <p>After lunch I made some bread and made the battery compartment door close on the tiny TM. Then I did a bit more research into driving a magnetic actuator, converting PMW outputs (to servos) to signals for an actuator.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined Dan H on a Teams call with three students from the University of Sussex.</p>
