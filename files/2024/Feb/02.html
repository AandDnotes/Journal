        <h1>Friday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>Since we were out yesterday, we did our weekly supermarket run this morning. We went to Sainsbury's and then on to the Old Barn garden centre, since Angela wanted to get some plug plants. I also bought a back pack in their sale, one with outside pockets.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the SRFC club night about the D-Day 50th anniversary glider fly-past at Portsmouth (30 years ago). The speaker was flying one of the gliders (the only British glider of the 18).</p>
