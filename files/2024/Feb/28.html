        <h1>Wednesday 28th February</h1>
        <p>The morning seemed to disappear dealing with email and doing this and that, including trying to login (and failing) to my Close Brothers savings account to set maturity options on an ISA. Angela was productive, doing another batch of washing and vacuuming. Luckily she brought the washing in before she went out after lunch, since it then rained for the rest of the day!</p>
        <p>The afternoon was a little better. Angela went to table tennis and I re-assembled my tiny Tiger Moth. It was quite fiddly getting the receiver and all the wires back into the body (originally the body was built around the frame with all the electronics already fitted). I now just need to get the battery compartment door to stay closed.</p>
