        <h1>Monday 19th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club I checked the the proof of my FlyPaper article, sending some corrections to Grahame. He soon sent a revision, which I also checked.</p>
        <p>After doing my Dutch lessons (which are becoming tedious) I had a look at some alternatives. Those using YouTube don't really provide interaction.</p>
        <p>Later I attended the IET Sussex events meeting. It was a bit chaotic.</p>
