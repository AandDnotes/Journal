        <h1>Tuesday 20th February</h1>
        <p>Dave P had sent out the attendance list for this evening's talk, so I copied it to my template and printed it off. I also checked that the car park was open to visitors and free after five. Then I probably spent too much time finding web sites that are related to the various research and developments of fusion reactors. I didn't read them, but just listed them for future reference. Since I was going out in the evening we had our main meal at lunchtime.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove to Falmer. I found my way into the Jubilee building, but the lecture theatre took some finding. It is a nice building and a good lecture theatre, if a bit small. The food arrived after most of the people (the talk was well attended) and there wasn't really enough space for it. Anyway, the talk was quite good, but finding a way back to the car park afterwards was more problematic.</p>
