        <h1>Tuesday 13th February</h1>
        <p>I tried to find the IET Eduction kits, but even had difficulty finding the IET Education site. It turned out that there was an error on the Marketing Toolkit, so nothing was showing. It was soon fixed.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Field Place for the RCEA talk on the demise of the UK car manufacturing industry. Surprisingly, John Jermy was their (he knew the speaker), someone from the WSMGOC was there (the speaker's next door neighbour) and Mike W's daughter had married the speaker's son! It was an interesting, although quite depressing talk.</p>
