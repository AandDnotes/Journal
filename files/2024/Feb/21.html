        <h1>Wednesday 21st February</h1>
        <p>A gentler day, at least for me. Angela went to table tennis after lunch as usual, but then also went out in the evening to help make tea/coffee for the audience of a book talk at the Methodist Church. Luckily I din't need to go out, since it rained for most of the day.</p>
        <p>I spent some time taking apart the paper shredder and removing the paper that was wedged behind the micro-switch lever. Unfortunately, it still doesn't move as paper is pushed in. I think there is a small extrusion from the plastic moulding that is blocking it, but that means taking it apart again and trying to remove the cutters.</p>
        <p>I also spent time producing a video of last night's talk from the files on the camera, uploading them to YouTube.</p>
