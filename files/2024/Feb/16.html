        <h1>Friday 16th February</h1>
        <p>For some reason Angela thought that today was Saturday when she got up! However, she wanted to go to the butchers and to the Post Office (to get some cash), so we took the long way, via the Rifle Range. We were back just in time for lunch. Luckily it was a fine day, mainly sunny, warm(ish) and with little breeze.</p>
        <p>The owner of the radio that was taken to the Repair Cafe was collected by its owner. Then I put some silicone around the patio doors in an attempt to stop woodlice coming in.</p>
