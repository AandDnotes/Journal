        <h1>Thursday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>It rained on and off (and sometimes heavily) for most of the day. We started by going to Holmebush, since we could park near the entrance of M&S, shop there and in Tesco and then have coffee in M&S. It helped that Angela had the offer of a free hot drink.</p>
        <p>As often happens, it was nearly lunchtime by the time we got home. After lunch I took the paper shredder apart again, this time removing the motor so that I could get behind the cutters to the slot that the 'auto' lever sits in. I thought I'd cleared it so that the lever would work, but it still didn't work! However, we only bought it last October, so we will take it back to Currys.</p>
        <p>I also ordered some pens, RFID shields and a presenter 'clicker' from the IET Marketing Toolkit. Although I'n not sure that it worked, since I didn't get an email confirmation.</p>
