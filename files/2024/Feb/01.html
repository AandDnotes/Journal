        <h1>Thursday 1st February</h1>
        <p>Well, that is January over, we now just need to get through February before things start warming up a bit. Actually, today was quite a nice day, being sunny and calm all day.</p>
        <p>That was useful since we had a busy and potentially difficult day. I dropped Angela outside Worthing Hospital at about twenty to eleven this morning for her pre-assessment appointment. It was at eleven and was said to be between one and two hours. That was potentially a problem, since we had tickets for a play in Chichester starting at 2:30. I went off to fill the Panda with petrol and after a little tour around found a parking place in a road near the hospital. I was just walking towards the entrance when Angela phoned to say that she was done. In fact she was standing outside and could see me coming.</p>
        <p>So we drove to Chichester and went to the Cathedral cafe for lunch. We sat in a room that had been reserved for a private party (although there was no sign to say so) and it took a while for our sandwiches to arrive. Anyway, we were in good time for the start of the play. It was 'The Circle' by Somerset Maugham, with Jane Asher in the leading role. It was very good. However, getting out of Chichester at 'rush hour' was a pain. Also, the journey home in the dark (with the bright lights of oncoming cars) was difficult. We were home by ten past six.</p>
