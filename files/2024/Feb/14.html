        <h1>Wednesday 14th February</h1>
        <p>It rained for most of the day, so it was a day of a lot of reading. Luckily we had some mail delivered this morning, so I had Main Gear and the Octagon magazine to read. I also had a little email correspondence about the talk next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch. Victoria sent some video clips of Juniper sledging in their front garden.</p>
