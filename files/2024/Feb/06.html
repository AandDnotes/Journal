        <h1>Tuesday 6th February</h1>
        <p>When I woke this morning and turned over in bed, I found that the room was spinning. After a while things stabilised and I was fine for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning researching magnetic actuators and receivers that can drive them, while Angela went to the dentist and did more paper shredding.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Kate phoned about us meeting up in Sudbury in September. We agreed on some dates. Later I drove to Crawley for the IET talk and video'd it. By the time I left it was raining.</p>
