        <h1>Wednesday 7th February</h1>
        <p>Since I am due to be out most of tomorrow, we went off this morning to do our weekly grocery shop. We went to Lidl in Shoreham so that we could then go to Dunelm so as to buy two new pillows. Our old ones are a bit soft/thin and mine is stained.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I once again read the rules for the FIRST Lego League heat tomorrow. Then, after dinner, I went to the Film Night at the Steyning Centre. The place was packed, because the film was 'The Great Escaper', with Micheal Kane and Glenda Jackson. It was very good.</p>
