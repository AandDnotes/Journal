        <h1>Monday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>Following a very windy night it was a little calmer by the time we got up. Angela went to her Monday club while I replied to Irvine, scanned some photos of Angela when six and at her graduation ceremony and then continued working on my tiny TM web page.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to Dunelm and collected our new curtains. We got held up both ways at the level crossing. We then spent the remaining part of the afternoon hanging the curtains in the dining room. We were a little surprised that both pairs of curtains were the same size. They had not cut the width of the material, but just made each curtain from one and a half widths of material. So those for the smaller window had to be pulled up as much as possible.</p>
