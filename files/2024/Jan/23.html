        <h1>Tuesday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>Today, early rain was supposed to change into a dry, but windy day. It rained most of the day. I started by emailing the head of engineering at Chichester University about IET prizes (or any other support) and Angela sewed the new curtain heading cords into the curtain and then went down to the High Street.</p>
        <p>I 'played' with my tiny Tiger Moth web page. I sorted out most of the formatting (style sheet) issues, wrote a description of my build and uploaded it to github. In between I updated the OS on the iMac and read more of the paper.</p>
