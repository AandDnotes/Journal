        <h1>Wednesday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>A wet and windy morning gave way to a dry and breezy afternoon and evening. I did the monthly accounts, which took most of the morning. After lunch Angela went to table tennis, while I tried to pay my SRFC fee, but spent a lot of the time trying to find out how to get a Flier ID. It seems that you need one of those as well as an Operator ID.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'The Astonishing Pilgrimage of Harold Fry'. It was good, if a little slow.</p>
