        <h1>Tuesday 9th January</h1>
        <p>A very cold, but bright start to the day, that carried on that way until sunset. Angela went to the church and the High Street while I added amendments to Robin's notes of our meeting yesterday. Later I did a little more to the tiny TM. I found that one piece of ply was not fitted properly, so I removed it. However, when refitting it, the CA melted the foam on the sides of what will be the fuel tank above the cockpit.</p>
        <p>After lunch Peter picked me up and we went to the RCEA talk on flight simulators. It was an interesting talk. I also had an opportunity to talk with Mike W about the possibility of a fan-boats workshop at Beeding.</p>
