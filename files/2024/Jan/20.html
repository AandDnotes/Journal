        <h1>Saturday 20th January</h1>
        <p>Not quite so sunny this morning, but slightly warmer and breezier. After buying a newspaper I went to the pharmacy to collect three months of tablets. I was somewhat surprised to find them there, having not received any feedback from the email that I sent to the prescription team.</p>
        <p>I then spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts and then opening regular savings accounts for us both, followed by standing orders to fund them.</p>
        <p>After lunch (Gouda cheese on toasted crumpets) we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul. Rowan and Austin/Juniper were playing computer games.</p>
