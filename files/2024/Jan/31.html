        <h1>Wednesday 31st January</h1>
        <p>I emailed Ramon about his editing of the videos of talks and then started looking at the tiny Tiger Moth. Later I found that the motor is not working. Clearly the motor rotated when the propeller broke and 'wound up' the wires. I removed part of the fuselage panels around the motor, but have not yet been able to reach the cable tie that holds all the wires together.</p>
        <p>Angela applied to renew her driving licence, printed off her Lunch Club accounts and, after lunch, went to table tennis. Later, she experimented with a sweet potato, garlic and red onion tortilla. She probably won't make it again!</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Greening meeting at the athletics club. It wasn't what I had been led to believe it would be and it went on until 10pm. However, it was interesting to learn about the different groups that are part of Greening Steyning. I went as a member of the Repair Cafe.</p>
