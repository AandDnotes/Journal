        <h1>Thursday 25th January</h1>
        <p>Overnight rain had stopped, but it was quite misty on the hills for most of the day. We went to Lyons Farm, to B&anp;Q and bought a new lamp shade for the dining room. We later put it in our bedroom and moved the shade from there into the dining room. After B&ampQ we went into Currys to look at possible fridge/freezers for the church kitchen. Kathy had researched models and they had the two she is suggesting in the store. So later, Angela reported back.</p>
        <p>Then we did our weekly shop in Sainsbury's before going to the Jungle Cafe. We were home just in time to get lunch.</p>
        <p>I spent some time working out the timescale of my RC Tx/Rx project so that I can email the editor of BMFA News about an article in last May's edition.</p>
