        <h1>Monday 29th January</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. I collected Peter W at nine o'clock and went to Shoreham station, arriving early since the road works had gone. However, we caught the 9:43 train to Victoria, meeting up with the others when we arrived. The pub in which we normally had coffee was closed, since a bus had run into a bus shelter and the whole area was cordoned off.</p>
        <p>We walked to the London Transport Museum, via Savoy Place. We started with some lunch in their cafe and then went into the museum. It was quite interesting, but I can't see a reason to go there again during the period of the annual ticket. We all met in the cafe again for a cup of tea, before setting off for the usual pub for dinner. The food was worse than usual, so we won't go there again.</p>
        <p>We then caught the 7:16 train home. I got home a little before nine.</p>
