        <h1>Sunday 21st January</h1>
        <p>The fine, but cold weather broke today. There was a little rain over night and during the early morning and then the wind strengthened during the day. We are expecting a storm over night.</p>
        <p>Angela was out for much of the day, at church in the morning and then at a multi-denominational meeting, at the Methodist church, during the afternoon. She was involved in the setting up and then clearing up afterwards and so didn't get home until about 6:30.</p>
        <p>I emailed Victoria with a link to the Karndean web site, received a reply from Irvine Wilson and spent quite some time starting to develop a web page for the building of my tiny Tiger Moth. I wanted it to fit in with the existing radio control pages and yet use a responsive design. I just selected the photos and ;ut them into a page.</p>
