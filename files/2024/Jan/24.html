        <h1>Wednesday 24th January</h1>
        <p>It was bright this morning after overnight rain. However, it soon dried up. I started by drafting the next IET email about our next talks. Then we finally got around to pruning the espalier apple tree, since all the leaves had fallen off.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I walked down to the Steyning Centre with her. I went on through the churchyard, along Tanyard Lane, up to Charlton Street and then home, avoiding mud since I had earlier cleaned the soles of my walking shoes and boots.</p>
        <p>When I got home I corrected errors in my IET email and submitted it for approval.</p>
