        <h1>Friday 19th January</h1>
        <p>Another cold, sunny morning; perhaps the last for a while. So we walked, in freezing, but calm conditions, down to the river and on to the Hub for coffee. Then a more direct route home. That took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>I finally got around to updating my html code for my Journal front end. I tried to get it to work entirely from the local files, but failed. So I just added 2024 to the code.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed Irvine Wilson, having not corresponding with him for three and a half years. Another item on my to-do list.</p>
