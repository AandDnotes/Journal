        <h1>Tuesday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>It was breezy all day and very wet during the morning. Angela washed the floors and I started adding part of the 'foam' bodywork. Actually I only glued on one side and part of the bottom. In the process I discovered that I had fitted two magnets in the frame, whereas one should go into the 'flap'. I also found that the foam glue is a contact adhesive, which makes positioning almost impossible. But attaching pieces while the glue is still wet seems to work quite well.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked down to the Health Centre for our pneumonia and shingles jabs. Luckily it had stopped raining, even though we had dressed for the rain. We are expecting to have sore arms.</p>
        <p>Later I phoned Alan.</p>
