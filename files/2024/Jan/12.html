        <h1>Friday 12th January</h1>
        <p>A grey day of ups and downs. Angela started by going to the butchers while I wrote notes of yesterday evening's meeting and dealt with a couple of other email. The 'down' was my attempt to contact the Worthing Hospital neurology department to see if my referral actually got there. After several attempts to get to the correct person, I had to leave a message in the hope that they will call me back.</p>
        <p>Another 'down' was my attempt to test the receiver/servos on my tiny TM. I could not get the transmitter and receiver to bind, although they did once, even though the transmitter kept beeping.</p>
        <p>I put a fan heater blowing under the TC for an hour and, just as it was starting to get dark, I managed to start the TC (after a lot of engine turning) and drove it to Washington and back. It was the first time I'd taken the TC out since November. I also put my tools together for tomorrow's Repair Cafe.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela worked hard, making nine jars of marmalade.</p>
