        <h1>Thursday 4th January</h1>
        <p>It was dry and calm this morning, but then the rain started and became heavier as the day went on. So our morning shop was not affected too much. Angela wanted to buy a mattress 'topper' for our bed and had to buy the ingredients for the lunch club on Monday. So we started at Dunelm (including having coffee), went on to Lidl to buy most of our groceries and some of the lunch club groceries and then went to Tesco to buy a few of our things and more for the lunch club. However, we were still short of a few things, so went on to Sainsbury's, getting home at around two o'clock for a late lunch after taking the lunch club food to the church, mainly to put in their freezer.</p>
        <p>By this time the rain had set in. However, Angela went out later to put a card into Phylis and Gordon's door (he is in hospital). She got very wet.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I glued a few more pieces of 'foam' fuselage skin on to my tiny Tiger Moth.</p>
