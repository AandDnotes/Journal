        <h1>Sunday 7th January</h1>
        <p>Another dry, but not very productive day. Angela went to church and I did a few jobs, together with a little more work on the tiny Tiger Moth.</p>
        <p>Work on the model continued later in the afternoon. I finished fitting all the fuselage 'panels' and put on the 'stickers' to add colour and design to the top, front and part of the bottom. I also put the wheels together.</p>
        <p>While we were having dinner Paul called. They had been to Goude to go ice skating (posting some photos) and had been to the pancake house for dinner.</p>
