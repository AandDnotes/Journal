        <h1>Thursday 18th January</h1>
        <p>After the cloud of yesterday, we made the most of the sunny, calm, but cold weather and went for another walk after lunch. Before that we went to Worthing to do the weekly shop. We started in Lidl and then went on to Waitrose.</p>
        <p>I did a final set of tests on the motor in the Repair Cafe hand mixer. 12 volts from my power supply was not enough to turn it, but every segment had a resistance. I did clean the commutator, but there was no power (just a very low voltage) from the PCB to the motor. So I reassembled it and phoned the owner. He will collect it at the next Repair Cafe.</p>
