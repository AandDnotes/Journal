        <h1>Sunday 28th January</h1>
        <p>After checking the Skipton Building Society bond that had matured and been moved to a new one, and while Angela was at church, I removed the broken propeller from the tinyTM and found that the motor fixing tie-wrap had also broken. I searched for a replacement prop, but if someone had a 3" prop none of them had a small enough hole for the motor shaft. Then I found that the Minimum RC site had spare props for sale. So I ordered two, even though the shipping cost was twice the cost of the props.</p>
        <p>Then I uploaded the video of the maiden flight on to the iMac and into iMovie, before editing it and adding a title. I also captured a couple of stills, although they are not very clear. Later I uploaded the video (all 35 seconds of it) to our Google Photos site.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk, down past the mill pond, before talking with Paul and Rowan.</p>
