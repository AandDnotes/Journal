        <h1>Monday 8th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to set up for the lunch club, while I dealt with a couple of email and worked on my tiny Tiger Moth. That was until just before midday when I collected Barbara from just around the corner and took her to the lunch club. It started sleeting just as I went out of the front door!</p>
        <p>I stood in for Phylis (Gordon is still in hospital) and collected the money. Since the people who normally 'say grace' were not there, I asked everyone to join me in saying thanks for the food and the helpers. Stephen, the minister, arrived a little later. I had been asked to take John home, but he was ill and so didn't come. So after helping to put the tables and chairs away I brought Barbara home and did a little more to the tTM. It was now snowing and settling on top of cars.</p>
        <p>Luckily it had stoped snowing by the time that I had to go to Beeding Primary School, with some other Repair Cafe volunteers, to talk about things we might be able to do with the children. Since ice was forecast I decided not to go to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. So we started the Goude cheese and watched the TV.</p>
