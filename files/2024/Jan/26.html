        <h1>Friday 26th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to walk to the Hub in Beeding for a meeting. She then walked back. I emailed the editor of BMFA News about the article on a DIY transmitter and receiver. I also updated my spreadsheet with the January gas/electricity data.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny, calm day, so after lunch we went for a walk around the upper horseshoe; quite a climb to get to the top.</p>
