        <h1>Wednesday 10th January</h1>
        <p>It was a cold, but sunny morning, so we started by going for a walk, stoping on the way at Victoria's Sponge for a coffee. Ann came in and we spent more time there than we had expected, so we only got home just before it was time to make lunch.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday Angela went to table tennis while I replied to Daniel about the March speaker, renewed my SRFC membership and replied about IET Education Volunteers. I managed to get a very small amount of work on my tiny TM before Angela got home. Later I fitted the tailplane and prepared the lower wings for fitting.</p>
        <p>Later still, we booked tickets to see a Somerset Maugham comedy, The Circle at the beginning of February.</p>
