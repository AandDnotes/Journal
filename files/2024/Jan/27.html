        <h1>Saturday 27th January</h1>
        <p>Another fine day, if a little more cloudy early on. We walked to the High Street to get a paper and some cash. I then charged the batteries that I would need in the evening and managed to get the rotary washing line 'plug' out of the ground. Angela did two batches of washing, since it was sunny, with just a light breeze.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Then, after dinner, I went to Worthing High School for the Flying Club's indoor flying session. They ran three sessions, helicopter/multi-rotor, fixed wing and light-weight. Clive checked my tiny TM. Both the ailerons and rudder needed reversing and he tried to increase the upward deflection of the elevator. The Tom gave it a trial flight. It goes quite fast, even on only a quarter power.</p>
        <p>When I tried I got it in the air, but the wall got in the way (twice), cracking the engine cowl and one side of the undercarriage. I glued the undercarriage, but in the next session I hit the ground, breaking the propeller! So I came home.</p>
