        <h1>Sunday 14th January</h1>
        <p>Another cold, calm and mainly grey day, although the forecast is for it to get even colder. Angela went to church as I unpacked my tool bag after yesterday's Repair Cafe and then checked the tyre pressures on both cars. All were low, probably due to the cold temperature.</p>
        <p>I then charged the small battery for the tiny TM, or at least I think I have. It didn't take very long, although it only has a small capacity. My battery tester doesn't support 1S batteries and I can't find out how to get the charger to show the capacity. Then I started making the push rods for the rudder and elevator.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke to Victoria. She had received a good report from Austin's teachers. Then we spoke with Paul. Next week, Rowan is due to visit the secondary school that she is likely to attend in September and also go on an ice skating school outing.</p>
