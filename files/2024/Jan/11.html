        <h1>Thursday 11th January</h1>
        <p>Another bright, cold day, although it clouded over during the afternoon. After doing the weekly shop at Lyons Farm we went to Squires to buy some Seville oranges and to have coffee. So, again it was lunchtime before we got home.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I managed to complete gluing the parts of the tiny TM together. I now need to connect the servos to the control surfaces.</p>
        <p>After dinner I ran the PEI Group meeting. Everyone just described the events they had organised or planned. Although there was an exchange of information about potential speakers.</p>
