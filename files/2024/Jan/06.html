        <h1>Saturday 6th January</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day, but a dry one. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. Then I did the weekly accounts and looked again at regular savings accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Having a headache, I then had a bit of a nap in my chair.</p>
