        <h1>Saturday 13th January</h1>
        <p>Our only reason to walk to the High Street on a cold, grey, windless morning was to buy a newspaper. We did look in the Post Office for jam covers, but they didn't have the ones Angela wanted.</p>
        <p>When we got back I checked the TC's oil and water and then  brushed the edges of the garage door and lubricated the wheels. The door had been failing to close. It didn't seem to help, so I lubricated the hinges and after lunch, when we went out, the door worked. Then I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling them against the statement. I also looked at the LiPo battery charger, trying to save some settings, but I failed.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe, taking Angela so that she could walk back. The Cafe was very busy and I brought home a hand-held mixer that I couldn't get apart.</p>
