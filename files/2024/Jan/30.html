        <h1>Tuesday 30th January</h1>
        <p>I did a little preparation for this evening's IET Sussex committee meeting, mainly around social media statistics, while Angela went down to the butchers. Then I moved the strip light in the study from over the computer desk to over the other desk.</p>
        <p>It was a grey, but calm and dry day, so after lunch we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe. We were just back in time for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended the committee meeting.</p>
