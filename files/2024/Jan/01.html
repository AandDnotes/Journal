        <h1>Monday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day!</p>
        <p>Not an early morning, but later we went went for a walk around the Lower Horseshoe. We were just back in time for Angela to finish making some soup for lunch.</p>
        <p>I connected the servos and motor to the receiver and checked that they worked. Then attached the receiver to the frame using two small pieces of velcro. I had to remove the insulation tape I'd put around the motor cable connector and shorten the shrink wrap to get it to fit. Finally I fitted the magnet that holds the battery door closed. The next step is adding the fuselage parts.</p>
        <p>We had a quiet evening, both still feeling tired.</p>
