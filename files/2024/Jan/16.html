        <h1>Tuesday 16th January</h1>
        <p>I started by preparing a speaker's certificate and attendance list for the evening's talk. Then I continued connecting the servos to the control surfaces, finishing it by the end of the day. However, I did need to put some glue on one aileron that was splitting along the join with the wing. I now need to test it with the transmitter.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for another walk; a shorter one this time. The weather started cold, calm and with a blue sky and continued that way, so the walk was good.</p>
        <p>Later I went to Falmer for a talk on quantum computing. It was cold, but not freezing and the talk was very good. Luckily there was also enough food.</p>
