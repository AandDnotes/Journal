        <h1>Friday 5th January</h1>
        <p>It wasn't raining when we got up! After breakfast I booked an appointment at the barbers in the High Street for later in the morning.</p>
        <p>Angela started preparing to cook various things and I walked down for my haircut, done by a lady from Austria. She cut it shorter than I wanted, but Angela liked it.</p>
        <p>Immediately after lunch we went to Dunelm (again) and ordered some curtains for the dining room. The traffic was heavy and we got caught twice at the level crossing.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I had started responding to the CAA consultation, as urged by both the BMFA and the SRFC. I'd not realised that there were 35 questions, so it took a long time, even when copying and pasting the comments from the SRFC suggested responses. I saved my entry part way through and finished it later. I also glued the final pieces of foam along the top of the tiny Tiger Moth fuselage and added the rear skid.</p>
