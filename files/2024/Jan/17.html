        <h1>Wednesday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Another cold, dry, but grey day. Luckily we didn't get any snow, which was a possibility. It was also a reasonably successful day.</p>
        <p>I started by testing the tiny TM with the transmitter. All seemed to be well, so I discharged the battery to storage level and hung up the plane. Then I searched for details of how to dismantle the hand mixer and found a useful video on YouTube. So, after checking the fuse in the plug, I started taking apart the mixer from the Repair Cafe. It was very difficult, but during the afternoon I got it all apart. On the way I checked the mains cord and the EMI filter. However, the PCB was coated, so I couldn't even check the thermal fuse. The ribbon cable joining the controls to the main board was loose, but that may have happened during dismantling.</p>
        <p>Angela sorted through more 'family' photos, shredded old documents and went to table tennis during the afternoon.</p>
