        <h1>Monday 15th January</h1>
        <p>Having received an email from Greame A yesterday about the planned trip to the London Transport Museum, I spent part of the morning buying my entry ticket, my rail tickets and my parking ticket. It will be an expensive day out. Meanwhile, Angela went to her Monday ladies club. I also managed to get the transmitter/receiver to bind on the tiny TM (the transmitter's batteries were low) and started connecting the control horns to the servos.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk down to the river. We were out for an hour and three quarters. I was quite tired. However, I generated a 'start slide' for tomorrow's talk and sent it to Deshinder, who is the convenor.</p>
