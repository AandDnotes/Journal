        <h1>Sunday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>We had a slow start, but then it was a full-on day. We left home at about eleven and drove to Alan's. It took three hours! The M25 was horrendous in places, but we arrived on time. In fact we were the first there. However, it was then a good day, with about 25 people, even if it was mainly overcast. The only problem was that they did not start cooking until about three o'clock.</p>
        <p>We left just after 6:30 and were home at ten to nine, so only a two hour twenty minute journey, although we did not stop.</p>
        <p>When we got home we had a short chat with Victoria, who is now in Missouri.</p>
