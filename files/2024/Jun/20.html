        <h1>Thursday 20th June</h1>
        <p>The summer solstice and being Thursday it was grocery shopping day. We set off to Lyons Farm until we saw the the traffic jam on the A27. So we went into Worthing to Lidl and then went back to Sainsbury's to get a few remaining things and fill the Panda with petrol. However, when we got to Findon Vale garden centre I realised that I had lost my (new) reading glasses. So, after coffee, we went back to Boots at Lyons Farm to get a new pair. I also bought a lanyard!</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I continued tidying up the garage. It is now in a state to hang up sheets to cover the things that are around the walls.</p>
