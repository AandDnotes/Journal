        <h1>Friday 7th June</h1>
        <p>This morning I took the TC on the 'figure of eight' route to get some petrol. Later I checked the oil and water levels. Angela went to the hygienist.</p>
        <p>We both had email from Virgin Money about a bond that is about to mature, so I set the maturity options to open another a one year bond.</p>
        <p>On my magnetic actuator, I soldered a connection and fitted the coil to my mock-up of a rudder. The movement was 'minimal'. I need to check the software and perhaps make a coil with twice the length of wire.</p>
        <p>In the early evening we walked down to the Methodist Church for a quiz night and fish snd chip supper. Our team (of five) came fourth out of six. It was quite a good quiz.</p>
