        <h1>Wednesday 26th June</h1>
        <p>An even hotter day. Angela went off walking with her friends in the morning, going around the lower horseshoe (again) because it is shaded by trees. I put my overalls on over my pants and continued working in the garage. I:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gave both sides of the three patches another coat of Hammerite.</li>
          <li>Put a coat of Hammerite on the base of the side screens box.</li>
          <li>Checked the oil level in the rear dampers, topping up the off-side damper.</li>
          <li>Topped up the oil in the differential.</li>
          <li>Removed the rear off-side brake drum and cleaned it out. There seems to be a very slight weep from the slave cylinder and there was quite a lot of dust.</li>
          <li>Removed the spare wheel, gave it a clean and put a spot of white Hammerite over a spot on the 'knock-off' where the chrome had flaked off.</li>
          <li>Cleaned under the rear wheel arches.</li>
          <li>Cleaned the chassis from the rear to the front of the springs.</li>
        </ul>
