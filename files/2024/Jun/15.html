        <h1>Saturday 15th June</h1>
        <p>A day of two halves; a wet half and a dry, sunny half. We dressed up in our waterproof trousers and cagoules to walk down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Then we had coffee, read some of the paper and watched the 'trooping of the colour' before I went upstairs to do the weekly accounts. We had spent quite a lot in M&S! I also printed the details of SU carburettor tuning, according to an ex racer. It sounds plausible, but we will see if it works.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. The children have now finished school for the summer, so they are going to Missouri on Wednesday. Brandon normally goes into work on a Wednesday, so will take them to the airport (even though it transpires that this Wednesday is a national holiday).</p>
        <p>As usual, Angela did some work in the garden and did some washing and cleaning. I took the pots and pistons off the TC's carburettors and adjusted the jet on one of them. I have to measure the distance of the top of the jet from the shoulder, using my vernier calliper. I'll adjust the jet on the other carburettor and try adjusting the fuel level tomorrow.</p>
