        <h1>Sunday 16th June</h1>
        <p>A wet start changed fairly early into a mainly sunny, but windy day. While Angela was at church I checked our credit card statement and updated my accounts spreadsheet before going into the garage.</p>
        <p>Although I planned to continue tuning the TC's carburettors, I got distracted by the threshold step into the garage. For some time I knew that the wood was rotting, but I kept putting off doing anything about it. For some reason I decided to tackle it today. I can't make a 'permanent' repair, but I scraped out the soft wood and coated it with wood preservative. When that I dry (hopefully tomorrow) I will fill the grooves with filler and, when that is dry, paint it with wood stain.</p>
        <p>Then I got back to the TC. I adjusted the jet level in the front carburettor, discovering that the jet's position is easily disturbed and so needs to be pulled up while making a measurement. Consequently I had to reset the jet in the rear carburettor. Later I started trying to set the fuel level in the front carburettor. This is done by bending the forked lever that allows the float to close the fuel inlet. Every adjustment requires removing the top of the float chamber and then the fork (without dropping the pin and the needle), then bending the fork before putting it all back again. By the end of the day I 'might' have set the fuel level for the front carburettor.</p>
        <p>In the middle of this we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
