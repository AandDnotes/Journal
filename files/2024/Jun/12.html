        <h1>Wednesday 12th June</h1>
        <p>This morning we both left home at about the same time. Angela went to the bus stop to meet her walking friends and I drove to the Sussex Oak in Warham to meet the members of the Sussex Wanderers.</p>
        <p>After coffee and chat we set off in the TC. David F-B had arrived in his modern TF. Part way along the route we came across a diversion! The route had been checked last night, but it looked as though there was a broken water main. However, the diversion was quite a good route through narrow lanes up to Lieth Hill. In fact the whole route was good.</p>
        <p>We could smell petrol on the route and when we got back to the Sussex Oak, petrol was being spilt on the road. Also, the low fuel light was on. The hold-up bolt on the rear carburettor was loose, so I tightened it. When we left, David followed me to a garage at Broadbridge Heath, where I bought some petrol. The spilt fuel has destroyed the paint on the steering column and I found that both hold-up bolts seem to be leaking.</p>
        <p>Luckily it was a dry day and I drove a total of 69 miles.</p>
