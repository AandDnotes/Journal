        <h1>Friday 28th June</h1>
        <p>After sending a few email, including one to the prescriptions team about my repeat prescription, we set off for Wakehurst Place. We had a good morning's walk around the site, leaving just before our two and a half hour parking expired. However, we took a wrong turn on the way there, going down a long, narrow and twisty lane to get to Ardingly, and then another wrong turn on the way back, going along the A272 in the wrong direction for a while!</p>
        <p>After a very late lunch I downloaded Graeme Awcock's video file and tried to get it working on Quicktime. However, Handbrake is reducing the resolution. So I went in the garage, put some black Hammerite around the patches on the side-screen box, cleaned the rear wheels and put them back on. Angela worked in the garden.</p>
