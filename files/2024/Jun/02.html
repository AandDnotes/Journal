        <h1>Sunday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>Whilst I was still in the bathroom, my fuel additive arrived, delivered by a post lady!</p>
        <p>Shortly after Angela left for church I started the TC and drove to Buckingham Park in Shoreham. A car boot sale at the flyover caused quite a queue, in all directions. Quite a lot of cars were already there when I arrived. It was fine and sunny all day and lots of visitors. There was also a full fair, donkey rides, a dog show, singers/dancers and many stalls.</p>
        <p>I had taken my lunch and a chair. There was quite a lot of interest in the TC and a few people took my details. By 3:30 quite a few cars had gone, so I packed up and was home just after four.</p>
        <p>When I got home we spoke to Paul and Rowen.</p>
