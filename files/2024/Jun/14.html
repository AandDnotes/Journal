        <h1>Friday 14th June</h1>
        <p>It was mainly dry today, with only one short spell of rain. And it was an interesting day.</p>
        <p>After emailing someone who wants to join my PEI group, I went into the garage. I started by cleaning the spark plugs and then removed the contact points, cleaned them and refitted/adjusted them. Then I took the car for a short run to warm the engine and then adjusted the timing. I did this by listening to the engine, retarding it a little from the current setting. A second test run indicated that the engine was running well. I had a slight problem with the speedo gearbox on the dynamo coming loose and fouling the distributor.</p>
        <p>In the middle of this I joined a Teams meeting with a couple of students who are interested in setting up an IET group at the University of Brighton.</p>
        <p>Earlier I had downloaded what was described as 'a horrible scan of the production records transcribed by Dick Knudson while he was at the factory in the 60s.' from the mg-tabc forum. When I looked for the record for TC4985 I found that it was listed with the current engine number, not what I had thought was the original engine. The T Register database shows a different engine number. I put a message on the forum to ask if the engine was changed before it left the factory.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening I phone Venkatesh, who has moved to the UK and is living in Milton Keynes. He is with the same company (Cognisant), but seems to be responsible for Europe and Australia!</p>
