        <h1>Saturday 8th June</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual walk to the High Street. In addition to a newspaper, Angela bought the remaining items for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>While Angela was working in the garden, I spent some time reconciling my accounts against the bank statement. After lunch it was Repair Cafe time. It was quite a quiet session. Four of us on the electrical bench managed easily.</p>
        <p>After dinner we spoke with Victoria.</p>
