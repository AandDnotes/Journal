        <h1>Tuesday 18th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the butchers, I went to the dentist for a checkup. She poked around a bit and the took x-rays of each side. She said that my oral hygiene was good and all my fillings were fine.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's IET events meeting I took a couple of actions, so I did an audit of the IET branded items that I have and emailed the committee with that list and the items available on the Marketing Toolkit. I then emailed Daniel Eastwood about  a possible topic for a joint IET/ADSC event.</p>
        <p>Upper Beeding Primary School have said that they would like a Control Technologies workshop on 9th July. So I emailed Keith and Greg to see if they are available.</p>
        <p>I then sanded down the filler on the garage door step and gave the step a coat of wood stain. After lunch I applied another coat and then a third just before dinner. In between I started doing a little tidying in the garage, with a view to getting it ready for the roof to be replaced.</p>
