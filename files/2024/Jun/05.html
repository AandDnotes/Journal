        <h1>Wednesday 5th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went off walking around Thakeham with her walking group, I drove to Falmer, to the Amex Stadium for an RCEA organised tour. The road works by Beeding roundabout held me up for then minutes, But I got there just in time (one person was later than me).</p>
        <p>The tour was quite interesting, although probably more so to those interested in football. They were raking the pitch and lifting the surface so as to re-seed it for next season. The various hospitality rooms are very smart and clearly designed to get as much cash from the spectators as possible. Whilst on the terraces we saw a pair of peregrine falcons that are nesting in the 'eves' of the stadium.</p>
        <p>I was held up by the road works on the way home, although it cleared as I reached Dacre Gardens since the temporary traffic lights were cleared away. I arrived home at about twenty past one.</p>
        <p>Angela worked in the garden and I caught up with email and uploaded most of the photos on my phone to my OneDrive account.</p>
