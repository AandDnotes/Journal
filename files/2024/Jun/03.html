        <h1>Monday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>This morning was pretty much normal for a Monday. Angela went to her Monday club and I finished the monthly accounts and finished winding my magnetic actuator coil. I had to unwind it quite a bit and one side of the cardboard spool has come unglued, so I have some fixing to do. Unusually, I also did my Dutch, since we would be out after lunch.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we set off to Sayers Common to SpaMedica. Today was my appointment for my second cataract surgery. I went in almost immediately and we were out in just over two hours. The surgeon was quite brusk and rough. He seemed as though he was in a hurry. The rest of the staff were very good.</p>
        <p>When we got home Angela cut the lawns. My left eye ached and watered much more than the right eye did.</p>
