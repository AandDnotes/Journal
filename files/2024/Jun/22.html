        <h1>Saturday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>The day started a little wet, but brightened up during the day. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some flowers to take tomorrow. I then did the weekly accounts and collected together the photos of my recent outings with the TC to the Steyning Vintage Revival, to the Lions family day at Shoreham and to the Burgess Hill classic car show.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela was picked up to go to Goring Road to help prepare for the St Barnabas garden party. I followed on foot after I had done my Dutch lessons. By this time it was warm and, while there, the sun came out. I won a raffle prize, but by the time my number was drawn it was a choice between a scented candle and a luggage weigher. I chose the latter. Angela stayed a while longer to help clear up.</p>
        <p>I finished adding the TC's outings to my web site.</p>
