        <h1>Friday 21st June</h1>
        <p>A warm and mainly sunny day. After a batch of washing was hung out and I'd emailed Greg and the teacher at Beeding school, we drove to Nymans Gardens at Handcross. We had a gentle walk around the gardens, looked in the house, including at the paintings exhibition and had some lunch, sitting outside. We were home at about three o'clock.</p>
        <p>I caught up with email and messaged Neil Hatfield to see if he had a timing light for sale. I was also able to extract a photo of my TC, sitting alongside two other TCs at the last Wanderers outing.</p>
