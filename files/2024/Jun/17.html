        <h1>Monday 17th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club, I checked the fuel level in the front carburettor on the TC and then spent the rest of the morning setting the level on the rear carburettor. It was necessary to measure things multiple times, particularly when you had to lower the jet until the petrol meniscus was at the top of the jet. This was very variable. However, I managed to get them both with a set of measurements falling within the required range.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny and fairly warm day, so after lunch Angela cut the grass and I reassembled the carburettors. Then I tried to start the car. It started easily and I could push in the choke almost straight away. I took the car for my usual figure of eight test route and it ran very well. I will need to check the plugs after a longer run.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended an IET meeting (via Teams) of the events committee.</p>
