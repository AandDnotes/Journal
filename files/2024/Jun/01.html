        <h1>Saturday 1st June</h1>
        <p>My 76th birthday. And it stayed dry, with sunny intervals, if a bit breezy and cool. We took our usual Saturday morning walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and it was also market day.</p>
        <p>Since we were going to a talk in the early evening we had our main meal at lunchtime. We then had a chat with Victoria.</p>
        <p>I also managed to do a little more winding of the coil, although I had to unwind a lot of it to correct a point where the wire went outside the spool.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the Methodist Church to help prepare for providing refreshments at the talk. I followed a little later with my ticket. The talk, part of the Steyning Festival, was about the Steyning Railway, the track of which now forms the Downs Link path and the Steyning bypass. The talk, most of which was a video (part one of six and a snippet of part two) was very good. The main presenter in the film and the person who ran the evening, was Stephen Cranford, from BBC Sussex.</p>
