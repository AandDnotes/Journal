        <h1>Wednesday 19th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went for a walk around the lower horseshoe with her walking friends, I checked where I was going after lunch and downloaded the parking app used at the University of Sussex. Then I checked the cars over. I also cleaned a little more of the garage.</p>
        <p>After a slightly early lunch I drove to Falmer to meet Dan and two UoB students. I parked in the multi-story car park and used the app. We went to a cafe on the UoS campus to talk about running a student group. When I got back to the car there was a note on the windscreen from someone who had 'scraped' the bumper. It took longer to get home, since the A27 off-slip at Shoreham is closed. So I had to go to Lyons Farm and do a U-turn.</p>
        <p>When I got home I cleaned the mark on the bumper with some T-cut and touched up the two paint scratches, then sent a text to the culprit. I also sent details of the 'Great Electric Egg Race' to the students as an example of a STEM event that had been run in the past.</p>
