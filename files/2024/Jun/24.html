        <h1>Monday 24th June</h1>
        <p>Quite a warm day. Angela went to her Monday club and then worked in the garden. I took the TC for a run up to Partridge Green and back down through Henfield. It started easily and I could push the choke in straight away. Then it ran very well. I've either got the carburettors tuned properly or else it is running way too rich. I will check the plugs later. I then spent some time getting the TC up on axle stands so as to cover the holes in the side screen box and check things prior to its MoT (and check the plugs).</p>
        <p>I updated djsmgs/TC4985 with the recent outings additions.</p>
