        <h1>Thursday 13th June</h1>
        <p>Although it was our usual grocery shopping day, Angela wanted to look for some trousers and a top. So we went to Holmbush to look around Next (nothing found) and then M&amp;S. Angela found trousers and top and I found a green, wide-brimmed hat and a pair of x2.0 reading glasses. We also did all our grocery shopping in M&amp;S (as well as having coffee).</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage to look at the TC. I found that the hold-up bolt on both carburettors were loose. I tightened them and then cleaned the dissolved paint off the steering column before painting it with black Hammerite. I also tried rubbing the air filters and carburettor pots with T-cut. It didn't make a lot of difference. Angela, meanwhile, did more work in the garden.</p>
        <p>An email from Horsham prompted me to buy a parking disk for the coming year.</p>
