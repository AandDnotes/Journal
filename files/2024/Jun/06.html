        <h1>Thursday 6th June</h1>
        <p>The 50th anniversary of D-Day.</p>
        <p>We expected it to be a normal supermarket shopping day, but it turned out to be a little busier. Angela drove us to Argos at Lyons Farm (in Sainsbury's) to buy a carmon monoxide alarm and then to Morrisons since she needed to buy things for the Lunch Club on Monday. We also did our weekly shop there. Then off to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee.</p>
        <p>We had a call from British Gas to say that they'd had a cancellation and a technician was in the area, so could they do our boiler service. Five minutes later he was here. He had to replace a gasket that was leaking.</p>
        <p>I made an appointment at the optician for my left-eye cataract surgery to be checked in a month's time. I also chased the estimate from a second roofing company. That came in a little later, but was over a thousand pounds more than the local company. So I phoned them to ask them to replace the garage roof. They will call back to propose a date for the work.</p>
