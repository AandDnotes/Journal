        <h1>Thursday 27th June</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. From there we went to Findon Vale garden centre.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela worked in the garden, including cutting all the grass, and I epoxy'd the three patches on to the bottom of the side-screen box. I had to put more epoxy into other holes and around the patches. The epoxy is quite old and went from liquid to semi-solid quite suddenly, so I had to mix up multiple batches.</p>
