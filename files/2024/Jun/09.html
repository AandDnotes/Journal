        <h1>Sunday 9th June</h1>
        <p>At about 9:15 I started the TC and set off for Burgess Hill, where there was a classic car show. Getting to near the show-ground was fine, but a road closure caused a lot of people to get lost. Luckily they had a marshal out on the street to direct people. There were a lot of cars, of all types and, although it clouded over after lunch, it stayed dry. I didn't get any interest in the TC and the whole event was a bit boring, although I was able to read some of my book. I got home just after four, the round trip being 36 miles.</p>
        <p>Angela, of course, went to church in the morning and worked in the garden later. Just after I got home we spoke to Paul.</p>
