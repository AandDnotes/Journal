        <h1>Tuesday 11th June</h1>
        <p>A quieter day. Angela took the bus to Storrington to bank her lunch club cash and did a number of small things, including filling in my dentist forms. Then I sprayed some of the weeds on the drive with white vinegar (with a squirt of washing up liquid).</p>
        <p>Angela bought another handbag from a charity shop and so I salvaged the leather, using a piece to line the slot in the iPad stand.</p>
        <p>Otherwise there was quite a bit of reading.</p>
