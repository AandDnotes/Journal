        <h1>Tuesday 25th June</h1>
        <p>A really hot day. I spent a lot of it in the garage. I made three patches for the side screens box out of some scrap aluminium sheet and gave both sides a coat of black Hammerite. I also removed the off-side rear brake drum and brushed it, although there wasn't much dust to remove.</p>
        <p>Apart from a walk to the High Street, Angela worked in the garden. After dinner I attended an IET Sussex committee meeting via Teams.</p>
