        <h1>Monday 10th June</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. Angela was cutting up chicken when I got up. She went off early to the church to start cooking for the lunch club. I went down just after twelve. Prior to that, since the TC was pulling to the left when I braked, I removed the front wheels and brake drums, brushed them out and adjusted the shoes. Later in the evening, when I took the car out, the brakes seemed okay.</p>
        <p>There were quite a few helpers at the lunch club and about 30 people eating. So we were home by 3:30. However, the door to the toilet in the front entrance of the church was stuck closed, the handle would not open the lock. So we went back down later, with some tools and fixed the lock.</p>
        <p>Later still, I took the TC to Washington to the WSMGOC meeting. There were quite a few MGs there and my TC came second in a vote of people's favourite car (Ken's Magnette came first). Then I won first prize in the raffle! Rather than picking a box of grommets, I chose the bottle of wine.</p>
