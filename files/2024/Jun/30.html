        <h1>Sunday 30th June</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church and I went into the garage to continue working on the TC. I removed the plugs and found that they were not as sooty as I'd feared. In fact they seemed slightly less sooty. My conclusion is that the jets and needles have worn over the years and so I can't do much else apart from replacing them. So I carried on cleaning the underside of the car.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela took a cake she had made to the church, where they were serving teas (and cake) to people who were visiting the Open Garden Scheme gardens. She visited a few gardens on her way home.</p>
        <p>I put the dinner in the oven and, during half-time in the England-Slovacia match, we spoke with Paul. They were watching the game.</p>
