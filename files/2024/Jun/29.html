        <h1>Saturday 29th June</h1>
        <p>After our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things, I did the weekly accounts and Angela worked in the garden. Then I uploaded Graeme Awcock's revised video to YouTube. All seems well.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, with a small chat with Brandon and Austin. Then I went in the garage and re-assembled the tonneau area, replacing the floor and side-screen flap and then putting everything back in the area. Then I removed the front wheels and checked for any play in the drag link off-side ball joint, as mentioned on the last MoT certificate. I couldn't see any movement.</p>
        <p>Programmes on the TV were either Glastonbury or football (Euro 2024), so we read and I produced some small CoCo procedures to use in the planned workshop until the first news programme.</p>
