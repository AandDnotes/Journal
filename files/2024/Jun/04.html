        <h1>Tuesday 4th June</h1>
        <p>My eye was feeling more comfortable this morning. I took off the shield and wiped my eyelids in boiled water, then applied a 'drop'. My vision seemed really good.</p>
        <p>I didn't think that I had much to do today. However, it turned out to be a busy day. We were up a little earlier than usual and took the Panda down to Simms to have a new timing belt fitted. Angela drove, due to my surgery and we walked home, doing a little shopping on the way (although we forgot to buy lettuce).</p>
        <p>A renewal notice for our house insurance (from Saga) arrived this morning. It had gone up 82%!! Admittedly it had been fixed for three years and would be fixed for another three. I got a quotation from Direct Line, which was just over half the cost of the Saga policy. So I bought it. Meanwhile, Angela worked in the front garden, including pruning the hibiscus by the front door.</p>
        <p>We had a call from the garage to say that the car was ready, so after lunch we walked down to collect it. Replacing the timing belt and water pump cost very nearly Â£500. We then caught up with our Dutch lessons, doing more than usual. We also received an invitation to Chris and Alan's 50th wedding anniversary barbecue.</p>
