        <h1>Friday 9th August</h1>
        <p>An interesting, but tiring day. We set off with Victoria and Brandon at ten o'clock to go to Enkhuizen. When Brandon worked for Syngenta he would sometimes go there and his colleague (and later boss) lives and works there. Enkhuizen is as far north of Amsterdam as Berkenwoude is south, so it took one hour forty minutes to get there. It is on the Zeiderzee.</p>
        <p>Brandon had arranged to meet his friend, Renata, nearby an open-air museum.Luckily it had (almost) stopped raining when we got there. She came around the museum with us. We had some lunch in their cafe and later, when we went to the indoor part of the museum, Renata left us.</p>
        <p>The museum was a collection of buildings, brought from various parts of the region, and put together in the form a village. The main activity was fishing, so there was a lot about smoking herring. At one time the area was the trade centre of northern Europe for herring.</p>
        <p>The indoor part had a collection of boats, costumes and furnishings, plus tales of local life and the reclamation the Zeiderzee.</p>
        <p>Afterwards we went to a brewery so that Barndon could buy some beer, then walked around Enkhuizen before stopping for dinner. We got back at about 8:40. In the mean time, the rest had gone to the beach after dinner.</p>
