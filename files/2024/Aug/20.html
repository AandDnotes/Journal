        <h1>Tuesday 20th August</h1>
        <p>Today was leaving day, so we packed our cases fairly early. However, the morning was slow. The children didn't seem to want to do anything. Eventually it was lunchtime, which was a little early since Austin had an appointment at the hospital to have his arm seen to.</p>
        <p>While Krista, Brandon, Victoria and Austin went off, Rowan and Juniper skated up and down the drive and then I went with them along the road as far as the next house. The girl that lives there was dressed as a cat! The girls then bounced on the trampoline and I spoke to the mother, a Ukrainian, who had been in the Netherlands for just over two years.</p>
        <p>As we were driving down the road, going to Goude station, so we passed the others coming back. Austin had his blue cast replaced with an orange one. We caught the train into Rotterdam Centraal an then the train to Schiphol airport. After soup and filled rolls at a cafe in the station we checked our cases and went through security. It is much easier than at Gatwick (we didn't have to take anything out of our bag) and it was a rare for Angela to get through without being stopped. After coffee and apple cake we went to the gate.</p>
        <p>It rained heavily after we boarded and there was some turbulence on route. However, everything was on time. We had to take a bus from the plane (even though it was parked at a gantry), but the bus took us directly to the passport control hall. Then our baggage arrived almost immediately. A call from the taxi driver told us where to meet him and we were home just before nine o'clock.</p>
