        <h1>Thursday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>We set off fairly early (in the drizzle) to Lidl in Shoreham, then to Dunelm for coffee and to look for a Christmas present for Kate and Dick. We didn't find anything, so we went on to M&S and also Tesco, where we bought some sweets, biscuits and drinks.</p>
        <p>For Angela, the afternoon was all about ironing! I started preparing a basis for a web page about our holiday with the family. However, Brandon messaged to say that he had been made redundant! Although he said that 'his role had been eliminated'.</p>
