        <h1>Thursday 1st August</h1>
        <p>Another warm day without the forecast thunderstorms.</p>
        <p>Mike W picked me up a little earlier than planned and took me to Rustington for the RCEA committee meeting. He delivered me home by about 12:15.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street and otherwise read and pottered in the garden. After lunch I did a little more research on fusion power (I keep finding more) and started planning the talk.</p>
