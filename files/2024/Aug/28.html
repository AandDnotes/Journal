        <h1>Wednesday 28th August</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day. She went walking as usual, ending up at the White Horse for the walking group lunch. Then she went to the table tennis club afternoon tea.</p>
        <p>I spent some of the morning 'playing' with my web page trying to make it work on a phone. But then I had a busy afternoon. I had booked an appointment to have new tyres fitted to the Panda, so I drove into Worthing. It seems that the traffic lights at Busticle Lane (Hillbarn) on the A27 had been damaged and the right turn was closed. So I had to go on to the Manor roundabout so as to come back along the A27.</p>
        <p>While the tyres were being changed I went to look around Worthing Museum. It is quite interesting. On the way back I called into Curry's and bought a 3.5mm jack to lightening adapter. I also bought some 'rubber' feet for the steps. Unfortunately, the queue from the Hillbarn is back to Lyons Farm!</p>
