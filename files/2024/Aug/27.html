        <h1>Tuesday 27th August</h1>
        <p>A sunny and calmer day, and quite warm. Angela made one of her frequent trips to the High Street to buy a few items of food. I did minor jobs and then integrated my holiday web page into our website. Later I found that github Pages doesn't seem able to handle heic image files. The images were displayed when I opened a local version, but not when it was loaded from github. png files worked. So I converted all the photos to jpg, uploaded them and edited the html file.</p>
        <p>As usual, Angela did some pottering in the garden, but I went to the dentist about my broken tooth. She pointed out that the tooth had two fillings, one metal and one some form of white material. So, although she could fill over the broken area, it would not last long. So she recommended having a crown. This involves removing the outside of the tooth, thus reducing its diameter, and then gluing the crown over it. The NHS metal crown costs over Â£300. She didn't say how much a ceramic one would cost. So I made an appointment for the initial work.</p>
