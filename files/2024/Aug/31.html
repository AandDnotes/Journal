        <h1>Saturday 31st August</h1>
        <p>The last day of meteorological summer. It was overcast, but reasonably warm. We started with a slightly later than usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. After reading some of the same, I did the weekly accounts and Angela worked in the garden, including cutting the front grass.</p>
        <p>After lunch I ran out of hearts (lives) after completing only one Dutch lesson. However, we spoke with Victoria. Gene and Claudia had arrived yesterday evening and they were planning to go shopping. I then added more to my 'how to' page on finances. It is all quite complicated!</p>
