        <h1>Monday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our 52nd wedding anniversary! We celebrated with (half) a bottle of wine with our dinner.</p>
        <p>While Angela was at her Monday club, I went to the Post Office to get some cash and to buy some euros. Then I discovered that Victoria's flight had been cancelled. Later, Paul had a message to say that they had booked on to a flight this afternoon to Chicago and fly to Amsterdam from there. So they should be at Paul's tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>While Angela cut the grass, I spent some more time working on my fusion talk. I fear that I will have too much to talk about! I also checked my battery beard trimmer and found that it did not work. Luckily I only needed to clean the contacts and put new batteries in it.</p>
