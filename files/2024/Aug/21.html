        <h1>Wednesday 21st August</h1>
        <p>Angela was up early and went out with the walking group. I spent most of the morning sorting out our finances covering the last two weeks. I had to log into the bank account to find out how much the various Euro purchases had cost. I also had to set maturity options on a couple of ISAs and note changes to interest rates on 'easy access' accounts. I also had a bank statement to reconcile against my spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Finances crept into the afternoon, while Angela did all the washing. Actually, between the finance tasks, I had to hang out the first load. Angela also cut the two rear lawns. Ian from opposite had cut our front grass for us and brought over part of a quiche, that we had for dinner (it actually wasn't very good, but well received).</p>
