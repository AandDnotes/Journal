        <h1>Thursday 15th August</h1>
        <p>A brighter day, although fresher than of late. Paul, Victoria, Brandon and I went off to Goude this morning, where they hold the weekly market. It was very busy. Paul bought some large stroopwafels and we looked at the other stalls. There was a large display of large Goude cheeses, with an 'oompah' band playing in the middle. We walked around some of the side streets before coming home.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a short walk. Actually, Rowan and Juniper skated. Krista, Angela and Brandon walked on further. We gave Juniper her transfer picture kit, which she thought was magic, and Austin his 'tractor in a tin'. He was quite interested in that, although he needed help from Paul (and later Brandon) for the fiddly bits. I think they only got half way through the 60 steps!</p>
