        <h1>Wednesday 7th August</h1>
        <p>WE spent the morning packing and waiting around until the taxi arrived just before one. Then it was off to Gatwick. We were through security by two!</p>
        <p>The flight was fine and we stopped for something to eat at Schiphol station. However, we then found that the fast train to Rotterdam was cancelled, after we had carried our cases down a stationary escalator! So then we had to move to another platform (down another static escalator) to catch the slow train.</p>
        <p>That journey was calm, but we had a bit of a wait at Rotterdam for the train to Goude. However, Paul arrived just as we were coming out of the station. So it was about 10:30 before we got to Berkenwoude.</p>
