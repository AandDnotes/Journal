        <h1>Wednesday 14th August</h1>
        <p>We had very heavy rain early this morning and then didn't get up until 8:30. We did little this morning and then, after lunch went off to take the ferry across the river Lek to Kinderdijk.</p>
        <p>It was a pity that it was spitting with rain. It was also a pity that none of the children wanted to go. Rowan said she had been before, Austin said it was boring and Juniper said it was too far to walk. Even an ice cream didn't help. So we were early getting to the restaurant on the banks of the river Issel where we had booked a table. It was a good meal and everyone seemed to enjoy it, even if Rowan had to go outside after the main course and Austin and Juniper were wrestling while waiting for desert.</p>
        <p>This meal was our delayed Golden Wedding meal from 2022! Although we will pay for quite a few more meals before we go home.</p>
