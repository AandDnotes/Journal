        <h1>Friday 30th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street I checked the pressures in the new tyres on the Panda and fitted the new feet to the small steps. I then 'tweaked' the web page for our visit to Berkenwoude so that it looked better, particularly on a phone. Before lunch I also started creating another 'how to' page, this time on viewing/updating our finance spreadsheets. I had previously captured some images.</p>
        <p>Later we went for a short walk, mainly to pick blackberries, but also to buy some wrapping paper for Kate's Christmas present. While picking blackberries in the playing field I found a cooking apple tree in the hedge, so picked three apples. Angela cooked a blackberry and apple crumble for pudding.</p>
