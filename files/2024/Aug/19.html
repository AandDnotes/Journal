        <h1>Monday 19th August</h1>
        <p>We were all up fairly early this morning, since we had to vacate the house in Cadzand by 10am. We actually left at a quarter to ten.</p>
        <p>A lot of the journey of about two and a half hours was on motorway, including going through quite a long tunnel. Greet and Wim were at Paul's when we arrived, but they left while we were taking our things upstairs.</p>
        <p>So lunch was followed by not very much and soon it was time for Paul to light the barbecue. However, Krista went to the supermarket and to the vet (for some flea treatment for Flo and Tom) and Victoria and Brandon went for a slightly longer walk than they had planned.</p>
        <p>The barbecue was good, but did not go quite as Paul had planned. After getting very hot, the barbecue cooled down just as he wanted to cook meats and corn. So the latter had to be finished off in the oven.</p>
        <p>Before dinner Krista phoned the hospital and arranged an appointment for early tomorrow afternoon for Austin to have his arm inspected. This will probably involve removing the cast, X-raying his arm and then fitting a new cast. After dinner I checked us both in for our flight back to Gatwick tomorrow evening. We will probably need to leave before the others get back from the hospital.</p>
