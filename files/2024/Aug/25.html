        <h1>Sunday 25th August</h1>
        <p>A brighter, but windy day. Angela went to church and I checked the Panda's tyre pressures. Three were very low, but the fourth (offside rear) was fine. I must check them again tomorrow. I also tried to jack up the garage roof. I could move the rafter, but the 4"x2" beam added by the roofer seemed to move up, so I couldn't get any shims between the two.</p>
        <p>Apart from reading the paper, Angela 'pottered' in the garden and I did some more on my Berkenwoude visit web page.</p>
        <p>After dinner we had a chat with Paul. They had been out to Marija's, since it was Danny's birthday. Rowan starts secondary school on Tuesday. I takes about 45 minutes to cycle there! The first four days involve a number of introductory things, as well as some sport. Most days are only half-days.</p>
