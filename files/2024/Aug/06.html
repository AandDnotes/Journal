        <h1>Tuesday 6th August</h1>
        <p>A rainy morning, but Angela walked down to the High Street to get some milk. Luckily it dried up and was even sunny later in the day. We also had a message from Paul to say that V et al had landed, got their luggage and picked up their car. Later he told us that they had arrived.</p>
        <p>We started getting out a few things to pack. I folded the shirts that I plan to take, since that takes some time. Later in the day I checked us both in and printed our boarding cards. I tried to move our seats from near the back to forward of the wing, but I must have missed a click and we ended up where we started.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a Teams call with Joanne Longton at the IET about possibly joining the CC-UK. It would be for a three-year term. I also told Katie and Tamsin that we were going away. They've not yet heard anything about their planning application, although they don't plan to do the work until next year.</p>
