        <h1>Tuesday 13th August</h1>
        <p>There was more cloud around today, although it was still hot. Paul took V&B to Goude this morning for to catch the train to Utrecht and then on to Cologne. He will pick them up this evening, quite late.</p>
        <p>So the day was spent with the three children playing and running around. This evening they are all sleeping in Rowan's room!</p>
        <p>I finished the first draft of my slides for the fusion talk. Also, the flying club said my proposed talk was too complicated for the members. Otherwise we did a lot of puzzles, games and marble runs.</p>
