        <h1>Saturday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>Whilst I walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper (and a courgette) and put some recycling items in the bins in the market, Angela took some cake to a coffee morning that she helped run at the church. As usual, I did the weekly accounts, but then read some of the paper and did a little more to my fusion presentation.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had what was probably the shortest chat with Victoria. Austin had completed all his badges at camp and showed us some of the metalwork and leather work that he did. We should be seeing them on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In connection with our planned visit to Berkenwoude, I retrieved the cases from the loft, checked how many euros we have (we need some more) and looked up the times of trains from Schiphol to Gouda (and back).</p>
