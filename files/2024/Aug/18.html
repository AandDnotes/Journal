        <h1>Sunday 18th August</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. It was dry, warm and sunny throughout. We set off for Bruges, with a target of an underground car park near the centre. It only took just over half an hour. Having parked, we walked around the city, calling into the cathedral, before finding one of the boat tour operators and going on a tour. It was quite a good way of seeing the city.</p>
        <p>We stoped for a meal in one of the many restaurants. It was fairly expensive, but good. Our intent had been to walk some more and then stopping for waffles and ice cream. However, we didn't get very far before coming across a waffle shop that only sold gluten free waffles. So we bought a variety of ice cream waffle cones and waffles with chocolate mouse and ate them in the street. By this time all the main streets were heaving with people, with the occasional car and bus and many bicycles and horse-drawn carriages trying to get through.</p>
        <p>We again stoped for coffee and hot chocolate before returning to the car and driving back to Cadzand.</p>
        <p>After a small snack (Angela and I just had some fruit) all but Brandon, Austin and I walked to a beach beyond the marina to look for 'shark's teeth'.</p>
