        <h1>Friday 16th August</h1>
        <p>We had a gentle morning, partly because it was raining and partly because we had to pack for our long weekend away. After an early lunch, Greet and Wim arrived to look after the animals until Krista's house sitter arrived later. Then we set off at about two o'clock for the drive south. It took about two and a half hours to drive down to near the Belgium border on the coast.</p>
        <p>Luckily (and as forecast) the rain had stopped by the time we got there and it was quite warm. Krista had booked a big house, divided into three separate, but joined (via lots of doors) on a sort of holiday development. All the houses are of the same style and there is a restaurant, shop, bar, small indoor pool, playground in the form of a wrecked ship, crazy golf and sports courts. One the three parts has a tower with a sort of mezzanine bedroom off one of the main bedrooms.</p>
        <p>We ate in the restaurant and then went for a walk to the beach, only about 600m away. There are a lot of places to eat in the town and it is a sandy beach. The whole place seems to be geared towards tourism and was busy, so the beach is probably crowded during the day. Krista, Rowan and Juniper went down to the sea and searched along the shoreline, while Austin did a bit of digging (with his left hand and feet) and we walked along the upper part of the beach for a short distance before walking back.</p>
        <p>There seems to be a shipping lane between the shore and a wind farm, with a good procession of container ships and RORO ferries.</p>
