        <h1>Saturday 17th August</h1>
        <p>A bright, sunny day and we set off fairly early to a beach about ten minutes away. We then had a bit of a walk down to an area of sand where Krista thought they might find 'shark's teeth'. It was a very large sandy beach and we stopped about half way to the sea.</p>
        <p>Some dug in the sand and then went off to the water's edge, while we sat in a 'sand bench' and then later in a pop-up tent. It was a bit boring, but we left just before lunchtime. Afterwards, Krista, Paul, Rowan and Juniper went off to the local beach to swim. The rest of us went off for walks. A and I walked around the holiday site and up to the marina, then along the main coast road with the shops. V, B and A walked around the site.</p>
        <p>Whilst out we picked up takeaway pizza menus and Brandon and I went up to the pizza restaurant and placed our order. He and Paul then went back to collect it. After eating, we walked back to buy ice cream. We eat too much.</p>
