        <h1>Sunday 4th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I answered a couple of email and then tested the MacBook connected to the TV as a second screen. I managed to find the options to show Keynote's 'presenter' view on the MacBook and the full-screen slides on the TV. So I should be able to see my notes and what slide is coming next. I also found some time to add a few more slides to the talk.</p>
        <p>Paul et al went to the cinema and so were quite late getting home, so we spoke to him after dinner.</p>
        <p>We spent the evening watch the Proms concert of American music. It was very good. Stephen Osbourne played Rhapsody in Blue.</p>
