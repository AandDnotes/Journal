        <h1>Friday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>A day of two halves. Rain in the morning and sunny in the afternoon, but windy all day. Angela went to the butchers, but otherwise cooked cakes and biscuits. I did some work on a web page about our trip to the Netherlands. I also had a reply from the person at UoS who is prepared to give a talk on autonomous vehicles.</p>
        <p>In the evening we went to Felicity's to 'chat' with the neighbours. Unfortunately we sat with Barbara, who doesn't stop talking. So we didn't speak with anyone else.</p>
