        <h1>Monday 12th August</h1>
        <p>A very hot day. Victoria, Brandon and Krista took Austin off to the hospital quite early. To our surprise they were back before lunch with Austin's arm in plaster. It seems that he had broken (cracked) both bones in his arm. He had three X-rays, before and after the cast was applied.</p>
        <p>So the rest of the day was spent sitting around, both indoors and out. I made some good progress with my slide set. The 'rockets' were not that popular. Juniper coloured half of hers, Austin coloured a little (with his left hand) and Rowan didn't start hers.</p>
