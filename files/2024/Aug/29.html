        <h1>Thursday 29th August</h1>
        <p>We set off a little later than usual, but instead of going to the supermarket we went to the RCEA coffee morning at the Swallows Return. Apparently there were more attendees than usual. It also turned out that they separate the husbands and wives, so that they can have their own conversations.  We then went on to the nearby Asda to do our shopping.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela trimmed two bushes in the front garden and cut the back grass. I then cut the bush on the corner of the drive.</p>
