        <h1>Monday 26th August</h1>
        <p>A bank holiday and mainly dry with a sunny afternoon. Angela walked to the High Street to buy a few things for our lunch and dinner and I completed my web page about our trip.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we trimmed a bay bush and the wisteria that is coming over from next door. I asked if I could trim the top and they said they would get the top cut back on Friday, when one of their mothers is coming.</p>
