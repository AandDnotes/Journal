        <h1>Sunday 11th August</h1>
        <p>A quieter day. Some went off early to take Austin to a medical centre in Goude. They were back early, with Austin's bandaged arm in a sling and instructions to phone the X-ray department early in the morning. Victoria then phoned their insurance company about the medical treatment.</p>
        <p>It was a hot sunny day. Paul, Angela and Brandon took Flo for a walk, then Brandon worked on his job application and I did some more to my fission talk.</p>
        <p>Later we had a barbecue and then played swing-ball. Later still, we watched the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, until the speeches started.</p>
