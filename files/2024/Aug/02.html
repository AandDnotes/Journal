        <h1>Friday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>Since we missed doing our weekly shop yesterday we went off this morning to Lyons Farm and then called in to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee. That took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I did the monthly accounts so as to save time tomorrow. I also cleaned off some bird droppings from the Panda.</p>
        <p>Later I started putting together my slides on fusion, trying out several slide styles.</p>
