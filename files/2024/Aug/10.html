        <h1>Saturday 10th August</h1>
        <p>Another interesting day. We had a quiet morning, but after lunch we (Paul and I) cycled to the playground on the outskirts of Berkenwoude. Paul took the children in the box-bike and the others walked there. I was quite 'wobbly'. Just as the others arrived so Austin fell off the see-saw and hurt his wrist. We brought them home, gave him paracetamol and put his arm in a sling. Later, Krista phoned the hospital and they suggested taking him there in the morning.</p>
        <p>Victoria emailed their travel insurer about their delayed departure and the extra cost of their hire car. She then phoned them about Austin.</p>
