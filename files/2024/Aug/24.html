        <h1>Saturday 24th August</h1>
        <p>We had to dress in our full wet weather gear this morning to go to the High Street to buy a newspaper and get some cash. It continued raining until after lunch and then gradually cleared to a blue sky.</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts and then added some to my draft web page for our trip to the Netherlands. After lunch we spoke with Victoria. When Austin had his new plaster cast they cut along its length and put tape over the cut so that the cast would have some 'give' when they were in the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Everyone at Bowery was told to stay at home and they would receive details of what would be happening to them. Brandon was one of about 30% who were made redundant. He has been given severance pay for the next 12 weeks.</p>
