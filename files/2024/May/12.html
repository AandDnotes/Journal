        <h1>Sunday 12th May</h1>
        <p>Another warm, sunny and calm day. While Angela was at church I spent most of the morning preparing and submitting the next IET email. Later I reconciled the bank statement against my accounts and Angela cut the grass.</p>
        <p>Later still we had a short chat with Paul. They had visitors today.</p>
