        <h1>Saturday 18th May</h1>
        <p>We walked to the High Street to get a newspaper and a couple of other things. I then went on to the library to use their internet connection to book rail tickets and parking for Monday. ThenI went to the optician. She was running a bit late, but all was well and they will refer me to SpaMedica on Monday.</p>
        <p>The sun was trying to come out by the time I got home and Angela was doing more work in the garden. I did the weekly accounts before lunch.</p>
        <p>We were expecting someone from Virgin Media to come this afternoon. Since no one arrived I phoned VM again, only to find that they are coming on Monday, between 8 and one. I will be out and Angela will have to miss her  Monday club.</p>
