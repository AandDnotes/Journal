        <h1>Thursday 30th May</h1>
        <p>Today, as usual on a Thursday, was mainly about the weekly supermarket shop. We started at Lidl in Worthing, followed by coffee and a few items from Waitrose. We then wandered into the town to B&M and Superdrug, getting caught in a hail storm on the way.</p>
        <p>After lunch I zipped up the CoCo installation files, uploaded it to Dropbox and shared the folder with Keith and Greg. I also investigated the IET risk assessment document and downloaded the Key Stage 2/3 Computing syllabus.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon Jason, from Steyning Roofing called to look at the garage roof. He thought that he could fit a piece of 6x2 timber to support the joists over the window and will give a separate price for replacing the boarding. What is there will probably loose its surface when the old felt is removed. He said that the old felt is very brittle.</p>
