        <h1>Monday 6th May</h1>
        <p>May bank holiday, but a mainly wet one. Angela was up early again, making another squidgy chocolate role for the flower festival lunches. I checked in to our flights tomorrow morning and printed off our boarding cards.</p>
        <p>Angela went down to the church (with her cakes and roll) while I sorted out things to pack for tomorrow. I then went down at about 10:30 to take up my role as lunch ticket seller. I got home at about 3:30 (after lunch), with Angela arriving about an hour later having taken down her posters for the festival. We are both tired and not looking forward to an early start in the morning.</p>
