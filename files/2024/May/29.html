        <h1>Wednesday 29th May</h1>
        <p>For me, the main activity today was to prepare for a Teams meeting in the evening. Angela was busier, she went off early, walking at Sullington with her friends. Then after lunch she went to the church to help provide refreshments for another Steyning Festival event.</p>
        <p>After dinner I held the Teams meeting. Although I thought I had sent the invite to only a few people, it seems that it went to everyone on the committee. So Greg and Dave P joined as well as Ian Marshall and Keith McFarlane.</p>
