        <h1>Tuesday 14th May</h1>
        <p>It was still raining when we got up, but it soon stopped and stayed dry for the rest of the day. Angela went off to Storrington on the bus to bank her Lunch Club cash.</p>
        <p>After updating the iMac OS, I moved the TC out on to the drive, swept the garage floor and replaced the oil drip catching cardboard under the car. Then it was a case of doing odd things. Mike W has his operation date and can get to the Steyning Festival talks, so I booked my tickets. I also corresponded about the potential for running a workshop at Upper Beeding Primary School.</p>
        <p>After lunch I felt very tired, even though I had quite a good night's sleep. So I didn't get much done other than our daily set of Dutch lessons. So not a particularly productive day.</p>
