        <h1>Thursday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. Then we went on to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee. We got home in time to make lunch.</p>
        <p>I then spent most of the afternoon logging in to each of the bank/building society web sites with which we have savings accounts. I checked that my records of what we have, actually matches what the bank/building societies think.</p>
