        <h1>Tuesday 7th May</h1>
        <p>We were up at 4:30 and left the house at 5:15 to drive to Gatwick. By the time we got through security we had to go straight to the gate. The plane too off early and we arrived at Schiphol 20 minutes early. We then had trouble getting a train, since the next Intercity Direct was cancelled. So we caught the slower train and Paul and Rowan met us at Capelsebrug.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was just sitting around feeling tired.</p>
