        <h1>Wednesday 1st May</h1>
        <p>As usual, Angela went out with her walking group while I worked on the monthly accounts. It took a lot of effort, particularly after all the transactions I did due to two accounts maturing without me setting the maturity options and therefore needing to open new accounts and move money around. At the end I wasn't completely convinced that I had all the accounts and only the actual accounts in my spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I had a brief Teams meeting with Dan and Ciaran about the possibility of holding a competition.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre to see 'Wonka'. It was very entertaining, but there were only about 30 people in the audience.</p>
