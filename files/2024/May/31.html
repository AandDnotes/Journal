        <h1>Friday 31st May</h1>
        <p>It was cloudy and quite chilly, but just about dry. Angela went to the High Street, meeting lots of people to talk to, while I 'played' with a risk assessment for the Control Technologies workshop. I also joined a UTM forum, asked how I could move the iso image, got a reply within an hour and solved the problem.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning a man from Apex Roofing called to look at the garage roof. It seems that it is about 48 square meters. He can also prop up the joists over the window. I should get a quote next week. Again, he said that he would provide a cost for replacing the 'boarding' separately.</p>
        <p>I finished making a cardboard spool for a magnetic actuator coil, measured out 40 meters of wire and started winding the coil.</p>
