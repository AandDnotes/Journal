        <h1>Tuesday 28th May</h1>
        <p>A more productive, but very wet day. Angela went down to the High Street without getting too wet while I created a new virtual machine on the iMac and installed Windows 11. It took most of the morning, but I also installed CoCo.</p>
        <p>After lunch I booked the Panda into Simms for a replacement timing belt (and water pump). Then I phoned Steyning Roofing and Apex Roofing and arranged for them to call to look at the garage roof.</p>
        <p>We walked down to St Andrews for a concert. Unfortunately we missed the first piece because it started at 4:30, but the programme said five o'clock. What we did hear was very good. The viola player was from the Hanover Band, who was accompanied on the piano by Brian next door. Brian also played a piece by Bach on the organ.</p>
