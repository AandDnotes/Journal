        <h1>Thursday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>A complete change in the weather. It was warm(ish), dry and mainly sunny. In fact, we didn't need a coat, just a thin sweater. Although our main aim was to do the weekly grocery shop, we started by going to Squires garden centre, primarily to get some compost, using a voucher. Angela also bought a plant, a packet of seeds and a present for Kate.</p>
        <p>We then went into Worthing to Lidl and then Waitrose, before going into the centre to take an ISA maturity form to Nationwide and to buy a few things. We were later than usual home and so had a slightly late lunch.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I started washing the garage door. I did the edges and the joints between the horizontal sections and then washed half of the panels. Hopefully I will get the remainder done tomorrow.</p>
