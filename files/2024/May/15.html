        <h1>Wednesday 15th May</h1>
        <p>Another warm, sunny day. Angela went off walking with her friends and I produced the start slide for next week's IET talk (the last before summer), sending it to Deshi, together with a template for the attendance list. That took me most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleaned the gutters and facias along the front of the house. I need to do the other three sides and then the garage.</p>
        <p>We had an early dinner and then walked to the Steyning Centre for a meeting about a proposed housing development at Glebe Farm. Lots of people attended and it was very hot. They had to turn some people away. The proposal seems to go against all the things that should be considered by planners.</p>
