        <h1>Thursday 9th May</h1>
        <p>A sunny and warm morning.Paul and I investigated the dividing wall in the cottage. The ends are getting damp, so we removed a small piece of plaster to reveal the mortar joint and measured the depth of drill that would be needed to drill a series of holes into which silicone could be injected. Paul found a suitable, but old, masonry bit.</p>
        <p>After lunch we played a game of Cluedo and then went to Schoonhoven for dinner by the river. We sat outside, but in the shade.</p>
