        <h1>Thursday 9th May</h1>
        <p>A sunny and warm morning. Paul and I investigated the dividing wall in the cottage. The ends are getting damp, so we removed a small piece of plaster to reveal the mortar joint and measured the depth of drill bit that would be needed to drill a series of holes into which silicone could be injected. Paul found a suitable, but old, masonry bit. However, he later decided to buy a new bit,</p>
        <p>Angela went off to watch Rowan at her tennis lesson while Krista went to the supermarket.</p>
        <p>After lunch we played a game of Cluedo and then went to Schoonhoven for dinner by the river. We sat outside, but in the shade. It was a good evening.</p>
