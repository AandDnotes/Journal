        <h1>Monday 20th May</h1>
        <p>The Virgin Media fibre cable contractor arrived before eight o'clock this morning, while we were still eating breakfast. By 8:30 our broadband was working again. They had to replace the fibre from the box down to our house.</p>
        <p>I then went off to catch the 9:43 train from Shoreham to join the 'London walk' group. We spent quite a long time in the Shakespeare pub having coffee before we set off by tube to the start of the Regent Canal walk. It was warm and sunny all day. We stopped for lunch at Camden Lock, which was not particularly good. In fact, the whole area around there is spoilt by graffiti and litter. I got home just before nine o'clock.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went to her Monday club.</p>
