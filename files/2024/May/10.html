        <h1>Friday 10th May</h1>
        <p>Another warm, calm and sunny day. We went with Rowan and Paul for a walk around the Berkenwouder Triangle. We saw lots of ducklings and goslings. Then it was back for coffee and cake.</p>
        <p>After lunch Greet and Wim came, for more coffee and cake.</p>
        <p>Later, Paul took us to Gouder, where we caught the train into Rotterdam and picked up the Intercity Direct train to Schiphol. There were plenty of seats and Schiphol security was very quiet, so we had about an hour and a half spare time. We had a snack and then caught the 21:25 flight back to Gatwick. We arrived home at about 11:15 and turned on the house. All was well.</p>
