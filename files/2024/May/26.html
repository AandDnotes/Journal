        <h1>Sunday 26th May</h1>
        <p>After overnight rain, luckily it stayed dry, with a fair amount of sunshine. While Angela went to church I looked up some payments into our current account and updated the accounts and shares spreadsheets. Then I went into the garage and put together a former for a new coil. Although I started measuring out 35 m of 40 swg wire, I finished that after lunch and would the coil. Unfortunately, while dismantling the former, one of the wires broke off! I will need to see if I can find the end and try to unwind a little.</p>
        <p>Although we spoke with Paul of Wednesday, we had a catch-up this afternoon.</p>
