        <h1>Tuesday 21st May</h1>
        <p>Although I planned to clean the garage door today, it rained on and off. So I stayed inside. Also, it was not particularly warm.</p>
        <p>A lot of today was about catching up with odds and ends associated with not having internet access for four days. Angela worked in the garden, between showers. I emailed the person who is interested in helping with a control technologies workshop.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunchtime since I went to Falmer for the final talk in the IET Sussex season. We didn't have many people there, but I think the audience found it interesting. Dan did the recording. Hooray!</p>
