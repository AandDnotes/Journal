        <h1>Friday 24th May</h1>
        <p>A busy, but enjoyable day. And it stayed dry with some sunshine. While Angela went to the High Street to get her hair cut, I finished cleaning the garage door and then lubricated the hinges and pulleys. We then took the TC to Small Dole to meet other WSMGOC members for lunch at The Fox pub. It was a good meal.</p>
        <p>Since we were without a broadband connection last weekend, we spoke to Victoria today. The children had a day off school. Then we went to the Methodist Church; Angela to help make teas and coffees and me to listen to the talk. The speaker was very good, making a complex subject accessible to a general audience.</p>
