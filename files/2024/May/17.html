        <h1>Friday 17th May</h1>
        <p>Since we had no Internet access we walked down to the library to use their wi-fi. We gained access, so we could do a few Duolingo lessons, but I couldnâ€™t get  connections to either my Google Mail or iCloud mail accounts. The Windows 365 account was fine. So I accessed my Google mail via the browser, which worked well enough. While I was doing this Angela went to the butchers. Before coming home we went to the slightly odd shop in the High Street, that has a range of gift-type items and serves coffee. We just had coffee before coming home. It was lunchtime by then.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went for a dental checkup and then potted-on some plants, before working in the front garden. I put oil on the garden table and then cleaned the gutters and wiped down the gutters, facias and door/window at the back. Just before I had finished the Virgin Media man arrived. He opened the black box on the front wall and said that the fibre input was showing red rather than green. He also tested the fibre and said that there was no signal. He concluded that somewhere between us and the box (or at the box) our fibre had been disturbed. The box is near number 82. So he booked for someone to come tomorrow, between one and six, to fix it or install a new fibre.</p>
        <p>We finished off by pruning (quite severely) bushes by the pavement in the corner of our front garden.</p>
