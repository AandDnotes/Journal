        <h1>Wednesday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>Although it rained a lot during the day (and quite heavily at times), Angela managed to stay dry on her morning walk from Lancing Green to Brooklands and back. I also stayed dry on my walk to the High Street to get my hair cut. Angela is having hers cut on Friday, so I thought I would get in on the act.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day involved a lot of reading and attempting puzzles. I read about FreeRTOS and Angela did sudoku and crosswords. After dinner we had a FaceTime call with Paul and Rowan, since our broadband had been down on Sunday (our usual time for a chat).</p>
