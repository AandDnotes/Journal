        <h1>Sunday 5th May</h1>
        <p>The day started sunny. I took the TC down to the High Street for the Vintage Revival. I had been offered a spot in the Star car park, so I went there at 9:15 via the bypass. It was quiet there.</p>
        <p>After walking to the other end of the High Street I met the organiser and arranged to use one of the spare spots left by people pulling out. So I moved the TC to opposite the old Barclays Bank. It was very busy and I spent all morning talking to other car owners and to visitors. Then Angela came by and, after walking up and down the High Street, we walked home for lunch.</p>
        <p>There was some drizzle, so I put the hood up before we went home. After lunch I walked back down. It was still busy, in spite of the occasional drizzle. I displayed a small sign saying that the car was for sale and one of the other car owners (he was showing a TR6) expressed some interest. Earlier I had given the owner of the car next to me some water, but when we came to leave, his car would not start. So I moved the TC and 'rounded-up' four other men to help push the car into parking lane. He arranged for a recovery service to rescue him.</p>
        <p>When I got home we spoke to Paul and then to Victoria. Then I dried off the TC.</p>
        <p>Overall it was a good day.</p>
