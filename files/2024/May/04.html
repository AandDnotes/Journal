        <h1>Saturday 4th May</h1>
        <p>Angela was up early to make a chocolate 'squidgy' roll. She then walked down to the high Street to buy some raspberries (for the chocolate roll) and a newspaper. We then carried a chocolate cake, two bara briths and the chocolate roll down to the church. Luckily it was a sunny day.</p>
        <p>Angela went straight into the kitchen to help prepare lunches and I was asked to welcome visitors to the flower festival and gave out the list of flower arrangements. Then I sold lunch tickets. We finally had our lunch just after two and I got home at 3:30. Angela arrived home at 4:30.</p>
        <p>Then it was a case of making bread, doing our Dutch lessons and doing the weekly accounts. i also 'played' a little more withe the Ninox database.</p>
