        <h1>Monday 13th May</h1>
        <p>No (or very little) sunshine today. However, it did stay dry. Angela went off early to help prepare for the lunch club and I put water repellent on the wets-facing garage wall. That involved moving the bin store, brushing the wall and then painting the solution on the wall.</p>
        <p>I went down for about 12:30 and sat with Harold, Ann, John and another woman. Afterwards, Angela went to the health centre to get new hearing aids and then came back to the church kitchen. We got home at about three.</p>
        <p>Later I went to the WSMGOC club night at the Frankland Arms.</p>
