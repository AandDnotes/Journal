        <h1>Monday 27th May</h1>
        <p>Following overnight rain it was a dry day apart from a brief shower. Not bad for a bank holiday. So Angela spent a lot of time in the garden, planting up hanging baskets.</p>
        <p>I started by creating a Teams meeting for Wednesday on the Control Technologies workshop. So I then updated the Windows OS (in a virtual machine) on the MacBook, which took quite a long time. The CoCo software then worked, apart from the sound. Then I tried to do the same on the iMac, but I had to log in to Microsoft before it would let me update. The update also took a long time, but then it asked me to sign in, but wouldn't do anything, even after restarting the VM! So I downloaded a new image of the Windows OS.</p>
