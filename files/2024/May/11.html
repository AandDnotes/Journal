        <h1>Saturday 11th May</h1>
        <p>Austin's birthday and another warm, sunny day. But we started by going to the village. I bought a newspaper and some food items and Angela went to the Christian Aid coffee morning, mainly to buy plants. I caught her up and had coffee and cake. Then I went home to do exciting things like the weekly accounts, while Angela stayed to hear the raffle draw. She didn't win anything.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe at Beeding Village Hall. It was fairly quiet, but we had a steady stream of repairs. When I got back we spoke with Austin. He was quite chatty, although he was building one of his new Lego models as we were talking.</p>
