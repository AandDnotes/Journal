        <h1>Sunday 19th May</h1>
        <p>Another dry and sunny day. In fact it got quite warm. While Angela was at church I sorted out the audio files from Graeme Aâ€™s talk. I put the on a memory stick that I can give to him tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Then I spent a lot of the day wiping down facias. I brushed the end facias and wiped the patio door frame. Then I cleaned out the garage gutter and wiped the gutter and facias all round, including the frame to the door. Now just the door to clean.</p>
        <p>It was odd not talking to Victoria and Paul. Virgin Media sent a text to confirm that someone will come tomorrow and that we do not need to be at home. So Angela can go to her Monday club.</p>
        <p>I had a little play at preparing a former to help make a coil for a magnetic actuator.</p>
