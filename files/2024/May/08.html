        <h1>Wednesday 8th May</h1>
        <p>Rowan's birthday. She started by following a 'treasure map' to find her various presents. Then Paul and I finished fitting the dishwasher.</p>
        <p>After lunch, Wander and the two cousins arrived, followed by Greet and Wim. We played some games and eat cake.</p>
        <p>Later, after some experimentation, I managed to enrol Dan as a 'master' on our YouTube channel.</p>
