        <h1>Friday 3rd May</h1>
        <p>Luckily it stayed dry today and, in fact, brightened up during the afternoon. Angela spent the morning at the church, helping to set things up for the flower festival that starts tomorrow. I spent a lot of the morning looking at ways of simplifying my records of our finances. Although I installed a 'free' database application to explore, I came to the conclusion that it was best to improve my description of the various spreadsheets. I made up an image of screenshots of various pars to directory structures and spreadsheets and added it to my 'finances' web page.</p>
        <p>Angela spent the afternoon cutting the lawns and tidying up int eh garden. At one point the back door key and the garage key went missing, but Angela later found them in another coat pocket. I took the TC for a figure of eight run and then spent a little while experimenting with the Ninox database.</p>
