        <h1>Thursday 16th May</h1>
        <p>Being Thursday, we set off to do the weekly supermarket shop. Since Angela wanted to get some bird food in Worthing, we went to Lidle and then to Waitrose, where we had coffee. After going to B&amp;M Angela remembered some other things we needed and so we went back into Waitrose, buying more than the first time. We stopped at Sainsbury’s on the way home to get some petrol.</p>
        <p>When we got home we noticed that the router was flashing green (it should have been solid white). When I was finally able to log into the router (for some reason it had reverted to the default password) it said that the RF signal could not be detected. It took a while to find a number to phone. I had to use a non-Virgin Media web site! After a struggle to provide the authentication information that they wanted (it seems that somewhere I have a memorable word) they arranged for someone to call tomorrow between 4 and 7.</p>
        <p>So we couldn’t do our Dutch lessons or watch anything on catchup. Also, my phone, with data turned on, struggled to access anything. Sometimes, upstairs, the signal was strong enough for a web page to appear. So we read and watched TV programmes that would would probably not have otherwise watched.</p>
