        <h1>Saturday 25th May</h1>
        <p>We walked to the High Street twice this morning. Firstly we went to buy a newspaper and then, after coffee, we went to Fletchers Croft to see what was going on for the Festival. As we arrived so there was a procession of children with drummers and people carrying branches, although the display of electric vehicles and bikes was a bit disappointing. We also had a quick look in the Brotherhood Hall at part of the Arts Trail.</p>
        <p>Angela cut the grass and I tried to clear some of the weeds on the drive. I used the wire brush, the hot-air gun and a spade before giving up, but Angela is not keen on me using weed killer. I then did the weekly accounts.</p>
