        <h1>Friday 29th March</h1>
        <p>Good Friday and a fairly productive day. Also, although the ground was wet when we got up, it stayed dry and became quite sunny and warm. I cleared the part of the garage where the wall cabinet had been, assembled the new shelving and fixed it in place. I then put things back, apart from those things that we want to give away. Meanwhile, Angela did some cleaning.</p>
        <p>Angela went for a short walk, mainly to see what had been done yesterday while Penlands Way was closed, and I tidied up the drive, removing some large weeds and a lot of sycamore seeds. I also swept parts of the garage floor, cleared the 'debris' by the back door of the garage and lubricated all the wheels and hinges on the garage door.</p>
