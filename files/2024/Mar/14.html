        <h1>Thursday 14th March</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual outing to do the weekly shop. After going to Sainsbury's we went on to the newly opened Findon Vale Garden Centre. They are still rebuilding part of it, but we bought a bird-feeding stand and a few feeders. WE also had coffee.</p>
        <p>Luckily it was sunny(ish) and mild, so we put the bird-feeding stand together and 'planted' it. I also fixed some netting to the wall in the walled garden so as to extend the climbing area.</p>
        <p>Then I tried to renew my driving licence online. But it said that it couldn't validate my identity and that a new photo for my driving licence was required. Why they can't use the photo from my passport I don't know. I will try again tomorrow.</p>
