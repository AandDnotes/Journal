        <h1>Sunday 31st March</h1>
        <p>Easter Day. So Angela went to church as usual. I spent some time trying to find out why my magnet coil is not attracting magnets, but without success.</p>
        <p>When both Victoria and Paul said they couldn't talk after lunch, we went for a walk in the sunshine, just going down the side of the Rifle Range and back along Mill Lane.</p>
        <p>Then we spoke, firstly with Paul and then, after dinner, with Victoria. Gene and Claudia are helping them refit their basement rooms.</p>
