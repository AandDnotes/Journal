        <h1>Saturday 9th March</h1>
        <p>Not so sunny today. In fact it rained a little this morning, so it was good that I went out in the TC yesterday. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some milk. Then I did the weekly and monthly accounts (I had forgotten to do these last Saturday). Then I started putting the video files from Tuesday's talk into iMovie.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was off to the Repair Cafe. We started briskly, but then it quietened down, in fact quieter than I seen it before. I replaced a fuse in a lamp and then spent quite some time trying to get a toaster apart. One of the other volunteers found some guidance on YouTube, but after getting some of the case apart the owners decide not to bother. Otherwise I helped others to get things apart.</p>
