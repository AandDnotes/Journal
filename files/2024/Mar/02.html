        <h1>Saturday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>Luckily we took umbrellas with us on our walk to the High Street, although the rain did stop around lunchtime. I think it was only the weekly accounts that I did during the rest of the morning, although I did read quite a bit of the paper.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, although, as usual, she did most of the talking. I then spent some time trying to set up for drawing a circuit diagram for my magnetic actuator project.</p>
        <p>Then we changed and went to Tottington Manor for the WSMGOC Annual Dinner. There were a lot of people there and the meal was quite good, although the drinks were expensive. We got home at about eleven o'clock.</p>
