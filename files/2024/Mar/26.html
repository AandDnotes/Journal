        <h1>Tuesday 26th March</h1>
        <p>Today didn't quite turn out as expected. The morning was fine, not really doing a great deal, although we did our Dutch lessons rather than the usual time of after lunch. We set off just before 11:30 to Worthing Hospital, where I dropped off Angela for her to go to the day surgery ward (Chanctonbury). She was feeling very nervous.</p>
        <p>I then went off to Dan's house to drink tea and look at the wireless microphones that he had bought. I met his boisterous black labrador, one of his two cats and his eldest son. I brought the microphones home to 'play' with them. I came home for lunch and to wait for a call from the hospital to say that Angela was waiting to be collected.</p>
        <p>At around three o'clock the call came, but I was told that Angela had not had the operation. So I set off in the rain and heavy traffic, arriving at the Chanctonbury ward just before four. It seems that the doctor thought that the grommets would not last long, would probably make no difference and might even make things worse. Apparently he said "if you were my mother I wouldn't advise having the operation. So she didn't!"</p>
        <p>We came home through the rain and the traffic, arriving at around five and had a cup of tea.</p>
