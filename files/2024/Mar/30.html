        <h1>Saturday 30th March</h1>
        <p>It turned out to be a fine, sunny day on Paul's birthday. Before we went out I transferred some cash into Paul's account and emailed him. However, I noticed that Angela's monthly savings had not left the bank. After a walk to the High Street and a little read of the paper, Angela cut the two back lawns and I investigated the regular savings account. Only Angela's January and February payments had been made and there was no active standing order. I couldn't find old SOs, so I couldn't tell if I'd made a mistake when setting them up, but mine was okay. So I set up a new SO for the rest of the year. Then it was my usual Saturday job of updating the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cut the front grass and then took the TC for a run; hood down and wide-brimmed hat on. I did 18 miles, down Clays Hill, along the bypass, up to Ashurst and then Partridge Green, then down through Henfield and Small Dole. There were only a couple of wet spots and the car ran well.</p>
