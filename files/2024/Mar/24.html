        <h1>Sunday 24th March</h1>
        <p>It was a reasonably warm, sunny day. As usual, Angela went to church and this afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. I spent some of the day working on my magnetic actuator project. After working out how to get the data types right in my calculation of the pulse width I managed to get an output to the coil, as seen on my oscilloscope, as I wanted it. Now I have to find if the coil affects a magnet.</p>
