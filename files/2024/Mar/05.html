        <h1>Tuesday 5th March</h1>
        <p>It rained until mid afternoon, which was not expected. Luckily it stopped raining by the time I went to Crawley, although there was some rain on the way.</p>
        <p>During the day I researched H-bridge ICs and ordered one for my experimentation. Then I added the H-bridge to my circuit drawing, with the connections to the Arduino.</p>
        <p>In the evening, while I went to Crawley, Angela helped at an event at the church, making tea and coffee. I attended, and recorded, a talk on the history of the railways in general and in the South in particular, by the curator of the Bluebell Railway Museum. Interesting, but little in the way of technology.</p>
