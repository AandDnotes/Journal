        <h1>Wednesday 6th March</h1>
        <p>During the morning I transferred the video files from the camera's SD card to the iMac and ran them through Handbrake to convert them to 1080p and 30 fps.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I checked the tyre pressures on both cars and charged the battery on the MG. Later in the afternoon we walked to Sandi and John's for a meal. It was a good evening, even if it was a little chilly walking home.</p>
