        <h1>Monday 25th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at her Monday club I received my new driving licence and Krista's code from her bank. So I photo'd it and sent it to her. I then 'played' with my magnetic actuator, getting some good traces on my oscilloscope and photographing them.</p>
        <p>Angela had a phone call from Worthing Hospital offering her an appointment tomorrow! We said yes, then realised that she would not be able to drive me back from Sayers Common on Wednesday. So I phoned them to rearrange my appointment to 4th April.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked to the High Street so that Angela could buy a book from a charity shop to take with her tomorrow. Later I arranged to go to Dan's tomorrow to pick up the microphone to test with the video camera.</p>
