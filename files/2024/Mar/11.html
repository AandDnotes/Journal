        <h1>Monday 11th March</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to the church to start cooking for the lunch club. I spent the morning creating the next Adestra email. It was approved later in the day. Then I went down to the church to help set up. I was sitting in for Phylis today, taking the money. It was a pity that we only had 17 people, including the helpers! We were home at about 3:30.</p>
        <p>A little later I went to the WSMGOC meeting (actually the AGM) at Washington and was home by nine o'clock.</p>
