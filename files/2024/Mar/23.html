        <h1>Saturday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>Angela hung the washing out before we walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a couple of other things. She then wrote a letter and I did the weekly accounts. It started raining just as she was setting off to post it. So I brought the washing in. Luckily it had been breezy and the washing was nearly dry. We then had a number of quite heavy showers.</p>
        <p>We had our usual chat with Victoria. It seems that Juniper's piano teacher has said she is not ready for lessons. She wouldn't practice and hid when the teacher arrived! Neither of them seem to want to do anything other than play games on their iPads.</p>
        <p>After it stopped raining I spent a short while in the garage and sorted out another apple box. What was left from the two boxes is now in one plastic box.</p>
