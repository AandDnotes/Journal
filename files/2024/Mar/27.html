        <h1>Wednesday 27th March</h1>
        <p>Today revolved around a trip to the tip. I booked a slot at Shoreham tip for 3pm. While Angela went walking with her friends I dismantled the pasting table and loaded the 'rubbish' into the back of the car. I also put some of the pieces of wood from my wood box into the car.</p>
        <p>Just before three we set off for the tip and spent some time unloading the car. Luckily, after some heavy rain around lunchtime, it was fine for the rest of the afternoon. On the way home there had been an accident by the Erringham Farm turn, so there was quite a queue.</p>
