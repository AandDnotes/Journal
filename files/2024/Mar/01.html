        <h1>Friday 1st March</h1>
        <p>February was the wettest month on record and today didn't bode well for March. The first day of meteorological spring started wet and then moved to heavy showers. And it wasn't very warm.</p>
        <p>My aim today was to start doing some serious work on my magnetic actuator project. However, I spent a lot of the day on IET business. I produced the start slide and sent it to Mike. Then I produced a speaker certificate, having some difficulty with the printing. Dan H wanted comments on yesterday evening's meeting with the U of S students. Then he asked me to put his email into Adestra.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela went off to the Hub with Barbara. She got home just before four. I did, however, do a little research on the construction of the actuator.</p>
