        <h1>Saturday 16th March</h1>
        <p>The day started sunny, with a clear blue sky, but finished raining quite heavily. We started by going to the High Street to post my driving licence renewal and to buy a paper. I then spent a lot of the morning doing the weekly accounts and reconciling the bank statement.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Victoria after lunch. Brandon has heard (from some ex colleagues) that a competitor may be about to take over his company. The down side is that they would close down the research farm (where Brandon works). Their research farm is in Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Then I had just a short play with my magnetic actuator project.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to to a flying club indoor flying session at Worthing High School. Initially my plane bound to someone else's transmitter! A little later (presumably after they had turned off their transmitter) I was able to get it bound. I still had trouble getting it off the ground. Clive was able to fly it, but it has to be going quite fast to get off the ground and stay in the air. Some collisions with the ground resulted in one of the canbane struts breaking off. So I had a nasty drive home. The A27 was closed, so I had to come over the Bostal, in the fog.</p>
