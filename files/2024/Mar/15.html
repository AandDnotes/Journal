        <h1>Friday 15th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street and library, I once again tried to renew my driving licence online, but it failed again, saying that it couldn't verify my identity. I got through to a person via a chat and he said that the problem was the difference in the form of my name between the licence and my passport. I'm not convinced. Anyway, I went down to the Post Office to get 'passport' photos taken (which cost £8.50). I then completed the renewal form and fixed one of the photos to it.</p>
        <p>I phoned Virgin Media about the increase in cost (from £29 to £66 per month and then to £72 in April) and eventually spoke to someone who said we could have the same service on an 18 month contract for £47 per month.</p>
        <p>Later I remade the circuit for my magnetic actuator project.</p>
