        <h1>Tuesday 12th March</h1>
        <p>I went off early to the opticians. I thought it would just be a case of her referring me for cataract removal, but she did a (nearly) full test. She then told me the procedure and I received the email from the NHS later in the morning. I also bought from them an eye hot compress and some wipes to help get ride of my blepharitis. Angela went off a little later to buy one or two things in the High Street and then go to the church to help Kathy set up for Gordon's memorial service. In fact, we passed in Godstalls Lane.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela returned to finish setting up and I drove Barbara (next door but one) to the church. It was quite a moving service, with a full church. I don't think our grandchildren would give comparable eulogies. Most people then went into the hall for some sandwiches/cake, tea/coffee and a chat. I brought Barbara home at about 3:30 and Angela got home later.</p>
