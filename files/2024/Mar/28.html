        <h1>Thursday 28th March</h1>
        <p>Angela started with an early visit to the butcher. We then set off to Lyons Farm. I bought a set of plastic shelving in Argos and then helped Angela with the weekly shop. From there we went to the Findon Vale garden centre for coffee and to buy a few bulbs. Angela also got a 'card' and had our last purchase added to it.</p>
        <p>My 2mm magnets arrived in the post, so I cut a piece of thin ply, drilled a 2mm (actually 1/8th of an inch) hole in it and put two magnets in it. When I put the end with the magnets in my toothbrush coil, with an oscillating voltage, nothing happened! The oscilloscope shows the voltage pulse width varying with the position of the stick, but I will need to measure the current going through the coil.</p>
        <p>I also phoned Jamie Cripps at Milestone Classics about selling the TC. He asked me to send photos, so I emailed him links to the Octagon Club advert and the TC's website.</p>
