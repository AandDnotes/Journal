        <h1>Sunday 17th March</h1>
        <p>The day started wet, but after lunch started to dry up and became sunny for a while. Luckily the forecast for tomorrow (for the London walk) is fine.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I prepared a start slide for Tuesday's talk and then produced a design for the sketch to drive a magnetic actuator. After lunch I started writing the code before we spoke with Paul.</p>
