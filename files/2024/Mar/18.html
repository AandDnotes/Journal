        <h1>Monday 18th March</h1>
        <p>A long and tiring day that was mostly cloudy. I set off just after nine to pick up Peter and Mike and drive to Shoreham station. We bet up with the other London walkers at Victoria, but the Shakespeare pub was closed, so we bought a coffee in Starbucks. Expensive and in a paper cup! We then walked to Temple tube station to started our walk around the Inns of Court. Actually we sauntered around the two mile route, meeting lots of barristers in their gowns and wigs. It seems that 93 new KCs were appointed today in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey.</p>
        <p>We then walked to a pub for dinner, but we were quite early so we had an early dinner and sat there for quite a while before walking on to Victoria station. I dropped off Mike and Peter and got home at ten to nine.</p>
