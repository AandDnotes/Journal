        <h1>Monday 4th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club I worked on my magnetic actuator project. I wired up the Arduino and wrote a sketch to display the voltage from the stick. It took a while to refresh my memory about how to get values displayed, particularly since the Arduino IDE has been substantially upgraded. To take it further it looks as though I will need to buy an H-Bridge chip.</p>
        <p>During the day I also set up online access to my Close Brothers ISA (again) and set the maturity option. Then I received the MG services spreadsheet from Colin and checked the location of a paint shop in Storrington.</p>
