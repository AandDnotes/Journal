        <h1>Monday 19th March</h1>
        <p>The post that arrived this morning included a Halifax letter for Krista. We were expecting just a code, but it was a device into which she needs to enter the code so as to generate another code to sign in to online banking. So I took it to the Post Office and sent it to Krista.</p>
        <p>We ate at lunchtime, since I went to an IET talk in the evening. I downloaded the attendance list and printed it.</p>
        <p>At the talk I welcomed people and then handed over to Daniel of the ADSC to introduce the speaker. I wasn't very impressed with the talk, just a few examples of collaborative robots and a few philosophical questions.</p>
        <p>The journey home was more difficult, since the A27 was closed.</p>
