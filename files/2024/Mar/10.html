        <h1>Sunday 10th March</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning (and a little of the afternoon/evening) preparing the video recording of last Tuesday's talk. I had problems with the start and end slides being cropped. It turned out to be a setting in Handbrake that caused the cropping. Angela, of course, went to church and I sorted out my tool bag from yesterday.</p>
        <p>It seems that the US have now brought their clocks forward. We spoke to Victoria and then, later, to Paul. They had had family visits due to Krista's birthday.</p>
