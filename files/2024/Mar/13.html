        <h1>Wednesday 13th March</h1>
        <p>I went off, in the Panda, just before ten, to Adversane to meet up with David F-B and the other members of the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee and biscuits we set off in David's Rover, mainly following some MGs on a circular route back to Adversane. We had about 60 people and there was a Rolls Royce group there as well. All the Rolls (and a few Bentleys) parked in the front and we all parked at the back!</p>
        <p>Lunch was good and I was home just after 2:30.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis during the afternoon and later I started 'playing' with the H-bridge chip that I bought. I started by checking that switching the two inputs between ground and 5 volts changed the direction of current on the two outputs.</p>
