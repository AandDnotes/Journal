        <h1>Thursday 21st March</h1>
        <p>Being weekly supermarket shop day we had a plan when we went out of the front door. We wanted to go into Worthing to Boots, M&amp;S and the seed &amp; nut shop (before having coffee in Waitrose)and then to Lyons Farm for the grocery shop. Although we did this, when we went into the garage we found that the 'tool' cupboard on the wall had fallen off! It had made a couple of dents in the Panda's bonnet and spilled a few things on the floor. We picked up the cupboard and put it on the bench. Then went off to shop.</p>
        <p>It was misty over the Downs and almost drizzling. We were home just before lunchtime. After lunch I uploaded the IET talk video to YouTube and then went out into garage to sort out the 'mess'. I emptied the cupboard and took it apart, putting the tools into some pots. A trip to the tip is planned.</p>
        <p>Before we went out I had a text message from SpaMedica to say that I had an appointment next week. They phoned to confirm it later in the day. Also, when the post came there was a letter for Angela from Worthing Hospital with a date in April for her ear operation.</p>
