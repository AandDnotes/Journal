        <h1>Friday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was right; it started raining at around midday. Angela went down to the High Street to change her dental appointment and buy a few things. Otherwise it was not a particularly productive day. But it was entertaining.</p>
        <p>We set off, in the light drizzle, to Findon just before midday. When we arrived at the Black Horse, most of the MG Club members on the 'pub run' were there. We had a good meal and a long chat with other members. We were home at about 2:30.</p>
        <p>I went in the garden to help Angela move one of the parts of the bird stand and decided to go into the garage and sort out one of the cardboard boxes, adding to the pile for the tip.</p>
