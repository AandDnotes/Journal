        <h1>Wednesday 20th March</h1>
        <p>I think the only time I stepped outside today was to open the back gate for the window cleaner. It was a gloriously sunny and calm afternoon and I had the patio door wide open, so I had to quickly shut it and the other windows.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day downloading and manipulating video files from yesterday's talk. By dinner time I had a completed recording, ready to be uploaded to YouTube.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went to table tennis, although this was her last session until the autumn. Next week she will return to going out with the walking group.</p>
