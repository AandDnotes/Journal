        <h1>Friday 8th March</h1>
        <p>Another sunny day, albeit with a bit of a cool breeze. We went off to Morrisons because they had condensed mushroom soup on their online shopping website. And they had it in store. We bought the rest of the lunch club food there also. Then we had coffee there and went around again to do our food shopping.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drove the TC to Storrington, to the painter. He said that the wings would need to be taken back to bare metal and that for the two bonnet top panels and the two front wings it would take two weeks and cost Â£1,300! At least the drive, 18 miles in total, was good.</p>
