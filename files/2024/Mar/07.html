        <h1>Thursday 7th March</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy and sunny day. I went off fairly early (9:15) to Rustington to the RCEA committee meeting as an 'observer', although I had to park in the general shopping car park. It was quite an interesting morning (including coffee and biscuits). I got home at 12:15. Meanwhile, Angela had been to the butchers.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the church to do some tidying in the garden and I started the TC. I ran it in and out of the garage until it was warm. I also had to clean off the 'mould' on the dashboard! Later I phoned the 'paint man' in Storrington, but had to leave a message.</p>
