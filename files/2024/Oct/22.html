        <h1>Tuesday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>Today was 'shoe day'. We went into Worthing with the intent of each buying a pair of shoes. Angela wanted boots and I wanted a replacement for my 'smart trainers' that I like for driving. It was sunny to start with, but by the time we got home it had beed raining for a while, which didn't help the washing that Angela had hung out to dry before we left.</p>
        <p>Having failed to find any suitable roadside parking within easy walking distance of the centre we went into the multi-story at the Gildbourne Centre. Then Angela found some boots at our first port of call,, the shop where she had bought her last pair of shoes. All their men's shoes had thick, stiff soles. I also tried Shoezone, Clarkes and Sports Direct, but no luck. However, Angela did find a top in M&amp;S.</p>
        <p>From there we went on to Next at Holmebush so that Angela could return a top that was too large. From there we went to Halfords at Shoreham. A warning light had come on and we diagnosed it as the rear numberplate bulb. I also bought some contact cleaner and chrome cleaner.</p>
        <p>Later I added more to the newsletter notes on my fusion talk.</p>
