        <h1>Saturday 12th October</h1>
        <p>We walked to the High Street, in the rain, to buy a newspaper and a few other things. Then I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. There were lots of people, but it was fairly quite on the electrical bench. I couldn't fix a foot massager because the PCB was cracked (by a button that had been pushed in hard), but I did reassemble a Nintendo controller that had been dropped and I soldered the battery wires on a set of kitchen scales. So two rings of the bell.</p>
        <p>Juniper had a softball match (which they won), so it was later in the evening before we spoke with Victoria. Brandon had a good trip to the research company in Canada and they were all (including Gene) cleaning and painting in preparation for if they have to put their house on the market.</p>
