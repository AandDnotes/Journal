        <h1>Monday 14th October</h1>
        <p>It was Lunch Club day and a rainy one at that. Angela went off early, but luckily it had stopped raining by the time that I walked down to the church. I spent time creating a start slide for tomorrow's talk and downloading the attendance list.</p>
        <p>We were home a little before four, but then it wasn't long before I went out again, this time to the Frankland Arms for the WSMGOC meeting.</p>
