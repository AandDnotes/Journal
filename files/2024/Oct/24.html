        <h1>Thursday 24th October</h1>
        <p>Supermarket shopping day. We started by going to Lidl at Lyons Farm and then over to Sainsbury's. I also took our new front door key back to Timpsons and they cut us a new one, since I had to put tape on the key to stop it going in too far. Then we went off to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee.</p>
        <p>It was sunny and calm for  most of the day, so after lunch Angela did some work in the garden and I went into the garage. I did a little experiment, rubbing down a patch of the offside front wing where their were 'pimples'. It seemed to improve it, so I did the pimply areas of both front wings. I started with emery paper, lubricated with water with a little washing up liquid in it. Then I used some T-cut, before applying some wax. The wings look better, although not as shiny.</p>
        <p>Later I looked at some UK-CC documents in preparation for tomorrow's meeting. I'm not sure they helped a lot!</p>
