        <h1>Sunday 27th October</h1>
        <p>After all the rain, it was sunny from morning to night. It was also calm. While Angela was at church I sent Greg H a sample start slide for the next talk. I also hammered the rivets on the wobbly handle of a saucepan and removed the broken 'wires' on a whisk.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning and some of the afternoon putting wax on the TC. I noticed that I've missed one area of 'pimples' on the offside front wing. Also, the front wings are dull compared to the rest of the paintwork (apart from the top of the bonnet). I might try polishing it with a cloth wheel or buy some very fine emery paper and try again.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul. Flo should get her 'cone' removed tomorrow.</p>
