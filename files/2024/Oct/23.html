        <h1>Wednesday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>Angela got quite wet this morning when out with her walking group. I, however, stayed indoors, completing my newsletter note on my fusion talk. I now just need to check it.</p>
        <p>The afternoon turned out to be sunny and calm, so Angela did some work in the garden and I went in the garage to clean the TC. I will let it dry before putting on some polish.</p>
