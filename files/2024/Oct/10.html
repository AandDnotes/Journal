        <h1>Thursday 10th October</h1>
        <p>After overnight rain and rain at various times during the morning it dried up during the afternoon and the sun even came out for a while. We went off a little later than usual to Lyons Farm to the weekly shop, firstly (and mainly) at Lidl, with a follow up at Sainsbury's. After filling the Panda with fuel we went on to Findon Vale garden centre for coffee. Angela also bought a few plants.</p>
        <p>I checked the dishwasher filter again, but could find nothing wrong. However, our current theory is that the waste (from the sink and dishwasher) is slightly blocked, so Angela put some soda down it. However, the dishwasher still gave the same error.</p>
        <p>I was also able to finish my notes on last Thursday's PEI meeting. I just need to check it before sending it out.</p>
