        <h1>Wednesday 30th October</h1>
        <p>A grey, but dry and calm day. While Angela went off with her walking group I corresponded with Greg H re the things for the next talk, printed our tickets for this evening's Steyning Greening talk and then walked to the health centre for a blood sample to be taken. I was early, but had only just sat down when the nurse called me in. So I was out before the time of my appointment. Later in the afternoon I had a message to tay that my records had been updated and found the blood test results there. Everything was 'in range'.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC to Beeding to get some petrol (the petrol station was full of Dudman lorries), doing my usual figure of eight circuit. Then I removed the Panda's rear, nearside wheel to look for any sign of what might be knocking. I couldn't see anything and couldn't move the suspension, although someone reported a similar thing on a Fiat forum and found that it was a rubber bush in the damper. So we might need to get Simms to look at it.</p>
        <p>After dinner we walked to the Steyning Centre to hear a talk on 'The State of the Adur' by Peter King. It was very interesting and very well attended. We were home by about 9:30.</p>
