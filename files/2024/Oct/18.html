        <h1>Friday 18th October</h1>
        <p>Still no sign of Angela's keys, but after some early mist it was a sunny day.</p>
        <p>I only really did two things today. I wrote up some more of my newsletter notes on my fusion talk and I went into the garage and checked over the TC. I had to tighten the bolts holding the float chambers to the carburettor bodies. It now needs a 'wipe over' since it is quite grubby after spending the summer at Milestone Classics.</p>
        <p>Apart from doing some washing, Angela went to the library and to buy some rolls for lunch.</p>
