        <h1>Saturday 26th October</h1>
        <p>We thought it would be dry today, but it rained all morning and stayed dull all day. Luckily it was calm. We started, under umbrellas, walking to the High Street to buy some rolls, some apples and a newspaper.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we went into Worthing, to the hospital. I had an appointment with neurology at 2:30. We were a bit early and I was called in at 2:15. The neurologist, who normally works at Brighton, did a whole lot of hammer, pin, tuning fork and touch tests and asked me to do various things, like stand on one leg and bend it at the knee. She also asked a lot of questions and thinks that the numbness in my feet and lower legs is Axonal Peripheral Neuropathy, meaning that the conductive centre of the nerves (in my case the longest ones in the body to the feet) degenerate with age. She does, however, want to check that it is not the out coating of the nerves that are damaged, so has referred me to Brighton. She also wants a blood test and to see me again in six months. The whole examination took 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. Austin was away camping and Juniper had gone out with a friend and her family. They are almost ready to put their house on the market, although Brandon has still not heard from anyone about a new job.</p>
