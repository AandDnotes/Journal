        <h1>Monday 28th October</h1>
        <p>There was no sign of the sun today. In fact it started raining just before lunch and continued for the rest of the day and evening.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to her Monday club, I went into the garage and tried using a cloth, polishing wheel on the TC's wing. It made no difference. However, later in the afternoon I had a call from Tony at Milestone Classics to say that they had received an enquiry. He wanted to know if I wanted them to pursue it. I said yes and he asked if Jamie could come over to take a 'full circle' video of the car with the engine running. We settled on Friday, which is forecast to be dry.</p>
        <p>I 'waisted' the rest of the morning completing the Rubrik's cube, following an online set of algorithms. It took a while to find where I was going wrong, but I finished it eventually. Later I mixed it up started trying to solve it without (too much) reference to the web site.</p>
