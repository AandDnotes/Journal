        <h1>Wednesday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her friends and I retrieved the audio and video files from the camera and microphones for last night's talk. As usual, I had to run the video files through Handbrake, reducing their resolution in the process. Later I built a start slide and a slide to go in place of the missing video. Then I put them all together, cutting out the audio during the time I changed the camera battery (exporting the files from the Rode app and then using Garage Band to cut out the clip) and spliced it into the recording. Finally I exported the recording and then ran it through Handbrake.</p>
