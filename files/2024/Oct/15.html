        <h1>Tuesday 15th October</h1>
        <p>Another busy and quite tiring day. Angela caught the bus to Storrington to bank the Lunch Club cash. I drove to Shoreham station and caught a train to Brighton (one earlier than I had planned) to join the RCEA visit to the National Rail Electrical Control Room. We had to be escorted across the track and the we split into two groups. Derek gave an overview of the history of rail electrification to one group and the other went up into the control room. Then we swapped over.</p>
        <p>We waited for a train to pass, crossed the line and I got on that train to get back to Shoreham. I got home a little after one to have dinner.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove to Falmer for the IET talk. I was the convener, but the talk from Mike U was not the best. Ramon took the video and went off with the SD card to produce the recording for YouTube. The (good) battery ran out during the questions. I brought back the camera/microphones, along with a cardboard banner that Ian Marshall brought along. He says that Mike W has pull-up banners and tablecloths.</p>
