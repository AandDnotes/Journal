        <h1>Monday 21st October</h1>
        <p>Another day without me going outside since it again rained on and off all day. However, this morning Angela went to her Monday group and also took some lunch club papers back to the church. I spent part of the morning opening a package that arrived from Caron. It included some IET branded items plus a number of items from Belfast/Northern Island, most of which were food. I ate a piece of cake (apparently called Northern Irish fifteen bun) with my lunch. Then Caron messaged the CC-UK members to say that the packages had been sent and asking us all to wait until the meeting on Friday before we opened them! So I admitted what I'd done.</p>
        <p>I also prepared the Adestra email for the next two talks. After lunch I checked it and submitted it for approval. The package from Caron also included a small Rubik's cube, so I've had a little play with it, but can't get further than fixing one side!</p>
