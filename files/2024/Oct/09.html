        <h1>Wednesday 9th October</h1>
        <p>Another quite busy day, and a dry one. Angela's Wednesday walk turned into walking around the streets of Steyning, delivering envelopes, before stopping for coffee. I drove to the Spur at Slindon to meet up with David F-B and the rest of the Sussex Wanderers. David was in his MGF.</p>
        <p>We had a good run, with the roof down. The curry was also good and I got home at about three o'clock.</p>
