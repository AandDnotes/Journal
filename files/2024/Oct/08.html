        <h1>Tuesday 8th October</h1>
        <p>I started by trying to find out how to pay retrospectively for my car parking at Burgess Hill station. It seems that, at that location, you can only pay on arrival! So. if fined, all I can do is appeal. While Angela went to the High Street to get a few things I cleaned the filters on the dishwasher and then tested the MacBook connected to the TV as a second screen in presenter mode. Then I went through my slides.</p>
        <p>After an early(ish) lunch I went to Field Place to give my talk on fusion. I was surprised that I completed it in 45 minutes. There was also a good set of question, even if a couple were on fission. Overall it was very well received.</p>
        <p>Then after dinner I attended an IET Sussex Network events meeting. It was a bit chaotic but Mike U seemed happy that we had enough talks fixed or with titles to see us well into the New Year. And I only picked up two easy actions.</p>
