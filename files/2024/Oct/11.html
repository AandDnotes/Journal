        <h1>Friday 11th October</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. I spent nearly all morning taking apart the waste pipes under the sink to see if a partial blockage was causing the dishwasher to think it was filling with water. Then, while trying to book an appointment for AEG to come and fix it, I discovered that all the kitchen appliances came with a service plan until August next year. So I phoned them and someone is coming next Wednesday.</p>
        <p>During the early afternoon we drove to Milestone Classics at Wisborough Green to collect the TC. It was sunny on the way there, but was cloudy on the way home. They had removed the side screens, so it was chilly on the way home. Also, the low-fuel light started flickering shortly after leaving. When we got home I found that the side screen socket was missing! So I had to wrap the 'pin' with insulation tape.</p>
        <p>In the early evening Angela went to a table tennis event at the Steyning Centre, even though she plans to give up playing.</p>
