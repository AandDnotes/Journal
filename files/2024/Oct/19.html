        <h1>Saturday 19th October</h1>
        <p>Angela was collected (in the rain) quite early and taken off to Eastbourne for the day. I made two trips to the High Street to buy a newspaper. The papers had not arrive (anywhere) when I got there the first time. Luckily the rain had stopped before the first walk and the sun was shining for the second.</p>
        <p>For me it was then the weekly accounts, followed by moving some money from our current account to a savings account. Then reading the paper and doing my Dutch lessons before Angela arrived home just before four o'clock.</p>
        <p>We then had a chat with Victoria. Juniper had been ill with a fever all week.</p>
