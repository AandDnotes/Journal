        <h1>Sunday 20th October</h1>
        <p>I didn't step outside today, mainly because it rained on and off all day, sometimes very heavily. Luckily Angela didn't get too wet on her walk to and from church.</p>
        <p>So I spent most of the morning (after a fairly late start) adding some more to my notes for the RCEA newsletter on my fusion talk. I also added an image to my slides and spent quite some time looking at a talk that I put together on process automation, trying to find out if I'd given the talk to the RCEA. I produced it originally to give to sixth formers, but expanded it and gave it to the RCEA in March 2017. It took a while to search for 'process automation' in github and then in my journal.</p>
        <p>Around four o'clock we spoke with Paul. Rowen said hello, but had a friend with her. We saw Flo with the cone around her head and also Kitsy, playing with everything.</p>
