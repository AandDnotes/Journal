        <h1>Friday 25th October</h1>
        <p>Neither of us went out of the house today, although that wasn't really to do with the rain. I was ready to join the CC-UK meeting at 9 o'clock, but it didn't start until ten. So then I spent the rest of the day, until four, sat in the study (apart from a tea break and lunch).</p>
