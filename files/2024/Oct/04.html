        <h1>Friday 4th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street and library, I generated the next Adestra email. It took most of the morning (although I didn't start until ten), but the registration server kept going down, so it wasn't until later that I could check my draft email. After checking, I submitted it for approval.</p>
        <p>I also phoned Tony at Milestones, but my call went straight through to his voice mail. But he didn't call me back, as requested. Since it was a dry, bright and calm day, Angela did two batches of washing.</p>
        <p>Mid afternoon we took a drive to Ashington, to the pharmacy, to have our Covid and flu jabs. We were back in time for a cup of tea. Over lunch and during the first part of the afternoon I also updated the iMac's OS. I did spend a little time on my 'fusion' slides, adding a few notes.</p>
