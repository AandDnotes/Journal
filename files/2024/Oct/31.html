        <h1>Thursday 31st October</h1>
        <p>Another calm, dull day, but supermarket shopping day. We started at Lidle and then bought about three things in Sainsbury's. We then went on to Findon Vale Garden Centre for coffee in their new cafe. Angela then spent some time looking at the boots, trying on several pairs. However, the only pair that fitted were similar to those she already has. So she didn't buy anything.</p>
        <p>Before we left we noticed a smell of petrol in the garage, so later I went out to investigate. After an outing yesterday of just my usual figure of eight, both carburettors are leaking a little petrol. I had intended fixing the hold-up bolt with thread-lock. However, if the washers are leaking then I didn't want to fix it in place. So I simply tightened the two bolts. I still haven't heard anything from Jamie, so I don't know if he is coming tomorrow to video the TC.</p>
