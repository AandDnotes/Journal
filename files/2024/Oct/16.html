        <h1>Wednesday 16th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early with her walking group. It seems that they arrived at the Hub quite early. My plan had been to go in the garage to look at the TC, but I didn't make it. I had several email to send, including writing up some notes about the SCADA systems being used at the Brighton ECR that we saw yesterday. So when Angela got home I was still inside.</p>
        <p>Since we were expecting a service man to call later in the day to fix the dishwasher, we had our main meal at lunchtime. Then there wasn't much time before I had to go to the health centre to see the physiotherapist. He couldn't suggest anything more, so has really eliminated a trapped nerve as the cause of my numb foot. So it is all now down to the neurology department at Worthing.</p>
        <p>We had been told by the dishwasher repair company that the man would come between four and seven. He phoned at around 4:30 and was here half an hour later. He concluded that the pressure sensor was blocked, which it seems is a common problem. So he replaced it and left the dishwasher on a test cycle. It turned itself off after about ten minutes.</p>
        <p>After tea, Angela went off to the church to help serve refreshments at a book talk/signing.</p>
