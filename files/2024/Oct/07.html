        <h1>Monday 7th October</h1>
        <p>It wasn't a good start to the day. I was due to catch the train from Shoreham to Victoria, but there was a crash at Shoreham flyover that caused all the local roads to be clogged. Although I had paid for parking at Shoreham, I drove to Burgess Hill, parked there and caught the train. Martin was very surprised to see me on the platform.</p>
        <p>After coffee, the 'London walkers' then took the tube to Waterloo and walked around Lambeth before crossing Hungerford Bridge to go into a cafe in Victoria gardens. Then we went back over Hungerford Bridge to continue our walk along the South Bank, over Waterloo Bridge and on to Temple. WE then actually walked back to Victoria, stopping at the usual pub for dinner. To our surprise it was dry and mainly sunny all day.</p>
        <p>Of course, I had to get off the train at Burgess Hill and then drive, mainly in the rain, home via lots of roundabouts. I got home just before nine, but couldn't find a way of paying for the parking! I will need to have a 'live chat' with them in the morning.</p>
