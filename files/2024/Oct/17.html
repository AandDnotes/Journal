        <h1>Thursday 17th October</h1>
        <p>A day of highs and lows. The weather was warm and bright and Angela started by walking to the butchers to by the week's meat. We then went off to Lyons Farm, initially to Lidle and then to Sainsbury's before going off to Holmebush so that Angela could look for some new jeans and a top. She was successful on both counts.</p>
        <p>The 'low' started as we arrived at Lidle. We realised that we needed a 'pound' coin for a trolley. Angela went to get one from the car, but could not find her keys. She assumed that she had left them at home after I 'hurried' her out of the house. However, when we got home we could not find them! We searched high and low. Angela had them when she came home from the butchers, but did not have them before we went into Lidl. So we drove back to Lyons Farm and asked in Lidl, B&Q, Curry's and Sainsbury's if any keys had been handed in. They had not. So we went to Timpsons and had a new set of keys cut.</p>
        <p>When we got home it was time to start preparing for the evening meal. Sandy and John came to dinner. It was a good evening.</p>
