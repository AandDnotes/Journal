        <h1>Sunday 6th October</h1>
        <p>This morning was about catching up from yesterday. While Angela was at church I edited and printed the route instructions for Wednesday's Wanderers run. Then I bought my rail tickets for tomorrow, along with my parking at Shoreham. I decided that it wasn't worth buying a senior rail card, since I would need to buy five tickets of this type before I started to gain.</p>
        <p>Then it was a case of finishing the update to the monthly accounts. This took the rest of the morning.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. Krista had gone away for the night with a friend from Wales and Rowan had returned today from a night away with Greet and Wim in a holiday cabin. Paul also sent us a stop-motion video that Rowan and her class-mates (three others I think) had made during an 'arts' day on Friday. They went to see a film (Billy Elliot) in the morning and used an iPad app to make the video in the afternoon. Rowan did the sound track.</p>
