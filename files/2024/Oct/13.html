        <h1>Sunday 13th October</h1>
        <p>The weather forecast was that today would essentially be the only dry day for the next week. It was also calm, if a bit on the cold side. So rather than do what I really wanted to do, which was check over the TC (there was a strong smell of petrol), I cleaned out the gutter before lunch. Angela was at church and then at a meeting. She was staying at the church for lunch (which apparently was quite cold; the church that is) so I had lunch alone and then painted the garden store, finishing a little before she got home.</p>
        <p>In fact, I had almost finished reconciling the bank state, which Angela found in the mail box this morning, against my weekly accounts. I found my one mistake and so made it balance. Then we spoke with Paul. Flow had been to the vet about a growth on her eye and is due to go back next week to have it removed.</p>
