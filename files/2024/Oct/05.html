        <h1>Saturday 5th October</h1>
        <p>After our walk to the High Street to get a newspaper, my intent had been to do both the weekly and monthly accounts. However, I started the day with a bit of a headache and then I welt slightly nauseas. So I did the weekly accounts and started the monthly accounts, but spent a lot of time just sitting. By the evening I was just feeling tired.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria, for a surprisingly short time, because they had a lot to do. Then I did start 'enlarging' the route instructions for Wednesday's Wanderers run, while Angela cut the grass. However, it took me longer than expected since the originator of the route notes had used spaces to make things line up!</p>
