        <h1>Tuesday 1st October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the butchers, I entered the synopsis for the talk on autonomous vehicles into Dave's spreadsheet and emailed the speaker about an image. He is happy with my choice. I also retrieved the attendance list from Plus4events for this evening's talk. The server went down for a while, but I got the list after lunch and put together the sheets.</p>
        <p>I logged into our Barclays account to check that the money for the jewels had been paid into our account by Whiblys.</p>
        <p>Later I drove to Crawley, in the rain. The Crawley College car park is a building site, so spaces were limited. And we had quite a few attendees. It is quite an impressive set-up, although the slides need to be sent to them early. The speaker arrived just before the scheduled start of the talk and, after Greg's introduction, launched straight into battery chemistry! She had about 60 slides and talked fast with a strong Chinese accent.</p>
        <p>My problem was that the camera battery died part way through. So I had to change the battery. Hopefully the audio is recorded on the Rode microphone that was attached to the speaker. Also, I need to send out my Adestra email earlier, so that Norman can see the spike in registration before he has to order the food.</p>
        <p>Luckily the rain had more or less stopped for the journey home.</p>
