        <h1>Tuesday 29th October</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went to the butchers in the sunshine, while I paid for the RCEA Christmas dinner and sent George W the completed form. We decided that we would go to Nymans Gardens for lunch and for a walk. By the time that we got there it was overcast, so any autumnal colours were not very bright. We had some lunch and then walked around the woodland, down to the lake, and then around the formal gardens.</p>
        <p>It stayed dry, but as we started the car to leave Nymans it warned that the one of the daylight running lights had failed. So later in the afternoon I replaced the bulb.</p>
