        <h1>Thursday 27th December</h1>
        <p>We were ready an hour before we were due to be collected by Russell, so we did some more of the jigsaw puzzle. This week the flight was on time. It was a reasonable flight that arrived at Oakland airport 35 minutes early. However, by the time that they finally delivered the luggage we were crossing the bridge to the station when we saw the train depart! So we went back to the BART station and caught the train to Richmond, where we could catch the next Capital Corridor train. We arrived at Davis just before eight o'clock.</p>
