        <h1>Tuesday 4th December</h1>
        <p>We had another rendezvous with the plumber at Rosemary Avenue this morning. He came to the conclusion that the plug connection to the solenoid valve was not making a good connection. He left it without a screw, which he thought was distorting it.</p>
        <p>We were home just in time to cook lunch and I topped up our cash card with US dollars, only to find later that the Pound had risen due to a series of government defeats! We were just about to start desert when Chris Rickard arrived to look at the TC's steering box. He thought that the job was simpler than he had thought. So he took away the box/column and oil seal. He will try to get it done before we go away for Christmas.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, Angela went to Tesco at Holmebush to buy things for the lunch club Christmas dinner, while I did some more clearing out in the study. Later I drove to Moulescoombe for the Brighton University awards ceremony. It was a well organised event and I got home at about 9:15.</p>
