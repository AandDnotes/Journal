        <h1>Monday 17th December</h1>
        <p>We arrived at Victoria Grand this morning early enough to get a cup of coffee. It would probably have been better not to have it! We didn't stay long since we wanted to go into Worthing to buy a case and we both had to go out early after lunch.</p>
        <p>We went into Waitrose to park (and bought three things) and then really only went to Beals. There we found a medium-sized, blue, 'hard' case for a pound less than the one we had seen on the Argos web site. It turned out to be the cheap range from Antler.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch Angela went to the WI Christmas meeting and I went to the dentist for a check-up. Luckily all was well. When I got home I went into the garage and fitted the steering column back into the car, including the rubber draft excluder. I then removed the top plate, wire brushed it and gave it a coat of black Hammerite. Hopefully on Wednesday I can fill the box with oil, re-fit the top plate, connect the drop arm and fit the steering wheel.</p>
