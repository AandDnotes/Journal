        <h1>Sunday 9th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the usual updates and backups and then continued sorting out things in the study. After lunch I was in the garage when Paul called. Just as I was about to go back into the garage so Victoria called. Juniper was about to go for her swimming lesson, but wanted to talk to us. But then she didn't talk!</p>
        <p>Eventually I got into the garage and finished wire brushing the steering column. I then gave it a spray coat of primer. Although it seems that some areas of the column have grease on them and so the primer is bubbling up. Meanwhile Angela prepared sprouts for tomorrow's lunch club and then made stuffing balls.</p>
