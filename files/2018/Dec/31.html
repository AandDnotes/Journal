        <h1>Monday 31st December</h1>
        <p>New Year's Eve, but really just a day like any other when visiting the Hurr family. Victoria was feeling a lot better today and she cooked a 'Christmas' lunch, although we ate it with the jigsaw in the middle of the table.</p>
        <p>After lunch (and a lot of washing up) we walked to the nearest supermarket to buy just a few items. It was another fine, sunny day, but much windier than previous days. We then finished the jigsaw, had a picnic style tea, bathed Austin and Juniper and then read them stories. We did stop for a while to watch some of the 'public' news programme, where they showed a little of New Year's fireworks from New Zealand to Paris.</p>
        <p>I added a blank set of journal files for 2019 to my repository and modified my reader to shoe 2019. At first I thought that it was not working since the iframe content would not change. Later I realised it was because I was running a local copy and the source of the iframe was not local.</p>
