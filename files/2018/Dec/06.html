        <h1>Thursday 6th December</h1>
        <p>Today was the usual visit to Dad and grocery shopping. However, we started with a trip to Storrington to deliver documents to the solicitor in connection with the sale of Rosemary Avenue. It was the first time that we had actually met Angela Payne.</p>
        <p>So by the time that Dad had tried on his second pair of trousers and we had made his Christmas card list we were quite late doing the shopping, particularly since we called into Majestic Wines to pick up a free bottle of prosecco (from Barclays).</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went down to Steyning and called into Rosemary Avenue to check the boiler and I did some more clearing out in the study, mainly of Dad's files.</p>
