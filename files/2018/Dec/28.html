        <h1>Friday 28th December</h1>
        <p>After a reasonable night's sleep we were up fairly early. After breakfast we wrapped Christmas presents so that everyone could open them. I helped Austin build one of his Meccano models and Juniper had a nap, having ben unwell during the night. After lunch I went with Brandon and Austin to the 'brewing' shop to buy malted barley and some other bits. We then played some games. As often seems to happen when we visit, they were very late to bed.</p>
