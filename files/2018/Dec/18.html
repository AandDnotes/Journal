        <h1>Tuesday 18th December</h1>
        <p>It was a relatively early start to Brighton University for the FIRST Lego League regional contest. My part was mainly after lunch. I was one of the robot games referees. It was a good day, but the teams were not very accomplished. I was home a little after four o'clock.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela was visited by our purchaser's mortgage surveyor and then caught the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash. On her return she took the key that the surveyor had borrowed, back into the estate agents and called into Rosemary Avenue. She also went to the library.</p>
