        <h1>Wednesday 12th December</h1>
        <p>Luckily the British Gas plumber arrived just after breakfast and replaced the fan. So by about 9:30 we had heat, although it took quite some time for the house to warm up. During this time Angela went to Rosemary Avenue to check that the heating was still on and then we started completing the solicitor's documents.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I gave the TC's steering box and column another coat of paint and finished reading the documents about the FIRST Lego League that takes place next Tuesday.</p>
