        <h1>Saturday 1st December</h1>
        <p>A pretty wet day. Angela went to Beeding to buy a newspaper dressed in her waterproof trousers. We then walked to Goring road to catch the 10:20 bus to Horsham. We couldn't see much due to the condensation on the windows, but it was a good journey. We bought a plate, bowl and mug for Juniper (our main reason for going to Horsham) plus a few other things. After lunch we caught the bas home and were in doors by a quarter to three.</p>
        <p>After a cup of tea we spoke with Paul and Rowan. Victoria was about to go out, so we will try speaking them tomorrow. Before dinner I managed to do the weekly accounts, including paying the money wanted by the solicitor, and, being the beginning of the month, started the monthly accounts.</p>
