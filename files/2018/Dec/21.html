        <h1>Friday 21st December</h1>
        <p>It was a day of sorting ourselves out, following a day of disappointment yesterday.We started by going to Victoria Grand. To our surprise Dad remembered that we should be visiting Victoria and not with him. From there we went on to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm to buy enough food for the next six days.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the butcher, to check on Rosemary Avenue and to tell the two estate agents that our plans to be away had changed. Meanwhile I changed the travel insurance dates and printed the new airline travel documents.</p>
