        <h1>Wednesday 26th December</h1>
        <p>We went for our Boxing Day walk after lunch, even though we only went to Rosemary Avenue to check that all was well. Even though we wouldn't have been able to do much if it wasn't.</p>
        <p>Otherwise we mainly did the jigsaw, reaching the stage where we only have the almost impossible pieces to put in place. Now we just have to pack before we go to bed.</p>
