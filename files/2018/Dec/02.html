        <h1>Sunday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>My normal, quiet, stay-at-home Sunday morning was disrupted today. Sally and her son Peter had arranged to call at Rosemary Avenue to collect the grandfather clock and some other bits and pieces. So while Angela went to church (she was organising the coffees today) I went, armed with screw divers, to meet them. It was another blustery, drizzely day. Unfortunately, the repaired boiler was not working. It was warm on Friday when Angela called in there, but today even repeated resets would not get it to light. Anyway, they came with a small van and took the things they wanted and I was home by about eleven o'clock.</p>
        <p>So I took another couple of photos of the steering box and completed an email to Chris Rickard about the work that needs doing. I'm still waiting to hear something from Roger Furneaux about paying for the bushes! Afterwards I completed the monthly accounts and later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria, resulting in slightly overcooked pork chops!</p>
