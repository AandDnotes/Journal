        <h1>Saturday 8th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela went down to the church kitchen to put the rolled turkey breasts in the oven, I waited for GuildCare to collect the piano. They arrived at ten, but there were only three of them and they had no trolley. So they will call when they can call again.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I walked down and waited until the turkey was cooked, when we came home for lunch. Afterwards we walked down again and I sliced the turkey using the electric slicer.</p>
        <p>When we got back we spoke to Victoria et al.</p>
