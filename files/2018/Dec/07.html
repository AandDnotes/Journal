        <h1>Friday 7th December</h1>
        <p>It was Angela who did things today. Firstly we sent off the instructions to proceed to the solicitor for Rosemary Avenue. Then she was down at the church this morning, preparing for Monday's lunch club. Then, after lunch she was off again to buy the vegetables needed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling against the statement, since the piano is being collected and I'll be helping Angela tomorrow. The rest of the time I spent clearing out files in the study.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went off to the Hill Barn Golf Club for the SRFC Christmas party. It was a good evening, with quite a lot of food, awards presentations and a raffle.</p>
