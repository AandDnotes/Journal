        <h1>Monday 10th December</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early to do the cooking for the lunch club. I then went to Victoria Grand and helped Dad write his Christmas cards, which took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried repainting parts of the steering column and then found that the boiler was not working. I removed the outer cover and found that the fan was not working, which is the first thing that should happen. So British Gas are coming (again) tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Later I went to the WSMGOC Christmas meeting at West Chiltington.</p>
