        <h1>Saturday 29th December</h1>
        <p>Brandon's friend Ed called this morning and they made a batch of beer. They have quite a lot of quite expensive equipment. Meanwhile Victoria, Angela and the children walked to the nearest supermarket to do some grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>After a lunch of beef burgers we took Austin and Juniper to the nearest park while V&amp;B went to another supermarket to get the rest of their groceries. In between these activities we played with the children. As usual, they both became much more energetic as bedtime approached!</p>
