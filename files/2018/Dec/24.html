        <h1>Monday 24th December</h1>
        <p>We started with a trip to the tip in Broadwater, hoping to leave with them the diesel/petrol that I had removed from the TC's tank. However, they would only take it if it was in a container. So we brought it home. We did, however, dispose of some material.</p>
        <p>From there we went to Waitrose to buy milk and bread (plus a few sprouts) and to have coffee before going to Victoria Grand. We were pleasantly surprised to find Dad in the conservatory taking part in some games.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went around to Rosemary Avenue and I tried starting the TC. I could get it to run for a while with the choke out and the accelerator pressed, but it would not keep going. So I put the battery back on charge and will try to flush it through with petrol in the New Year.</p>
