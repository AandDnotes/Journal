        <h1>Sunday 16th December</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I spent most of the morning reading and reviewing documents for the Gift Oversight Group.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Paul and I reassembled the steering column of the TC. On the Bishop Cam steering box there is an end plate, that holds the cam and the inner column in place, and a top plate that hold the sector shaft in place. The top plate had been replaced with a Tomkins Kit, placing a roller bearing on top of the sector shaft rather than just the surface of the top plate. However, Eric Worpe warns of this placing too much stress on the sector shaft arm, which can break off! So I decided to replace the original top plate.</p>
        <p>Both the top plate and end plate use shims for adjustment. However, they each have a different purpose. The shims under the end plate  allow the plate to pinch the ball bearings at either end of the cam, whereas the shims under the top plate adjust the end float on the sector shaft. The end plate shims had clearly been home-made. You can buy shims of 3, 5 and 10 thou in thickness. The 'home-made' shims were a total of 67 thou, one of 60 thou and one of 7 thou! However, there was no gasket. With a new gasket in place I removed the 7 thou shim so as to get the cam to turn smoothly, hopefully without too much end float. The original top plate came with three shims. I didn't measure them, but two were thinner than the third. With a gasket, I removed one of the thinner shims, which seems to minimise the sector shaft end float.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon Angela went to a carol concert at the Methodist church. She was later home than expected, so we had a late dinner.</p>
