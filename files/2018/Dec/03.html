        <h1>Monday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>This morning, before we left home, I phoned the plumber about the boiler in Rosemary Avenue. Then we visited Dad at Victoria Grand via Storrington. We delivered the completed sale and purchase forms to the solicitor and then drove into Worthing. Luckily the trousers that we had bought Dad fitted and so we then went into Worthing and bought him another pair.</p>
        <p>Yesterday evening I had an email from Roger Furneaux. He increased the price for the bushes from £15 to £20 and said how difficult it was to install them in the steering box. So after lunch I refitted the old bushes (which are steel with a bronze lining) and told Roger that I will wait until I've spoken with the person who will be doing the work. I also had a reply from Chris and spoke to him to arrange for him to call to look at what needs to be done.</p>
