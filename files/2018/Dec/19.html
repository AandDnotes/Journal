        <h1>Wednesday 19th December</h1>
        <p>Today was essentially for packing. However, we walked round to Rosemary Avenue to read the water meter and check the heating. All was well. When we got home we started putting things out for packing so that after lunch we could fill the cases. Between our two medium-sized cases we seem to have plenty of room.</p>
        <p>A little later I went into the garage, filled the steering box with oil, bolted on the top plate (with shims and gasket), reconnected the drop arm and put the wheel on. I used a length of wood to ensure that the wheels were pointing forward. I had to re-assemble the steering wheel before putting it on the column. Having cleaned the splines with a needle file, the hub slid easily on to the column. But the pinch bolt would not tighten enough to hold the hub on the splines of the column. My 'cleaning' of the splines must have been too vigorous. So I wrapped some PTFE tape around the splines at the top and where the pinch bolt is at the bottom. It seemed to work.</p>
        <p>It was raining by the time I had finished and I need to open the door in order to lower the car to the ground. So I put the cover over the car and will leave it until the New Year.</p>
