        <h1>Tuesday 25th December</h1>
        <p>Christmas Day, a day on our own, apart from Facetime calls with firstly Rowan and then Austin and Juniper. Rowan had already opened her present, while Austin and Juniper opened the parcels in their stockings. They are leaving the rest until Friday when, hopefully, we will be there.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church this morning and I started drafting the IET January newsletter. I finished it after lunch and sent it to Bernard for review. We also spent some time working on the jigsaw and watching TV.</p>
