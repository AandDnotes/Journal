        <h1>Sunday 30th December</h1>
        <p>There was frost on the roof-tops this morning, although the sky was blue. Victoria was not feeling well and spent a good part of the day in bed. This morning I failed to make any headway with one of Austin's video games, but after lunch we went for a 'hike' to a couple of playgrounds. Juniper was 'reluctant' to come home without being carried! They were both very late going to bed.</p>
