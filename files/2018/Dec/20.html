        <h1>Thursday 20th December</h1>
        <p>Not the day we had expected. At least we are not where we expected to be. We heard on the radio this morning that Gatwick airport was closed due to one or more drones being flown oer the runway. The Norwegian website and the Gatwick departures 'board' showed our flight was still scheduled. So Russell took us and we joined the queue.</p>
        <p>We arrived at 10:30, but it was not until one o'clock that they cancelled the flight, saying that we could change our booking online. We tried while we were at the airport, but the web site would not let us select the Sunday flight. However, we found that we could use the train for free. So we caught the service to Shoreham, where we had lunch in Truffles before getting a taxi home.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to Steyning to buy some milk while I rebooked our flights. Norwegian only fly to Oakland on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. The Sunday flight was full, Tuesday is Christmas Day and, although the flight is scheduled, the train to Davis does not run that day. So we booked seats on Thursday (a week late), with a return on the 8th, about ten days later. We now need to buy some food to take us over the Christmas period since we had eaten up everything.</p>
        <p>It seems that there have been about 50 drone sightings so far and this evening the airport is still closed.</p>
