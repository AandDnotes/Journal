        <h1>Tuesday 11th December</h1>
        <p>A cold start to the morning, but the British Gas plumber arrived quite early. However, he really only confirmed that the fan had failed. He had to order one and someone will come tomorrow morning to fit it. So the day continued to be cold.</p>
        <p>Then Angela went to Steyning and I reconciled the latest bank statement against my spreadsheet. I also watched a video of a TC being taken on a 10,000 Km run around central and eastern Australia, spoke to a surveyor about doing a survey on Penlands Vale and ordered gaskets for the steering box.</p>
        <p>After lunch I painted the steering box and column. I had planned to use a spray can, but I could not get it to spray (it is very old) and so brush painted it with black Hammerite. It will need a second coat tomorrow and then some 'touch-up' of areas obscured by the masking.</p>
        <p>We had our main meal at lunch time since I went to an IET talk in Crawley. It was on fuel cells and was very good.</p>
