        <h1>Sunday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>A day trying to recover from the stupidity of yesterday. Angela went to church while I updated the accounts and paid Russell for the journey to Gatwick. Then I went into the garage. I marked up a thinner dip-stick, made up my syphoning tube and syphoned about three gallons out of the tank into the jerry can. Then I removed the fuel line from the carburetter and pumped out about a litre into a plastic box. This should be enough to replace diesel in the line with petrol that hopefully was floating on top of the diesel. The fuel pumped out easily, so I decided that the filters were not blocked. I also removed and cleaned the plugs, which were a little sooty and damp and convinced myself that the float chambers did not contain much liquid since the pump had to work for a while to fill them.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried raising the steering column as much as it would go and then tried starting the car. It would not start. There were a few firings, but the battery ran down. So I put it on charge and will try again tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We then spoke with Paul et al. We will try to speak with them again on Tuesday. They will also be on their own, since Greet and Wim are not going there until Boxing Day.</p>
