        <h1>Friday 14th December</h1>
        <p>I spent the day travelling by train to Warrington, attending John Taylor's funeral and returning home. John Tyler and Chris Kent met me at Warrington station and we went to the chapel at the cemetery. There were about one hundred people there, mainly John's colleagues. Maurice and Barbara Wynne were also present. After the secular service we went to a hotel for chat and some food. Angela took me to Shoreham station to catch the 8:15 train to Victoria, which took 1 1/4 hours. Then I took the Victoria line tube to Euston and caught the Virgin train to Warrington, which was the first stop on the way to Glasgow. It only took 1 3/4 hours. The train from Warrington was late by half an hour, but I caught the expected train from Victoria and Angela met me at Shoreham at about 8:40.</p>
