        <h1>Thursday 13th December</h1>
        <p>Angela finished the solicitor's forms for Rosemary close before we went to Storrington to deliver them. Then on to Victoria Grand to see Dad. We left Â£20 with Jullie for their Christmas fund.</p>
        <p>So by the time that we got to Sainsbury's it was midday. We started with coffee and didn't have too much to buy, so we were not too late home. Amongst the mail was a letter from John Tyler, giving details of JB's funeral. Which is tomorrow! So after lunch I booked train tickets to get to Warrington and back. I need to catch the 8:15 from Shoreham and should arrive back there at 9:30pm.</p>
        <p>After a late-ish lunch Angela went to Steyning to get some books to read over Christmas and take some things to a charity shop. I finished painting the steering box, touching up the bits that were covered by the masking tape. Then I put the Panda in the garage since it is going to be cold tonight.</p>
