        <h1>Wednesday 5th December</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela was down in Steyning, I replaced the battery in the Macbook Air. All went well, except that I 'lost' one of the tiny screws that holds the bottom of the device in place. I had carefully placed each screw on the folded dust sheet, next to the hole, but I must have knocked one off the sheet. In spite of a good search I couldn't find it. So for the moment the Macbook Air is short of one screw. However, the system now says that the battery is in a 'normal' condition. We just need to see if it lasts longer.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday Angela went to table tennis after lunch. It was their 'competition', but she didn't win! Meanwhile I wrote my Christmas cards and emailed Julie and Dave about the January newsletter, as well as doing more clearing out.</p>
        <p>After an early (and quick) dinner we walked down to Steyning for the Steyning Christmas 'late night'. Luckily the rain stopped and there were a lot of people in the High Street and lots of stalls. There was even a fun fair in the car park with quite large rides. We called in to Osbourne Humphries for a glass of wine and then went into Truffles for a coffee. We were home before nine o'clock.</p>
