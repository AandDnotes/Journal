        <h1>Saturday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>A day of gross stupidity. It started well enough. a mainly sunny and dry day. We walked to Beeding to buy a paper and spent the rest of the morning reading it. After lunch, while Angela did some sorting out, I took the MG off the axle stands and checked oil, water and tyres before taking it for a test drive. That's when the stupidity kicked in. The steering seemed fine, but I'd decided to get a little petrol so that there was plenty for the Boxing Day run. I drove into the Beeding service station. The first pump only had unleaded and diesel, so I went on to the next pump which had a Supreme+ sign. So I put nine litres in the tank, along with some additive. Then I noticed that the fuel was Supreme+ diesel! I decided to drive home before the diesel worked its way through to the engine, which started spluttering as I turned into Maudlin Lane and I had to restart it. Then again in the road outside and on the drive, but I got it in the garage.</p>
        <p>It seems that diesel is denser than petrol, so when it has had a chance to settle and separate I will siphon the diesel from the bottom of the tank (there was about 25 litres in the tank before I put in the diesel), use the pump to push the diesel out of the fuel line, clean the filters and the plugs and hope that it will start. Then refill it with petrol.</p>
        <p>Following this stupidity we spoke with Victoria et al. Austin had been unwell on Thursday evening (and sick throughout the night) so had not been to school on Friday. He slept well and they were all late up, but he was feeling a little better. We'll try talking to them on Tuesday.</p>
