        <h1>Wednesday 12th July</h1>
        <p>Angela left the house first this morning, to meet up with her WI walking group. I left shortly after in the TC and drove to Billy's on the Road, just north of Billingshurst. After coffee about 50 people, in a selection of MGs, set off for a 25 mile drive, partly through the Surrey countryside, to a pub at Alfold Bars, on the B2133 just beyond Loxwood. It was well organised and I had a good run home, arriving at about three after a total of 63 miles. I then put the TC in the middle of the garage, ready to start work on the distributor. After an early dinner we picked up Dad and went to Chichester Theatre to see Fiddler on the Roof. It was very good and quite long (Dad thought the end of act one was the end). We got Dad home at about 11:30 and we were home by half past.</p>
