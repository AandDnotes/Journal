        <h1>Thursday 12th July</h1>
        <p>We set off early this morning to go to the Post Office sorting office in Small Dole to collect a return of a probate form. We then went off to Victoria Grand before going on to Sainsbury's. We started early because we were expecting the delivery of a new washing machine some time after midday. In fact, it arrived at about 1:30 and was quickly installed after the old one had been removed. We did a 'cleaning wash' and then a real wash, after which we found water on the floor. I pulled the machine out, but the water was only at the front. So we did another wash and there was no leak. Angela had earlier walked to Steyning to take the contract to Hamilton Graham and to check on Rosemary Avenue. I also added a 'time' arrow to the family tree diagram.</p>
