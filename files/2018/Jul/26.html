        <h1>Wednesday 26th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking, in the rain, with her WI group, I spent nearly all morning replying to responses to my Adestra email. However, of the ten responses we currently only have two more volunteers. However, some who don't have current DBS certificates might be able to help if they are 'supervised'. After lunch I removed the windscreen wiper from the TC and stripped it down. Before taking the gearbox apart I connected it to the dashboard socket to test that it runs. However, it looks as though it needs new brushes.</p>
