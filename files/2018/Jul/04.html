        <h1>Wednesday 4th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI friends this morning and I got to Victoria Grand in time to clip Dad's fingernails before taking him to the opticians in Lancing. We were a couple of minutes late, but he was back at Victoria Grand by about 11:45, in plenty of time for lunch. I came home and took the MG to the Swallows Return pub at the end of Titnore Lane to have lunch with Mark, Malek and Simon. John Dolan was also there for a while. I got home by about 3;30, in time for a cup of tea. Angela wrote a couple of letters to try to release some of Bay's accounts.</p>
