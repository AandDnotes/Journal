        <h1>Tuesday 4th July</h1>
        <p>We started the morning by taking Sam to the vet for her annual checkup and innoculation. She was very good, although has lost a little weight. We need to take her back to be weighed in about six weeks. After lunch I ordered new bushes, thrust washer and gear pin from the Distributor Doctor. However, I'm still unsure how easy it will be to remove the old bushes and fit the new. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden, cutting back the ivy. I then joined her and pruned mainly ivy that was growing over from the wood. Later I sent the photos and car information to the organiser of the Scout/Guide event at Ardingly.</p>
