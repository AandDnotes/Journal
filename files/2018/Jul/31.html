        <h1>Tuesday 31st July</h1>
        <p>We started by taking some bags of things to the charity shop and whilst in Steyning I had my hair cut. I responded to Greg's draft 'invite' and after lunch, while Angela was working in the garden, I cleared out the gutters and then pruned a piece off the willow tree. After a snack we went to Chichester theatre to see 'Me and My Girl' with Caroline Quentin and Mat Lucas. Enjoyable, but perhaps not quite as good as some of the other musicals we have seen there.</p>
