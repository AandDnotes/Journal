        <h1>Thursday 13th July</h1>
        <p>Shopping day. We were off fairly early after a late night. In fact Dad was still eating his breakfast when we got there. Although we started with the usual M&S food shopping, I then bought a jumper and a belt in their sale and we just did the rest of Dad's food shopping in Tesco. After taking him home we went to Sainsbury's to do the rest of the food shopping, since Angela had a good discount coupon. After a late lunch Angela took Philip his shopping while I filed down a washer in the hope that I will be able to get it behind the bushes in the distributor and pull the bush out using a bolt, nut and socket. Later we took Bay to the optician in Steyning. I left them there and came home to wait for the delivery of the equipment needed for the next two wearable technology workshops. Then I went back down to collect them and take Bay home.</p>
