        <h1>Friday 13th July</h1>
        <p>We seemed to spend a lot of time on busses today. We started by taking some rubbish to the tip in Shoreham and then parking at the recreation ground and catching the 700 bus to Worthing. Angela paid in some cheques at RBS and paid some bills before we bought Austin and Juniper some wellies. After coffee and buying a little food in Waitrose we caught the bus back to Shoreham. When we got home we found a lot of mail, including several more cheques to pay in! So after lunch we did the journey again. This time we just went to the bank before bying an ice cream and catch the bas back. When we got home I updated the spreadsheet to reflect the actual amounts received and what has gone in and out of the executors account.</p>
