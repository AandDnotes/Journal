        <h1>Saturday 15th July</h1>
        <p>We had our usual Saturday walk to the newsagents before Angela prepared a salad and I removed teh distributor from the TC. We then drove to Lyminster, to the WSMGOC barbeque, held in a member's garden. It was a very large and quite spectacular garden and, luckily, it kept dry. When we got home Angela worked in the front garden and I dismantled the distributor. Unfortunately my home-made tool for removing the bushes was not up to the job. So I reassembled the distributor (putting on the new thrust washer since there was not one beforehand) and re-installed it. I will connect it up and set the timing tomorrow. I will also see if I can adapt my tool before I decide to cut the old bushes.</p>
