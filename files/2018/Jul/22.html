        <h1>Sunday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I tried to fix the leak on the washing machine waste and posted some photos of our time in Dorset. I then took the TC to Steyning to pick her up and go to Lyminster for the WSMGOC barbecue. It was a good, well attended event and we were back home by about 4:30. Shortly afterwards we spoke with Victoria et al.</p>
