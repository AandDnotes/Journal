        <h1>Saturday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>Today was the Lyminster Fete and I had agreed to take the TC along. There was a shower just before we were due to leave and so we kept the hood up, firstly going to Beeding to get some petrol and driving the 18 miles to Lyminster. We were there before eleven, but there was still an hour before the start. We coralled the classic cars and had coffee and muffins (not very good ones, provided by Fran). In addition to half a dozen MGs there were also three Austins there, two 7s and a larger vehicle, plus a Jaguar, a VW and another German model. It was a good, well supported fete, with lots of variety. However, just after one it started to rain and continued until three, when we left; although we were not the first classic car to leave. We were home about 3:30 and I dried off the car as much as I could. It was the wettest that it's been.</p>
