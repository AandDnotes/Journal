        <h1>Tuesday 10th July</h1>
        <p>Since it sounds as though the bearing has gone in our washing machine, we took a basket of washing to Rosemary Avenue. While there we sorted out some things. Also, Angus and an assistant called to check the layout details. We then took clothes and shoes to the St Barnabas charity shop. Later in the afternoon Angela hosted a WI committee meeting while I 'played' with some more of the family tree pages.</p>
