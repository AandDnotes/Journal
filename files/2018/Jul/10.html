        <h1>Monday 10th July</h1>
        <p>Angela was cooking at lunch club this morning. Meanwhile I went to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes, put on some washing and fill his pill box. After lunch I read the documents for tomorrow's GOG meeting and then took the TC out to get some petrol. After tea I drove it to the WSMGOC meeting at Worthing Rugby Club. The discussion was about the future of the club. Then I drove home in the dark.</p>
