        <h1>Saturday 28th July</h1>
        <p>We started with a quick trip to Steyning before going to Rosemary Avenue. There I rebuilt the base of the table, leaving it tied up while the glue dries, while Angela emptied the furniture that is going to auction. We brought most of the things back with us and spent the afternoon sorting them out, mainly for taking to the tip. I also did the weekly accounts and trimmed some of the growth coming over the fence from the wood.</p>
