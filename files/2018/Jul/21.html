        <h1>Friday 21st July</h1>
        <p>Just before Angela set off for Steyning I went off in the car to Hove. I went to the Nut & Bolt Shop to get a stud, nuts and washers to make version 2 of my bush extraction tool. I parked right outside the shop, but it took me a slong to work out how to use the parking machine as I took buying the pieces! Anywhay, I was home before 10:30, so I cut a large stem out of the fig tree and removed branches from under the big conifer. We had an early lunch since Angela was going to Knepp Castle for a 'wildlife walk'. While she was out I sent feedback to STEM Sussex on the wearable technology workshop, checked to see if my Adestra email problem had been resolved (it hadn't) and made my new bush extraction tool. Then I trimmed the bush beyond the laurel.</p>
