        <h1>Sunday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>After a walk to the Beeding newsagents and while Angela went to church, I removed the distributor from the TC and managed to remove the old bushes. I did not use my extraction tool in quite the way I had imagined, but I got them out. So I left the new bushes soaking in oil and after lunch put them in the freezer. I did a little research on the wiper motor, since it was smoking (or perhaps steaming) on Saturday. After talking to Victoria (they were all up early) and then to Paul, I managed to insert the new bushes. I had to use a wooden block and a hammer, but they went in without too much difficulty. However, the shaft will not now fit through the bushes! I tried cleaning them out using emery paper, but I measured the shaft as 0.490" and the hole in the bushes as 0.487". I did not expect the insertion to deform the bushes and may now need to ream them out.</p>
