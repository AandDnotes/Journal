        <h1>Monday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>A busy day. I started by going to Davison School to help with a Wearable Technology workshop It didn't finish until one o'clock and so I did not get home for lunch until just after two. Meanwhile Angela had been helping people at the church. After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. We also tried to 'tame' the hydranger by his side gate. When we got home I measured the play in the distributor bushes. I need to replace the two bushes and the thrust washer! Later I replied to those on the mg-tabc group who had sent me comments.</p>
