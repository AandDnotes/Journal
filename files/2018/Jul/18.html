        <h1>Tuesday 18th July</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day and I had a quiet one. This morning she caught the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash and this afternoon went to Fittleworth to a WI concert (with strawberries and cream). This morning I made a target for the guide/scout event. I then spent the afternoon sending details of our budget to the IET committee and trying to set up an Adestra email, but I couldn't find a way to create a link to an email or message. I then ironed four pairs of trousers!</p>
