        <h1>Wednesday 18th July</h1>
        <p>We had a sunny day out in Weymouth, which was a short drive westward. Weymouth has a long sandy beach, so after walking around the town (and buying a bucket and spade) we had a pleasant lunch in a restuarant by the old harbour and then spent the rest of the time sitting on the beach.</p>
