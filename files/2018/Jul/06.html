        <h1>Thursday 6th July</h1>
        <p>We were up fairly early since the tree man was due at about 8:30. I checked the train departures from Shoreham and found that they were all on time. So there is hope for tomorrow. Shortly after the tree man arrived we went to Dad's to find him just getting up! We waited for him to have his breakfast and then went to Holmebush. Neverthelest we were home a little earlier than usual, to find the tree man clearing up. After lunch Angela took the shopping to Philip and Bay. I started by walking to Beeding (it was quite hot) to have my hair cut. Then I re-programmed the ESC in the clider to enable the brake. I then tried various ways of stopping the motor from a switch, but nothing worked. Various posts suggested that it could be done, but then came to the conclusion that it could not. So I will replace the throttle cut button with a toggle switch.</p>
