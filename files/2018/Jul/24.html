        <h1>Monday 24th July</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going down to Steyning. Then we went over to Dad's to 'turn over' his bed, put on some washing and fill his pill box. We also cut down some of the hydrangea by his front gate. After lunch I walked to the health centre to see a physiotherapist about my leg. He thinks it was just a torn muscle and has given me some exercises. When I got back I took my distributor body and shaft to Simon's, where we reamed the bushes to accept the shaft. When trying to reassemble the distributor I discovered that the lower bush is not quite pushed in far enough, since the gear wheel will not quite go on the shaft far enough for the pin holes to line up.
