        <h1>Tuesday 24th July</h1>
        <p>This morning I went to the Sussex University engineering awards ceremony. Hamish presented our single prize. It was very hot. However, I was home just before midday. The others had gone to visit Dad and walked along the promenade. After lunch in the garden, Paul et al went off to Horsham to meet some friends while we whiled away the time. I did, however, prepare for tomorrow's meeting, including looking at the IET Sussex budget.</p>
