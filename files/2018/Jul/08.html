        <h1>Saturday 8th July</h1>
        <p>Since Angela had to go to Holmebush to buy food for the lunch club, she also bought a newspaper, therefore removing the need for me to walk to Beeding. So I did the weekly accounts and replaced the throttle cut button the the RC transmitter with a toggle switch. So it is now possible to stop the motor by flicking a switch. I also reviewed the IET programme entries and sent comments to Hamish. Then I emailed Daniel at STEM Sussex about the guide/scout camp, only to find that he is on holiday until Thursday! so I forwarded it to their general address. After an early dinner we went to the Music Society concert at the Steyning Centre. It was a Spanish quintet, playing mainly Spanish traditional songs.</p>
