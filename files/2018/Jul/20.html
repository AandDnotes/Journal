        <h1>Thursday 20th July</h1>
        <p>Shopping took place this morning as usual. John phoned just before we left Dad's and then we met John and Laura in M&S as we were heading for Tesco. We were home just before one to find a parcel for Paul and a copy of TCs Forever More from the Octagon Club, even though I hadn't actually ordered one (just put my name on an interested list). However, I was pleased to receive it at that price. So after lunch I spent some time glancing through it before I 'hacked' at the fig tree while Angela took Philip his shopping. Then I finished 'wiping down' the TC and applied a little wax.</p>
