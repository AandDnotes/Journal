        <h1>Friday 20th July</h1>
        <p>A long, busy, hot and tiring day. We drove to Lulworth Cove, but started by walking half a mile uphill (very steep) and half a mile downhill to Durdle Door. We didn't walk down to the beach, but an ice lolly refreshed us before we made the return journey. The half mile uphill was not quite so steep. We had a pizza lunch in Lulworth Cove before going down to the beach. When we got back to the cabin we went for a swim, had tea and went fossil hunting again.</p>
