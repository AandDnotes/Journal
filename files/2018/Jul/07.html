        <h1>Saturday 7th July</h1>
        <p>After a late breakfast we all set off for Parham House, where they also had a 'garden weekend'. It was very hot, but we went around the waled garden, had lunch in their cafe and then went around the house. We follwed that with an ice cream, sat in the shade of a tree, before heading home. After dinner we walked down to the Steyning Centre for a Music Society concert - medieval music and ballards.</p>
