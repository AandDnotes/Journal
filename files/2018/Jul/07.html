        <h1>Friday 7th July</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela drove me to Shoreham station where I caught the train to London and then walked to Savoy Place. After lunch I walked to the Royal Academy of Engineering, just off The Mall, for the HUBSEE steering group meeting. I stayed there a while afterwards to read some GOG documents and then walked back to Victoria, where I had a baguette before catching the train home. We were back by nine o'clock. The HUBSEE meeting was more productive than the first. I also met the vice chair of the IMechE, who is keen for more collaboration.</p>
