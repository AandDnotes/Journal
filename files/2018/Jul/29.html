        <h1>Sunday 29th July</h1>
        <p>It rained for most of the day, so I stayed inside, although Angela got wet on her way home from church, even though she took the car. I did the usual updates and backups and then checked Greg's IET Sussex budget spreadsheet. I also sought out photos for a blog post about Sussex technology and posted it. Later in the afternoon we spoke briefly to Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
