        <h1>Wednesday 19th July</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going walking with her WI friends while I moved my Adestra email forward a little and spent time reading the paper. After lunch we sat until afternoon tea time! Then I started 'cleaning' the MG while Angela prepared her WI gift-aid claim. It took some time to get the date format right. After dinner (we had a quick fish & chips meal because we were late) Bay gave Angela her shopping list and said that her TV had stopped working. So I went round, pushed in the arial connections, and it all worked.</p>
