        <h1>Saturday 14th July</h1>
        <p>We started with another trip to the Post Office sorting office at Small Dole to collect a letter. It was just an M&G letter returning a probate form. We then called into Steyning to buy a newspaper, some meat from the butcher and some bread and milk. Most of the rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and reconciling the accounts with the statement. Angela worked in the garden and I checked the plugs on the TC. They were still black, but didn't seem quite as bad, so I made the carburetters one flat leaner. I then 'wiped' the bodywork and applied some wax. After dinner we fitted the drip-feed in the greenhouse to see if it will keep the tomato plants watered.</p>
