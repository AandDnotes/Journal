        <h1>Friday 14th July</h1>
        <p>It was an early start this morning to get to Brighton Aldridge Community Academy by 8:10 for the 'Wearable Technology' workshop. In fact I was there at ten to eight, although the STEM deliverer didn't get there untill half past. It was more chaotic than the last workshop, but the children did some good work, even if more time was spent on the T-shirt than on the electronics. So I was home by 12:30. After lunch we drove into Worthing for a collection of oddments. I found some cheap wire strippers in Bunce and we stopped at Halfords on the way home to buy a car washing brush.</p>
