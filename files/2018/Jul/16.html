        <h1>Sunday 16th July</h1>
        <p>After my usual walk to Beeding I finished re-installing the distributor in the TC while Angela was at church. Luckily the engine started and I was able to set the timing. I used Norman's method of finding the point of maximum revs and then advancing the timing to reduce the revs by about 50 rpm. I then also reduced the idle speed back down to 1,000 rpm. At this speed, the strobe showed an advance of 15 degrees (at least on cylinder 1. After lunch I took the car out on my usual figure of eight test run. All seemed well. I left the car in the middle of the garage so that I can give it a bit of a clean before Saturday's fete. By this time the headache with my cold was quite bad, so I simply sat in the chair for a while before we spoke with Victoria et al. Paul and Krista were at Ikea! So we spoke to them after dinner. Rowan was staying with Greet overnight.</p>
