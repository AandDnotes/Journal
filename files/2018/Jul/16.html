        <h1>Monday 16th July</h1>
        <p>We were away by 9:30, heading for Dorset. First stop was Hinton Ampner (NT) for coffee and a look around the house. We then moved on to Mottisfont (NT) for lunch, but we didn't have time to look in the house. Then we headed for Ossmington Mills, between Weymouth and Lulworth Cove, arriving at the holiday park at around a quarter to four. Paul, Krista and Rowan had arrive a little earlier. So we started with a little exploration of the 'fossil' beach, before having a pasta supper.</p>
