        <h1>Wednesday 5th July</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went walking with her WI friends. They went to Slindon. Meanwhile, I  received the documents for Friday's HUBSEE meeting. So I printed them and looked up the train times, all of which had changed since I bought my tickets! Even then the driver's overtime ban may cause some of the trains to be cancelled. I also got the python radio code to work on two micro:bits. While doing this I charged the battery for the glider. After lunch I took the glider up to the flying site to meet Gordon. The plan was to try flying the club's glider (with buddy box), but Gordon had left one of the wings at home! So we modified the controls on my glider, borrowed a 3S battery and Gordon flew it. I need to get another battery and try to get the throttle cut to work via a switch.</p>
