        <h1>Thursday 5th July</h1>
        <p>I had told Dad that we would not visit him today since I'd seen him yesterday. So we went directly into Worthing, to the Nationwide and then to RBS, to deliver requests to close Bay's accounts and move the monies into Angela's 'executors' account. After coffee we went to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop, which was a little larger than usual due to our visitors this weekend and starting to buy groceries to take to Dorset. So we were home for a late lunch. Afterwards I vacuumed out the Panda and then checked (cleaned and adjusted) the spark plugs in the TC. As a result of what I found I made the mixture two flats leaner. I then replied to Colin Forsyth's agreement to talk to the IET before helping Angela with more account closure and share transfer requests and vacuuming the sitting room and hall.</p>
