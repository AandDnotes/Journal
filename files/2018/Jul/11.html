        <h1>Tuesday 11th July</h1>
        <p>I started the morning by taking the Energy Watch equipment to Brighton. However, it took half an hour to get from the Hollingbury road down to the University. So I went straight to Mithras House for th Gift Oversight Group meeting. Stephen Duderidge was obviously in a hurry, so we finished within the hour. I then returned the equipment and was home by midday. After lunch Angela went a WI committee meeting and I checked the TC's oil, water and tyres, prior to tomorrow's run. The rest of the afternoon was then spent trying to progress the Linux Time Machine server, but without much progress. I can get the iMac to connect via Samba, but can't make Time Machine see the drive.</p>
