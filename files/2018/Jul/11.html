        <h1>Wednes 11th July</h1>
        <p>Angela set off first this morning, to go walking with her WI friends. I then left in the TC to meet the Sussex Wanderers at the Red Lion pub in Ashington, only five and a half miles away. There was a good selection of MGs, including a 1931 14/40 (and an Austin 7 and a Jowett). We set off to Maplehurst, although the road we wanted was closed by BT! So we took our own diversion. At the White Horse in Maplehurst we had a barbeque, sat in a large gazebo. By the time I got home at about 3:30 I had done 45 miles. We spent the rest of the afternoon recovering. After tea I removed the waste bin from under the sink in preparation for a new washing machine tomorrow afternoon.</p>
