        <h1>Thursday 27th July</h1>
        <p>We started our weekly shopping trip a little earlier than usual and, in spite of a larger than usual shop, we were home relatively early. After lunch I sent a few more emails about the guide/scout camp and then went into the garage to continue reassembling the TC's wiper motor. This took me the rest of the afternoon and I finished refitting it after dinner.</p>
