        <h1>Friday 27th July</h1>
        <p>Paul et al finished their packing and we all left the house at about 9:15, them heading towards Dover and Angela taking me to Shoreham station. I cought the very crowded 9:43 to Victoria and then the tube along to Embankment and Savoy Place. There I dealt with email and read the minutes of the last HUBSEE Steering Group meeting, before having lunch and then going back to Embankment station. This time I took the Northern line to Euston. Just across the road was the Meeting House, where we had the meeting. It was more productive than the others. In fact they are gradually getting better. Afterwards I caught the tube back to Savoy Place and bought a sandwich. However, the Faraday Louge closed at six today, so I went back to Victoria (starting off in a thunder storm) and ate my sandwich on one of their benches, before getting the train to Shoreham, where Angela met me.</p>
