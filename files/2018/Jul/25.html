        <h1>Wednesday 25th July</h1>
        <p>Angela was the first to leave the house this morning. She went off to meet up with her WI walking friends and walk around Bramber Castle. Paul et al then left (to spend the day with friends) just as Bernard was arriving. A few minutes later Greg arrived and we spent the morning discussing details of the proposed 'business event'. After Bernard left, Greg and I went through the Sussex Network budget for next year. Angela arrived home just before we finished. After lunch we walked round to Rosemary Avenue and tried to dismantle the dining table so that it could be removed from the room. After spending a very hot time removing eight wood screws, to no avail, we discovered that the cross that forms the base would knock off. So we then moved both parts into the hall and put the hall table in the dining room. Later we will reassemble the parts so that the company collecting it for auction can get the two parts out of the front door and then put them together. After an early dinner we went to the Bramber parish council meeting to (along with about 100 others) to hear the proposal to include Clays Field in the neighbourhood plan as a possible development site. As one might imagine, most people were anti from the start and didn't seem to believe that it was a proposal for inclusion and discussion rather than a fully formulated plan.
