        <h1>Tuesday 25th July</h1>
        <p>I spent the morning in the garage, reassembling the distributor and installing it. I pulled both bushes into the distributor body by a few thou each so that the hole in the shaft and the gear lined up and there was the minimum of end float without restricting rotation. After installing the distributor I adjusted the timing by finding the maximum revs and then retarding by 50rpm. I then took the car for my usual test route. It seems to be running very well. Afterwards I cut the grass, front and rear. Meanwhile, Angela went to the dentist, shredded some of the prunings pile and applied feed to the back grass. I also finally managed to launch my Adestra email and recieved six replies.
