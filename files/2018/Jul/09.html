        <h1>Sunday 9th July</h1>
        <p>While Angela took Philip to church I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. During the morning I updated my glider web page and forwarded my mail to the general STEM address, only to find that Sarah seems to be on holiday as well. Later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul and then to Victoria.</p>
