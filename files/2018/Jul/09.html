        <h1>Monday 9th July</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the health centre this morning to get new hearing aids. She also asked Angus to put Rosemary Avenue on the market. Meanwhile I went to visit Dad. Angela took the keys to Hamilton Graham after an early lunch and after an early dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting. I paid for the barbeque and for the South Downs Run.</p>
