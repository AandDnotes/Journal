        <h1>Monday 17th July</h1>
        <p>Just before eleven I went to Steyning Grammar for the wearble technology workshop. I had to start the workshop on my own, since Noelle and Tongei had gone to the upper school! We had to find our own lunch and then, at teh end, pack up quickly. However, we left the heat web rolls behind. Afterwards I went to Dad's to fill his pill box, change his bed and put his washing on. I also looked at his sink waste, which is not draining properly. Angela was at a WI meeting this afternoon and, after dinner while she was counting her money, I went to the WSMGOC committee meeting at Adversane.</p>
