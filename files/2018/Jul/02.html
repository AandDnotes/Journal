        <h1>Sunday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>Yet another unproductive day. Angela took Philip to church and I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. I then updated the computers, backed up changed files and had a short look at the micro:bit radio code. I also posted a query about ignition timing on the MG-tabc forum. Following one reply I again measured the 'diameter' of the TC's distributor shaft. Another reply pointed me to a technical note about dismantling the distributor. Then we spoke to Paul et al and, after dinner, to Victoria et al.</p>
