        <h1>Monday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>Another hot day. After hanging out washing I went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad while Angela did some housework. When I got back I checked on flights to Oakland. around Christmas. It seems that BA are suspending their flights in August, but Norwegian are still flying. Later we went Victoria suggested dates. With information from Krista a bout the holiday lodge we located it on Google maps and on the holiday park's web site. We also took eight large bags of clothes from Rosemary Avenue to two charity shops in the High Street.</p>
