        <h1>Sunday 1st July</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I tackled more of the 'topknot' on the yew bush, cutting a piece off the main trunk, plus a few other branches. The next phase should emove it completely. But it got too hot, so I cleared up and came indoors. In addition to an IET related email I did the weekly accounts and later, the monthley accounts. After lunch we went down to the 'give your stuff away day' at the Catholic church to see if we could find a car seat. Unfortunately not. We also spoke to Paul and Victoria.</p>
