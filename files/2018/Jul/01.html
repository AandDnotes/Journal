        <h1>Saturday 1st July</h1>
        <p>Another busy day getting not very far. We both walked to the the Beeding newsagents and then spent a while reading the papers. Angela then did shredding in the garden while I did the weekly and monthly accounts. After lunch Angela went to help serve cream teas at the church and I 'played' with two mico:bits. I tried making them communicate via 'radio'. This worked with the Java Blocks language, but I   spent a long time trying to get the Python code to run and, even when it did, I couldn't get them to communicate.</p>
