        <h1>Friday 13th April</h1>
        <p>I started by submitting the April newsletter for approval and then mailed the three people interested in helping with the SLO role. Although I was planning to put the TC on axle stands, I decided that it was too cold. So I did some jigsaw! After an early lunch I drove Angela to Worthing hospital for her pre-assessment. I went on to visit Dad, who has a urine infection and has been prescribed antibiotics. Then I went back to the hospital to find Angela before we went off to Sainsbury's to do a little food shopping. When we got home, Angela continued checking the IHT forms, finding lots of errors!</p>
