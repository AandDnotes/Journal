        <h1>Thursday 26th April</h1>
        <p>Quite a momentous day really. When we got back from Berriedale Drive this afternoon there was a phone message and an email from the solicitor to say that contracts had been exchanged and completion was on Monday! We had collected various things that Alan thought he could sell to raise a little more money for Dad. This morning Angela went to Holmebush while I took teh TC off the axle stands. Later I contacted Southern Water and HomeServe to cancel the service and filled in forms for the change of address for Barclays and Santander.</p>
