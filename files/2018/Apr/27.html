        <h1>Friday 27th April</h1>
        <p>We started by going to Berriedale to pick up the final things, note the meter readings and vacuum around. We then went on to visit Dad (who had contracts and invoices for Victoria Grand) and then went into Worthing to change his address at Barclays (successful) and Santander (made appointment) and set up post redirection at the Post Office. When we got home there were emails from the solicitor and the agent. I closed his energy and house insurance accounts and TV license. I also sent the solicitor bank details for the balance transfer. Then I did the weekly accounts while Angela started checking her 2016/17 interest payments.</p>
