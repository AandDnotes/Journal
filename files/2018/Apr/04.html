        <h1>Wednesday 4th April</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to the Hygienist and to Rosemary Avenue, I replied to a number of emails and finished my latest article for Main Gear before sending it off. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I went to Berriedale to meet someone from St Barnabas about house clearance. I then went on to SETYRES at Lancing Green to get a puncture repaired. After dinner we walked down to the Steyning Centre to see 'Murder on the Orient Express'.</p>
