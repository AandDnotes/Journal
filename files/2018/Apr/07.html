        <h1>Saturday 7th April</h1>
        <p>We were not up particularly early, but we walked to Beeding to buy a paper, examining the new community orchard on the way back. The rest of the morning was spent reading the paper and doing the weekly accounts. The postman brought Toovey's valuation document just before lunch. So after lunch I worked through the IHT 'attached' forms and started completing the main form.</p>
