        <h1>Wednesday 18th April</h1>
        <p>A very busy day that started with us going with Krista to take Rowan to school. Krista then dropped us at the Krimpen aan den Ijssel jetty where we cought the waterbus into Rotterdam. There we picked up the coach that took us to Keukenhof. At The Hague they ran out of seats on the coach! So, eventually, two people went by taxi. We had a good day walking around the gardens befor getting a (slightly larger) coach back to Speido in in Rotterdam. The air conditioning was not working, so it was very hot. We had a good meal nearby before catching the waterbus back to krimpen and being picked up by Paul.</p>
