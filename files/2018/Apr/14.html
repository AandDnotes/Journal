        <h1>Saturday 14th April</h1>
        <p>I phoned Berriedale early this morning and Alan answered. They had travelled down yesterday evening.  So we went to Rosemary Avenue to turn off the heating and then on to Berriedale. Alan had already finished clearing the bottom shed, so we finished loading his van and took the rubish to the Broadwater tip. We finally left at about 1:15, Chris nd Alan going on to visit Dad and us coming home for a late lunch. Afterwards, Angela worked in the garden and I cut the front and rear grass before moving the TC into the middle of the garage, ready for putting it on axle stands. I then did the weekly accounts and printed some documents for our trip to Rotterdam next week. Alan phoned in the evening to say that Dad was very well when they saw him.</p>
