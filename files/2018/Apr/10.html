        <h1>Tuesday 10th April</h1>
        <p>We started by driving to Shoreham and catching the bus to Worthing. We bought some things for the grandchildren before calling to RBS about payment of bills. We then had lunch before walking along the promenade and catching the bus back to Shoreham. I paid the Toovey's bill and updated the IET slides before going to Crawley to meet with Gregg to discuss action re the business events and then attend the Ricardo talk on connected vehicles.</p>
