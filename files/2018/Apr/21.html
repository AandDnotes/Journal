        <h1>Saturday 21st April</h1>
        <p>Krista went off fairly early to do the supermarket shopping. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden and I made a new handle for the tool that Angela put in the bonfire. Then I cleaned and greased the strimmer before cutting the grass along the drive. We had a barbeque for lunch and then went to Greet and Wim's for a snack tea.</p>
