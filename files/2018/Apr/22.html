        <h1>Sunday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>Another stay-at-home day. We mainly sat around until Paul, Krista and Rowan went off for lunch at a party for her cousin's birthday. We made our own lunch and played with Flo. When they got back we bailed out the boat and pulled it up on to the grass to dry out. Later we spoke with Victoria et al.</p>
