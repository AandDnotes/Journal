        <h1>Sunday 1st April</h1>
        <p>April fools day and Easter Sunday! I spent a lot of the day working out Angela's 2016/17 tax and doing the monthly accounts. We seem to think that Angela had more interest than the HMRC think. Which means that we think she should be paying more tax! Angela went to church in the morning and later we spoke to Paul and then Victoria.</p>
