        <h1>Thursday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Angela's birthday. We had a slightly later start on what turned out to be a very hot and sunny day. We helped in the garden and I cycled to Rowan's school with Paul to collect her at lunch time and then again to collect her in the evening. Angela helped Krista to clear an area beyond the barns and I dismantled the fram around the sand pit. Later we all went to Lekkerkerk for dinner. We sat outside and had a good three-course meal.</p>
