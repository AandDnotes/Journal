        <h1>Sunday 15th April</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to church, I put the TC up on axle stands and removed the weels in preparation for cleaning. I also removed the rear brake drums to check for oil, after my work on the back axle, and to check the state of the new brake linings. All seemed well. I also retrieved the cases and started collecting things we need to take to Rotterdam. During the afternoon I composed another page of the family history series and we spoke to Paul (before lunch since they were going out) and to Victoria. Austin showed us his new (second hand) bike.</p>
