        <h1>Tuesday 3rd April</h1>
        <p>This morning a fitter from Siemens installed new electricity and gas meters, so called 'smart' ones. While he was doing this I read Dad's notes on his family and life while Angela went to Steyning and worked in the garden. After lunch I typed up one of his notes on to a web page and integrated it into the family tree site.</p>
