        <h1>Tuesday 17th April</h1>
        <p>An early start with a drive to Ebbsfleet. We were an hour early, but the train was on time. We were at Brussels before the Thalys train was allocated a platform, but we only had to wait 15 minutes. We arrived in Rotterdam on time and called Krista. They (Krista dn Rowan) arrived at Capelsebrug just as we got off the Metro train. We left home at 8:12 and arrived at Akterbrouke ein at about 4:30 (local time). Paul got back from work just in time for dinner, which we ate outside.</p>
