        <h1>Wednesday 11th April</h1>
        <p>I started by taking the TC off to West Chiltington to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee and cake we drove off to Surrey! I followed a couple in a Lotus Elise (his TC engine is still in bits) down the wet and muddy lanes, ending up in Cranleigh. We had quite a wait for our meals, but I got home at 3:30 after 65 miles in all. After doing a little on this month's newsletter we walked down to Beeding Village Hall for a Bramber neighbourhood plan meeting.</p>
