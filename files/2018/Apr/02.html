        <h1>Monday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>Easter Monday. Not that it makes a lot of difference to us. We started by dropping in on Berriedale Drive before visiting Dad. We took him some Summer trousers and a short coat. On our way home we stopped at Waitrose for coffee and to buy some bread rolls for lunch. After a slightly late lunch Angela shreded paper and I downloaded movie clips and photos that Victoria and Paul had posted. I thn loaded them on to the iPad so that I can show them to Dad. I also updated my web page on the TC's rear axle, including my new drawing of the hum/axle general arrangement.</p>
