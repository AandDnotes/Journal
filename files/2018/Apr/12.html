        <h1>Thursday 12th April</h1>
        <p>Since Angela needs to go to Worthing hospital tomorrow afternoon, we decided to leave the shopping (and visit to Dad) until tomorrow. So this morning I completed the IET April newsletter and got it sent to Bernard for editorial review. After lunch I printed the IHT forms for checking and generated a long overdue web page for our visit to Berkenwoude in April 2017, reorganising the 'trips' pages on the server in the process.</p>
