        <h1>Friday 20th April</h1>
        <p>I started today by calling St Barnabas to see when they could clear Berriedale Drive; not until 23rd May. So I emailed the solicitor. Later in the day I phoned Emmaus to cancel their visit. Before lunch we went to Rowan's 'sports day' and watched the fun. Then later in the afternoon we went to watch her swimming lesson. It was another beutifully warm day.</p>
