        <h1>Tuesday 24th April</h1>
        <p>Angela was up early and showered before breakfast. She then went to Steyning while I showered and loaded photos on to the iPad. Then we went to visit Dad, via Berriedale. That was follwed by coffee in Worthing, visits to HSBC, TKmax (to buy a purse, a handbag and a pair of sunglasses) and Sainsbury's, before a very late lunch. Afterwards, Angela went to Rosemary Avenue and to the library, while I spoke with the solicitor and emailed the estate agent. Beforehand I phoned St Barnabas to see if they could bring forward the house clearance. But they couldn't.</p>
