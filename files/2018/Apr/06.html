        <h1>Friday 6th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning and to the church this morning while I contacted Sussex Chamber of Commerce and arranged a meeting to talk about a joint business event. I also cancelled Dad's British Gas Service contract, along with the direct debit (and those of council tax and BT), and ordered an oil filter for the TC. After seeing some font problems yesterday on the family tree pages on the iPad, I made changes to the CSS file since my preferred font does not show on IOS. Angela went to Tesco to shop for lunch club, taking some things to the church.</p>
