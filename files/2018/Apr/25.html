        <h1>Wednesday 25th April</h1>
        <p>Angela went walking this morning with her WI friends. They walked to Washington and caught the bus back. Meanwhile I spent most of the day in the garage cleaning the TC. We also heard from Dad's estate agent to see if there was a way to complete earlier than proposed. Eventually they said that the buyer was happy to take possesion with all the contents! So now we wait to hear from our solicitor. I put the wheels back on the TC, so that it is ready to take off the stands.</p>
