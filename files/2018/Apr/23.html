        <h1>Monday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>We were up reasonably early so that, after breakfast, Angela could go with Krista to take Rowan to school. We then packed and krista took us to Capelsebrug so that we could take the Metro inot Rotterdam. We met Paul outside his office. I thought he might show us where he worked, but we went back to the station to buy some lunch (for eating on the train) and then discovered that the Amsterdam to Paris Thalys train was delayed. Paul went back to work and we waited for the train, which was about half an hour late. So we, and a lot of other people, missed our Eurostar connection in Brussels. Unfortunately, the next train did not stop at Ebbsfleet, so we had to wait two hours in Brussels; coffee, walking around the station shops and sitting, before we could go into the Eurostar lounge. The journey was then fine and we got home just after 8 o'clock.</p>
