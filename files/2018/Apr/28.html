        <h1>Saturday 28th April</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We started by taking the TC to Lurgashall, north of Petworth, where we met up with other WSMGOC members for a treasure hunt, followed by lunch. It was cold, but a good event. When we got back (after a slight wrong turn and a total of 54 miles) Brandon was waiting for us. After dinner I managed to host a web page on GitHub.</p>
