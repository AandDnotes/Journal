        <h1>Thursday 5th April</h1>
        <p>Angela had an early appointment (well, 8:45) at the cricket club and so we left to visit Dad and 9:45. We showed Dad some photos and videos and then went to Waitrose for coffee and shopping. After lunch Angela worked in the garden while I went to Beeding for a haircut. When I got back I washed the car.</p>
