        <h1>Monday 30th April</h1>
        <p>Another busy day. I took some manuals to Berriedale Drive and then took the keys to the agent in Lancing before going on to visit Dad. By the time that I got home the solicitor had called to say that the money had been paid and would be in our account by four o'clock. We then went for lunch at the new Italian restaurant in Steyning, courtesy of Syngenta. I left Angela and Brandon in the restaurant and I went to Burgess Hill to meet people from the Sussex Chamber of Commerce and talk about our proposed IET business event. This looks promising. I was home by four o'clock and tried to change Dad's address with his pension providers.</p>
