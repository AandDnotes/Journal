        <h1>Monday 12th November</h1>
        <p>We visited Dad at Victoria Grand this morning after Angela had taken cleaned tea towels to the church. We then went on to Morrisons for coffee and to buy a few things.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was back into the garage to put wax on the underside of the front wings, running boards and inside the rear wheel arches. I then put the wheels on and removed the axle stands. Hopefully I can take the car for a run tomorrow and get some petrol.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting in West Chiltington. The rain was torrential at times, both on the way and when returning. Chris Rickard said that he might be able to do the work on the steering box.</p>
