        <h1>Thursday 29th November</h1>
        <p>It was supposed to be a straight forward visit Dad and do the groceries shopping day. However, the boiler was not working this morning, so only one of us had a shower and we phoned British Gas. It was a slight surprise to find that we had a Â£60 excess (essentially a call-out fee). So someone should call tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>Consequently we were a little later than usual getting to Victoria Grand. Then we found that the new trousers that we bought for Dad were too large around the waist. So instead of going straight to Sainsbury's we went into Worthing. Of course, we then found other things to do in Worthing, so it was 12;30 before we got to Sainsbury's and two o'clock before we got home!</p>
        <p>Documents from the solicitor concerning our sale and purchase were waiting when we got home. After a very late lunch we started cutting back the ivy clad branches in the wood that had been brought down by the wind and were laying on the fence. We had to stop because it was getting dark.</p>
