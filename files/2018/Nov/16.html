        <h1>Friday 16th November</h1>
        <p>The day didn't quite turn out as we had expected. There were two viewings booked for this morning. So we went off to Holmebush to look at Christmas jumpers. After we'd had coffee (in the foyer because the queues in M&amp;S were long)I bought one and Angela bought some pants before we went off to Sainsbury's in Hove. Angela found a jumper there and we bought a fee groceries. However, just before we were going to the checkout Angela realised that one of her hearing aids was missing. She assumed that it had fallen out when she removed her reading glasses. So we backtracked around the store and then went back to Holmebush where we had looked at jumpers in Tesco and then went into M&amp;S. No luck.</p>
        <p>We were late home and Angela's hearing aid was on the chest of draws in the bedroom!</p>
        <p>We had also missed a call from Ben at the estate agents. One of the couples that viewed our house this morning had made an offer, but of only £600,000. However, they do not need (or intend) to sell their house. After a little thought we said that £625,000 was the lowest we were prepared to go. So now we need to wait and see what happens.</p>
        <p>I then spent a lot of time looking at energy prices. First Direct want to increase our tariff by 37%! The person to whom I spoke said I should wait until the middle of next month, when cheaper tariffs will be available.</p>
