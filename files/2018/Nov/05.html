        <h1>Monday 5th November</h1>
        <p>Paul set off for work while we were eating breakfast. Then Krista took Rowan to School before taking us to Capelsebrug Metro station. We went to Rotterdam Centraal and caught the train to Schiphol. I had already checked in and the bag drop queue was quite short. However, the security queue was long, but moved quite quickly. We had lunch (even though Angela not feeling too well) and then caught the flight to Gatwick. The plane landed at three o'clock and by four we had got home and driven round to Rosemary Avenue to check it. The heating does not seem to be coming on.</p>
        <p>After an 'easy' dinner I emailed David Griffiths about the next Sussex Wanderers run, even though the weather forecast for the 14th is not too good.</p>
