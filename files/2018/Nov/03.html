        <h1>Saturday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>My ankle kept me awake for a while last night and Rowan woke us this morning! However, my ankle was less swollen and, although not right, has not been too much of a handicap today. By the time that we got down (after a shower) Greet and Wim were here. We started with coffee and biscuits, then they went to work in the second stall of the stables and I re-attached the tube for the bolt on the paddock gate. I drilled out the existing screw holes to take two bolts and a longer screw. However, it is a bit wonky!</p>
        <p>After a late lunch we mainly played with Rowan and then spoke with Victoria, Austin (who was still in bed when we called) and Juniper. Juniper had been unwell, but they were both tired after a couple of very late nights (even later than usual). Later Rowan helped Angela with her Dutch lessons.</p>
