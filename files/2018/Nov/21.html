        <h1>Wednesday 21st November</h1>
        <p>The viewing for tomorrow was cancelled, but the people who have questions about the drains/extention want to come back and talk with us and the people who have made an offer, being a little upset that the agent is still promoting it, want to view the house again. So both are coming tomorrow afternoon, with Ben hosting the second couple.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday Angela went to table tennis and I removed the two bushes from the steering box and decided that the existing sector shaft, even with its ground area, will be fine and not suffer from the risk of breaking. Then I went to Falmer for an IET/IMechE talk on 'Mobility as a Service and Autonomous and Connected Vehicles'. It was well attended and very interesting.</p>
