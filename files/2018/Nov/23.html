        <h1>Friday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>Dad had an appointment with Dr Ali at the Dermatology department in Southlands hospital this morning. So we started by going to Victoria Grand, where we found that he was still in his slippers, wearing a shirt with a button missing on one cuff and trousers that would not do up around the waist! After changing his shirt, but leaving his trousers closed by a belt, we dropped Angela off in Worthing and we headed East. We were early and so was Dr Ali. He froze a few spots on Dad's arms, but we were done before the due time of his appointment. Just one more visit in six months time.</p>
        <p>After coffee in Costa I took him back to Victoria Grand just in time for his lunch. I then parked in Worthing and walked to meet Angela in Debenhams, where we had lunch. When we got home Angela walked to Steyning and I de-greased the steering box and cleaned up the column. Later I started writing the December newsletter.</p>
