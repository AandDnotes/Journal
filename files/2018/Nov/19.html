        <h1>Monday 19th November</h1>
        <p>A good day that got off to a shaky start. Being Dad's 95th birthday we had arranged to be at Victoria Grand at about 10:30, along with Alan and Chris and John and Laura. However, the local traffic reports were full of the closure of the A27 between the Shoreham flyover and Manor roundabout, due to a collision, and the virtual gridlock of Worthing! So we decided to go down the A24 and straight down to West Worthing. It took us 45 minutes, but the traffic was not too bad. Alan and Chris had breakfast just outside Arundel and were at Victoria Grand at about 10:45. John and Laura didn't make it.</p>
        <p>We set ourselves up in the small lounge with tea/coffee and the cake that we had taken with us. Dad's next-room neighbour, Connie, joined us. We left at midday when it was their lunch time.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI AGM, fearing that they might need to disband due to a lack of committee members. However, they managed to survive. Meanwhile I went into the garage. I had removed the bolt on the steering wheel hub, but the wheel wouldnâ€™t pull off the shaft. So I undid the four bolts that hold the wheel hub together and removed the wheel from the lower part of the hub. The shaft and hub are splined, so used a hub puller to get the hub to within an inch of the end of the shaft, using an aluminium drift until it would not go further into the tapered centre of the hub. Then I hammered a screwdriver blade into the slot in the hub and gently tapped the hub off the shaft.  The splines in the hub have some damage that I will try to repair with a needle file. I then snipped cable ties (holding various cables in place) and removed the bolt through clamp under the dashboard. I pulled the clamp, spring and cap off the column. The spring seems to have been upside down! Then I removed column from the car.
