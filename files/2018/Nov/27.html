        <h1>Tuesday 27th November</h1>
        <p>Angela started the day by walking to the butchers in Steyning. We then set off to Shoreham to catch the 700 to Brighton. We went to find a toy shop that might sell Meccano Junior. However, no one seemed to stock the range. The odd traditional Meccano set, but not the Junior. However, we also went into the Apple store and trading in our iPad for a new one. They seemed to think that our old device was in excellent condition. I had backed up the old device and so I could restore the backup to the new one when we got home.</p>
        <p>It was raining when we arrived in Brighton. We had lunch and then caught the 700 back to Shoreham. It was wet and gloomy and I spent a while setting up the iPad so that Angela could do her Dutch lesson.</p>
