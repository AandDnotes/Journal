        <h1>Friday 30th November</h1>
        <p>I spent the whole day at home, in the morning waiting coldly for the British Gas man to arrive (he came just before one o'clock) and in the afternoon filling in the solicitor's forms. I spoke to her this morning to ask some questions and spent some time searching for documents.</p>
        <p>Luckily there was nothing seriously wrong with the boiler. He cleaned the pilot light and oiled the fan and all was well. And it cost us Â£60!</p>
        <p>Angela walked to Steyning and to Rosemary Avenue before lunch and was out again during the afternoon. Just after lunch she had a call from Sally, who is in London, about collecting Grandfather (clock) on Sunday morning. Between us we also did a little more sorting out of things and I ordered a new battery for the MacBook Air.</p>
