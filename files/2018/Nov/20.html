        <h1>Tuesday 20th November</h1>
        <p>A cold, grey day with occasional drizzle. Angela went off to Storrington on the bus to pay in her WI cash while I stripped down the TC's steering column/box and tried to get the AirPort working, without a lot of success.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove to Shoreham to get a lift from Bernard (in his Nissan Leaf) to Crawley for an IET Sussex Network committee meeting.</p>
