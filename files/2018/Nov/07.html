        <h1>Wednesday 7th November</h1>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent completing the monthly accounts and transferring/checking money. We ate our main meal at lunchtime since I was expecting sandwiches at the evening's IET meeting.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while Angela went to table tennis, I applied a second coat of paint to underneath the near side of the TC. Then it was time to go to Crawley, firstly for our Sussex Network AGM and then for a talk on airborne radar during the second world war.</p>
