        <h1>Friday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>The noise of the rain on the tin roof woke me a couple of times during the night, but we got up just before Krista took Rowan to school this morning. After breakfast we took Flo for a walk 'around the block', which took about an hour. Angela then went with Krista to collect Rowan from school. It is a half day on Fridays. After lunch we went down the garden to see the ponies and Rowan rode Freda. Freda also pushed against the gate and broke off the tube holding the bolt. I screwed it back on, but she broke it again, so the gate remained tied up. We then took Rowan for her swimming lesson. After dinner we played a couple of games. During the evening my right ankle became very stiff. I probably strained it when we took Flo for a walk.</p>
