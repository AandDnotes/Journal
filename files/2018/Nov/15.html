        <h1>Thursday 15th November</h1>
        <p>AAngela put some washing on (and out) early and then, as usual on a Thursday, we started by driving to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. Even though it was on his calendar, he thought that we were taking him to Southlands for his dermatology appointment! We spoke to Julie, the manager, and agreed that we could use the small conservatory on Monday for Dad's birthday.</p>
        <p>From there we went to Sainsbury's for coffee and the weekly groceries shopping. We were home in plenty of time for lunch.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage. After yesterday's run the oil level in the TC was fine, there was not too much oil in the distributor cap and the plugs looked much less sooty than before. All good signs. I also tracked down the fuel leak to the supply pipe to the front carburetter, which was duly tightened. Meanwhile, Angela was doing some tidying (there are two viewings tomorrow) and some ironing.</p>
        <p>I then installed Git and GitHub Desktop on the iMac and cloned all my repositories on both machines. I experimented with branches by creating a branch, adding yesterdays run to the outings page and then merging it back into the master.</p>
