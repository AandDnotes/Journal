        <h1>Sunday 11th November</h1>
        <p>Armistice Day and 100 years since the cessation hostilities at the end of the First World War. Angela went to church while I started cleaning the TC with warm water and a towel for drying. After lunch I finished the cleaning and waxed the top of the car. I still need to put wax under the wings. Later we spoke with Paul, Krista and Rowan. Krista had a fall last Monday and cracked a rib. So Paul has been up early each day to clean out the stalls!</p>
