        <h1>Wednesday 28th November</h1>
        <p>We had arranged to meet the plumber at Rosemary Avenue this morning to look at the boiler. He was on time and spent a couple of hours sorting things out. The condensate takes a tortuous route out, which was blocked. It was midday before we got home.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and I went down to Steyning to get cash (for Dad and for me), have my hair cut and collect my pills. Since it was a windy, showery, although warmer day, I took the car. Afterwards I put some PTFE tape around the spindle of the water stop tap, under the gland nut, to stop it leaking. I also tracked down a Meccano kit for Austin (in Spain I think) and ordered it, and sent the confirmation to the solicitor for the purchase of 31 Penlands Vale. Then I phoned iMend to find out how much they would charge to replace the battery in the MacBook Air; £65 for the battery plus £60 to do the replacement. I tracked down an original Apple battery in the UK for £44. So I will probably order that.</p>
