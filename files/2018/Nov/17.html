        <h1>Saturday 17th November</h1>
        <p>This morning we walked further than we had expected. We were up quite late and had to walk quickly down to the health centre for our flu jabs. They were well organised and it only took a few minutes. However, we found that both the newsagents and the supermarket had run out of Telegraphs. So we walked to Beeding. Luckily the Beeding newsagents had some.</p>
        <p>On our way back we stopped at the Castle Hotel for a coffee, sitting outside under a shelter, but in the sun. It was nearly midday by the time we left!</p>
        <p>When we got home I did the weekly accounts before lunch and afterwards went into the garage to prepare for removing the steering column. I eventually lifted the front of the TC just an inch or two using the screw jack and the hydraulic bottle jack,to put the front axle on the adjustable stands set at their lowest level. I removed the offside wheel in the hope that I can then reach (and remove) the drop arm from the end of the sector shaft. Meanwhile Angela cleared leaves from the gutters and then baked two cakes for Dad's birthday.</p>
        <p>Victoria et al set off early for Sacremento airport to travel to Missouri for Thanksgiving, so we were not able to talk to them.</p>
