        <h1>Thursday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>I had expected two trips out today, but ended up staying at home all day. Firstly we had expected a viewing of the house this morning from people currently renting in Henfield. They cancelled, being concerned about the work that may be done in the wood. So Angela went to do the grocery shopping and I stayed at home and wrote a blog entry about the Sussex Network STEM activities.</p>
        <p>After lunch we were expecting a second viewing from a couple who had to travel quite a way. They too cancelled, again saying they were nervous about the potential development in the wood. So Angela went round to Rosemary Avenue to check on it. Then, the people who have made an offer and were due to make a second visit (with a builder) and with Ben. But it seems that Ben has been involved in some sort of accident and no one could accompany them. So we stayed home and let them wander around, answering questions about the drains and extension rebuild.</p>
        <p>I spent quite a lot of time researching new batteries for the Macbook Air and the process of replacing it. Then I started planning the December IET newsletter.</p>
