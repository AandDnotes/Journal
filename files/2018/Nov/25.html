        <h1>Sunday 25th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I emailed Bernard and submitted the November newsletter for approval. Then I emailed Roger Ferneau to order two bushes for the steering box. John Jermy phoned about the display of the Neighbourhood Plan. I also spent some time clearing out some areas of the study.</p>
        <p>After lunch I had planned to go into the garage to start cleaning the splines on the steering column. But Victoria and the children were up early, having returned from Missouri the evening before, and so we spoke with them for quite some time. The rest of the afternoon was spent doing more clearing in the study.</p>
