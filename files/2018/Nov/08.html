        <h1>Thursday 8th November</h1>
        <p>We were a little earlier than usual on a Thursday going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. I'd seen him on Tuesday and shown him photos of our trip to Rotterdam, so there wasn't really a lot to talk about. From there we went on to do the weeks grocery shopping at Sainsbury's.</p>
        <p>So we were home in time to have lunch at our normal time. My intent had been to put a second coat of paint on the foot ramp. However, it was a fine, sunny and quite warm day and the gutters were overflowing with leaves. Also, the coming days were forecast to be wet. So I spent most of the afternoon clearing out the gutters and valley gutters (as far as I can reach with a boat hook) and then 'fixed' the pipe into the water butt by the back door. I ended up just putting some duct tape around the top to join it back together. It probably won't last very long.</p>
        <p>Then I checked some money transfers from Standard Life and from Equinity and sent an email to a young engineer who I had met last night and who works for Thales.</p>
