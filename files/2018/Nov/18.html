        <h1>Sunday 18th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to church while I did the usual uppdates on the Linux laptop and backed up files. Then I 'fixed' the phone in the sitting room, which had lost connection with the base station. I then started work on removing the steering column from the TC. I separated the drop arm from the sector shaft, removed teh bolt that holds the box to the chassis and the bolt on the steering wheel hub. The next step is to remove the wheel.</p>
        <p>By then it was lunch time and we had tickets for a concert at the Steyning Centre , starting at three. The concert, by a young saxophonist and a Turkish pianist, was good. The saxophonist had performed at the Last Night of the Proms.</p>
        <p>When we got home we spoke to Paul and Rowan, but Victoria, now in Missouri, was out.</p>
