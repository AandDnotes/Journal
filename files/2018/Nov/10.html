        <h1>Saturday 10th November</h1>
        <p>It was the church bazaar today, so the day started by taking Angela and her collection of cakes and deserts down to Steyning. I then brought the car back and later walked down to sell lunch tickets. That meant that we didn't get our lunch until after two o'clock, I didn't get home until after 3:30 and Angela wasn't home until half past four.</p>
        <p>Then we spoke to Victoria, Austin and Juniper. Austin has his cast off and next Saturday they travel to Missouri for Thanksgiving.</p>
