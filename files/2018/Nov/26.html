        <h1>Monday 26th November</h1>
        <p>Angela had to go out shortly after lunch, so she was up early so that we could go to Victoria Grand, at least half an hour earlier than usual. We got dad, who was still in his vest applying cream to his arms, to try on his new shirts. As we suspected, the 'tailored fit' shirt would not go around his tummy. We measured his waist to be 42", whereas his trousers are 38". So we went into Worthing and bought him a new pair (in a sale). Otherwise we looked for Meccano Junior (unsuccessfully) and found that although the BHF did not want a piano, GuildCare think that they would. We have to wait for a phone call from the furniture person.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI person to sort out their programme and I went into the garage. I cleaned the splines on the end of the steering column and in the wheel hub with some needle files so that the hub now slides on to the column. Hopefully the bolt will clamp it tight. I also cleaned up a bracket and checked that the column draft excluder will fit without the need for the plates either side of the foot plate.</p>
