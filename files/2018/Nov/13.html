        <h1>Tuesday 13th November</h1>
        <p>While Angela hosted a WI committee meeting I took the TC for a test drive and bought some petrol. I found that the idle speed is a bit high, but I couldn't reduce it. Probably the slow running cable is a little too 'tight'. Afterwards I went to the doctor's to review my medication. She also took my blood pressure and said that it was fine.</p>
        <p>Later we took our lunch around to Rosemary Avenue since Ben was bringing someone for a viewing at one o'clock. After lunch I went to Field Place for an RCEA talk on nuclear fusion. He was a good speaker (recently retired from Culham) and it was quite an interesting talk.</p>
