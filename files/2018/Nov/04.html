        <h1>Sunday 4th November</h1>
        <p>We had a gentle start to a fine day. Although it was cold it remained sunny all day. Paul took us all, including Flo, to a park near the centre of Rotterdam. The park surrounded a large lake on which people were sailing and there were plenty of wooded areas with good paths. There was also a children's playground and a couple of cafes. We stopped at one for lunch, sitting outside overlooking the lake.</p>
        <p>From the park we came back via Krimpen aan de Lek for coffee and cake with Greet and Wim. We sat in their relatively new garden room. When we got back we played games and had just a light snack.</p>
        <p>During our stay we had been listening to a recorded version of the first Harry Potter book in the car and reading from it to Rowan. We were getting quite hooked!</p>
