        <h1>Tuesday 6th November</h1>
        <p>I started by loading photos taken over the weekend to the iPad and then went to Victoria Grand to show them to Dad. They were having a staff training session, so I had to park around the corner.</p>
        <p>When I got home I did the weekly accounts and started the monthly accounts. We are still feeling tired after our long weekend away. After lunch Angela went to a WI meeting in Ashurst and I gave the underside of the offside front wing, running board and rear wheel arch a second coat of paint.</p>
