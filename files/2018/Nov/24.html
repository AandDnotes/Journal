        <h1>Saturday 24th November</h1>
        <p>Our walk to the newsagents this morning was a little extended. We bought a paper in the Beeding newsagents and then walked back to the Indian restaurant in Bramber, where a display of the Neighbourhood Plan was being held. The wood and part of Clays Field were the only parcels of land that had been submitted for consideration as candidates for future development. This took most of the morning, just leaving time to do the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>We had received details relating to the house sale from the solicitor, asking for photo ID and proof of address. So I sent them this information. Then I finished the December IET newsletter and got the system to send a test copy to Bernard. I also set up a new version of Angela's WI programme leaflet and she made the amendments for this year's programme.</p>
        <p>Also during the afternoon we tried to speak with Victoria, but they had changed their flight to an earlier one due to forecast bad weather. So we spoke with Paul et al.</p>
