        <h1>Friday 9th November</h1>
        <p>I stayed home all day today. I'd intended going to the SRFC AGM, but it was a wild evening and it's difficult to build up the enthusiasm to go out on a Friday evening. So I watched the first episode of 'The First' instead.</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went to Steyning, but called into the church and so did not get home until nearly midday. I spent most of the morning applying for our ESTAs. It turned out that mine was still valid, but Angela's had expired when her passport expired. So I renewed both.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I put a second coat of paint on the foot ramp of the TC and then wrote up some notes on our trip to Berkenwouder in August.</p>
