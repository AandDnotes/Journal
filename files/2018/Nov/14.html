        <h1>Wednesday 14th November</h1>
        <p>A fairly warm and sunny day. I left home just before ten in the TC and drove to the Sportsman pub at Goddards Green (about 12 miles) to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. I then followed a red MGF on the run to The Farmers Inn at Scaynes Hill, about 23 miles. After a good lunch I returned home along the A272 and tehn down through Henfield. The TC ran well, although there was a smell of petrol all the way home.</p>
        <p>I got home at three o'clock. Angela was still at table tennis, so I installed Git and GitHub Desktop on the MacBook, cloned the WebPages repository and moved directories around.</p>
