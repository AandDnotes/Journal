        <h1>Friday 9th March</h1>
        <p>Since I had been out all day yesterday I went to see Dad this morning, calling in at Berriedale on the way. Meanwhile, Angela went to help Sanie with the Mothering Sunday flowers. After lunch Angela took the quilt cover back to M&S, to change it for the colour she wanted (and that I should have bought), and I scanned in more photos.</p>
