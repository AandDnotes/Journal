        <h1>Saturday 17th March</h1>
        <p>A late breakfast and a ride over into Warwickshire to a mansion that had been converted into an art gallery. There was just a light dusting of snow, but a very cold wind (the outside temerature managed to get to zero degrees). After a 45 minute drive we started with coffee and then toured most of the galleries before stopping for lunch in the cafe. We then finished the tour before leaving and arriving back by about 5:15. Then dinner and games.</p>
