        <h1>Saturday 31st March</h1>
        <p>It was a day of doing odd jobs, mainly on the computer. I took a photo of the cot and advertised it on Freegle, cancelled the garden waste bin for Rosemary Avenue and did the weekly accounts while Angela went to Steying and to Rosemary Avenue. After lunch Angela planted seeds and cooked while I started trying to sort out her tax bill for 2016/17. I also added a little to my latest article for Main Gear.</p>
