        <h1>Tuesday 13th March</h1>
        <p>An early start to get over to Berriedale by eight o'clock to wait for the British Gas service man, who arrived at 9:30. He left at 10:45 having replaced gaskets in the pump (to fix the leak), replaced the ionisation probe (hopefully to fix the repeated failure) and checked everything else. I got home at about 11:15. Meanwhile, Angela had been to Steying and to Rosemary Avenue. After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting at Field Place. The talk was on a railway journey across India. On the way home I filled the Panda with petrol and bought some screenwash. Then a stone made a chip in the windscreen! Later, I finished drafting the IET newsletter and sent a test to Bernard.</p>
