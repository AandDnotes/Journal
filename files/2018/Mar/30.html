        <h1>Friday 30th March</h1>
        <p>Today happens to be Paul's birthday. Although it was Good Friday, he had to work. We set off fairly early (well, just before nine) to go to Berriedale Drive. Alan and Chris had arrived late last night and Alan had already cleared quite a lot of the first shed into the skip, so I started on the small shed at the bottom of the garden while Angela and Chris tackled the greenhouse. We had almost filled the skip by lunchtime! So before we had lunch lunch we filled Alan's van and took it to the Shoreham tip. After lunch we filled it again and took it the Worthing tip. We then loaded the washing machine, microwave and folding bed into the van and brought the bed home, before they set off for Tilsworth.</p>
