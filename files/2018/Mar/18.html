        <h1>Sunday 18th March</h1>
        <p>Another late breakfast and a trip in Dick's car. This time they took us to a posh hotel to have 'afternoon tea', even though we started it at 12:30. This was a treat for our 70th birthdays. We had sandwiches, savories, scones and cakes, along with as much tea as we wanted plus an alcoholic drink. A little odd having ber and tea. Again it was very cold and a good half inch of snow. We left them at about 3:30. The M40 was dry, but it started snowing when we got to the M25 and continued the rest of the way home, although by then it was very wet and not settling. Once we had unpacked we spoke to Victoria and then to Paul, talking to Alan in between. He and Chris had been down to Berriedale and cleared the loft.</p>
