        <h1>Monday 19th March</h1>
        <p>I started the day with a visit to Dad while Angela went down to Steyning and to Rosemary Avenue. I stayed on the main road in case the snow was still on the Downs. After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I went for a check-up at the dentist. I then signed the contract and land transfer to send to Alan.</p>
