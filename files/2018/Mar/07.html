        <h1>Wednesday 7th March</h1>
        <p>More scanning of photos. After lunch I went to Brighton to a meeting about projects for which STEM Sussex could apply for an IET/IMechE EEGS grant. Later I emailed the 'schools' team to ask for suggestions. On the way back from Brighton I called into M&S (who were having a 20% off promotion) and bought a quilt cover and a linen jacket.</p>
