        <h1>Monday 12th March</h1>
        <p>Angela got an early call to ask her to help at the lunch club. While she was there, I did more to the draft newsletter. Then I went to the optician, with Angela following me. After lunch we went to visit Dad. I 'escaped' to the WSMGOC meeting while Angela hosted her WI committee meeting.</p>
