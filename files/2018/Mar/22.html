        <h1>Thursday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>After scanning in some photos we set off to Berriedale. I phoned BT, sinced there was a letter from them saying that someone had requested to take over the phone line on April 16th. This is likely to be before completion, but they suggested leaving it as it is. We then went on to visit Dad, taking him the last box of photos, before going to Waitrose for coffee and to do our weekly shop. After a late lunch I reconciled the bank statement against our accounts and did some more work the 'family tree'.</p>
