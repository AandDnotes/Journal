        <h1>Wednesday 14th March</h1>
        <p>This morning I took the Panda to Halfords in Shoreham to try to get the chip in the windscreen and for the slow leak in the tyre to be looked at. They could not do either today. So I bought a chip repair kit and repaired the chip on the drive. Luckily it was a sunny day. In between I printed the certificates for the Egg Race. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and, a little later, I collected Mike Wooldridge and on to a STEM workshop on building fan boats. After dinner I sent an outline of two potential projects for IET/IMechE funding.</p>
