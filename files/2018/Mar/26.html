        <h1>Monday 26th March</h1>
        <p>We started by calling in at Berriedale Drive on the way to the hospital, where Angela had an appointment about her ears. I went on to visit Dad, where I put the 'Butch' photo ina a frame. I found Angela still in the waiting room, but about to see the doctor (and then the consultant). Afterwards we walked into Worthing to get some documents certified in Barclays and to pick up a free Easter egg! After a late lunch I cut the grass, front and back and then checked Dad's finances. Later I added teh family tree map to the home page of the new web site.</p>
