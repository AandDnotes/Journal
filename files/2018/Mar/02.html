        <h1>Friday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>Not much new snow, but a grey day and still very cold. We walked to Rosemary Avenue so as to turn off the water, just in case a pipe has frozen. Angela went on to the library and shops, while I walked back home to get lunch. We needed to have lunch early, since Angela had an event early afterwards. I loaded the videos of Rowan skating on to the iPad so that I can show Dad, and spent more time preparing 'mugshots' for the family tree site. We also made considerable progress on the jigsaw.</p>
