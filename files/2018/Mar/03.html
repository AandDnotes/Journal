        <h1>Saturday 3rd March</h1>
        <p>We spent the morning at Rosemary Avenue, looking through boxes and taking photos after we had walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. After lunch we finished the jigsaw before we got ready to walk down to the Tollgate for the WSMGOC Annual Dinner. Luckily the weather was only a little driizzly and not too cold.</p>
