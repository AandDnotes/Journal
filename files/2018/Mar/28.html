        <h1>Wednesday 28th March</h1>
        <p>This morning we took Bay's jewelry to Toovey's for valuation. it took just over an hour, but we forgot to take Sam's medal strip (only the badges, pips and ceremonial strip). So I took the medals back after lunch while Angela went to table tennis. The weather was too wet to contemplate taking the TC on the pub run.</p>
