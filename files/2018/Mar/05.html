        <h1>Monday 5th March</h1>
        <p>Before we were quite ready this morning (still undressed) we had a call from Val and John's window cleaners. We then went to Berriedale Drive before going on to visit Dad. We showed him the video clips of Rowan ice skating. Then we went on to Worthing, but only bought some socks! After lunch we sorted out some more photos and I complete the three core (most recent) family tree pages. Later I received an email from James Vause of e.on, saying that he could not now find anyone who could give the talk on the Rampion wind farm. So I emailed Chris Tomlinson to see if he can help.</p>
