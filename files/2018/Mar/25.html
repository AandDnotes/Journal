        <h1>Sunday 25th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the usual upgrades and backups. Then I completed the main structural pages of the 'family tree' site and started researching how to create a small map of the tree. After lunch, while Angela sorted through Bay's jewelry I started the TC and took it for a drive, twice around the figure of eight. Later we talked with Victoria et al and then Paul et al.</p>
