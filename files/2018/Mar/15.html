        <h1>Thursday 15th March</h1>
        <p>We started by visiting Dad and then went on to do a little shopping before lunch. Afterwards, Angela picked up her new glasses and went to a funeral, while I finished preparing for the evening's Egg Race. I also sent a signed form to the solicitor. Then I went to Brighton for the Egg Race. It was a good evening.</p>
