        <h1>Thursday 1st March</h1>
        <p>Today was the start of meterological Spring, but the temperature was below freezing all day! Luckily the snow had more or less dissapeared and the roads were dry. So, in spite of the weather warnings, we went to Berriedale and then on to visit Dad. We failed to find Mum's death certificate, but we did find an ammunition box containing their wills, old passports and Enduring Power of Attorneys! We went on to Sainsbury's for coffee and to do a little food shopping and were home in time for a normal lunch. Then I ordered a copy of the death certificate and completed as much of the IHT forms as can be done at this point in time. In between we did some more jigsaw.</p>
