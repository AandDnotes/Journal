        <h1>Saturday 24th March</h1>
        <p>We started wiht a walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper, before going on to Rosemary Avenue, where Angela collected Bay's jewelry. Apart from doing the weekly accounts, that was all we did this morning. After lunch Angela worked in the back garden and I cleaned, sharpenned and adjusted three pairs of secetures.</p>
