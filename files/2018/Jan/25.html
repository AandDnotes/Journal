        <h1>Thursday 25th January</h1>
        <p>The day started with a visit to Victoria Grand. Dad's forehead has healed well and the stitches have been removed. We finished putting his photos into albums and then went on to do our weekly food shop. After lunch we went to Santander in Shoreham to close Bay's 1-2-3 account. We discovered that she also had an ISA with them! We then made an apointment to visit Nationwide tomorrow afternoon, following getting Angus of Hamilton-Graham to value Bay's house in the morning.</p>
