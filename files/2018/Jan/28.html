        <h1>Sunday 28th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I revised my minutes of the last Sussex LN meeting and checked the situation about primary residence relief for IHT. After lunch I cleared the drain on the drive and cut down part of a bush/tree in the wood that was hanging over our roof. Meanwhile, Angela cleaned the mud off the Panda. We then spoke to Paul and Rowan and then to Victoria and Austin. In between I continued to experiment with SVG and javascript in HTML. With thoughts of building some family tree web pages I protoyped some functions that would build lines between photos/text on the page.</p>
