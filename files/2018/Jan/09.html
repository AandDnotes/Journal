        <h1>Tuesday 9th January</h1>
        <p>Angela cooked oranages for marmalade while I reviewed the Barefoot slides. We then visited Bay in hospital. She has deteriorated over the past few days. We had to wear a plastic apron, gloves and a mask. After lunch I went to an RCEA talk and when I got home I almost left straight away to go to Crawley for an IET talk on physics modelling for engineering design.</p>
