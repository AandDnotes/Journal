        <h1>Friday 5th January</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning doing the monthly accounts and setting up this year's accounts spreadsheet. Meanwhile, Angela took most of her lunch club vegetables down to the church kitchen. After lunch we went into Worthing to firstly set up standing orders for our regular savings accounts and then to visit Bay. She was hallucinating and quite confused.</p>
