        <h1>Tuesday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>While Angela walked to Bay's and the library I started looking at the Barefott slides. Later I modified my Keynote version to put back some build steps that would not translate from PowerPoint. At 3:20 we got a call from the British Gas technician and we met him at Dad's. He couldn't find any leak, thinking that the water was rain that had come in via the air input. However, he did put a sleeve on a cable whose insulation was breaking down. Angela left us and visited Bay (who was asleep) and then we called into Sainsury's on the way home.</p>
