        <h1>Thursday 11th January</h1>
        <p>Shopping day. But we started by going to Berridale Drive to collect a bag full of photo frames. We also found that the boiler had stopped and there was water on the worktop. It started after pushing the reset button. We then went on to visit Dad, leaving him with the frames to extract the photos. Then we went to the hospital. We had to dress up again. Bay seemed to recognise us, but kept drifting off to sleep. We could not understand what she was saying, since her voice was weak and slurred. We then did our food shopping and had a late lunch. Then I modified the January newsletter and submitted it for approval. This evening I joined in with a conference call on the Egg Race, which made good progress.</p>
