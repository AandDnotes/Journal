        <h1>Friday 26th January</h1>
        <p>We met Angus Graham, of Hamilton Graham, at Rosmary Avenue this morning so that he could provide us with a valuation of the house for probate. We brought back most of the food from the kitchen cupboards, along with some letters and photos. We then went into Steyning to visit the florist. After lunch we went into Worthing to firstly visit Nationwide and then to Barclays, in both cases to close accounts. From there we collected the spare keys for Berriedale from Di and took them to the Jacobs Steel office in Lancing. We then walked down to Gardener & Scardifield to buy a couple of circlips to fix the bread maker. Unfortunately, they were just too small, perhaps imperial rather than metric.</p>
