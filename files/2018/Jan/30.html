        <h1>Tuesday 30th January</h1>
        <p>We started in Steyning, calling in at the florist and undertakers. Then, following a visit to Berriedale to pick up some boxes of files, we went to visit Dad in Worthing Hospital. He was in an isolation ward, since he is being treated for flu! The doctor said that it would be 5-7 days before he was likely to be clear. We then went to Victoria Grand to collect his glasses and teeth! After a late lunch we continued with contacting investment companies about Bay's death. I also updated the IET schools web site.</p>
