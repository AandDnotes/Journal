        <h1>Tuesday 16th January</h1>
        <p>I spent some of the morning drafting an email to Jeremy Watson about a talk, while Angela went to Storrington to pay in her WI money. I also put together some notes about an IET Sussex business event and sent them to Bernard for comment. In the afternoon I went to Elm Grove School in Worthing to help give a Barefoot workshop. Dave Reeve did most of the presentation (slowly), so I didn't think it went very well.</p>
