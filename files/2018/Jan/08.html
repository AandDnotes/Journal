        <h1>Monday 8th January</h1>
        <p>I took Angela (and her stewed apple) down to the church this morning so that she could cook for the lunch club. I then took the TC, firstly to Berriedale Drive and then on to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. Later in the afternoon I had a call from a doctor at the hospital. Angela called her back when she got home. It seems that Bay has a chest infection and is being given oxygen. She is calm and sleeping, but may not pull through. After an early tea, Angela's WI committee arived for their meeting and then I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington. It was well attended.</p>
