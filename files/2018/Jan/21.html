        <h1>Sunday 21st January</h1>
        <p>Today I wiped the drive on the old iMac and installed a fresh OS before cleaning it and putting it back in its original box. I also started looking at the Probate and IHT forms, downloading another set that seem to be required. We spoke to Paul and then Victoria as usual. Paul has suffered another gale (but not too much damage this time) and Victoria is going for her US citizenship interview tomorrow.</p>
