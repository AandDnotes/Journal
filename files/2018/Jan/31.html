        <h1>Wednesday 31st January</h1>
        <p>Firstly we went to the Post Office sorting office at Henfield to pick up a letter that had to be signed-for. Then on to Victoria Grand to pick up some clean clothes for Dad before visiting him at Worthing hospital. He was still in the Emergency Floor, but was very unwell. I still needed to dress up, since he is in an isolation room. I called the hospital later in teh afternoon to find that he was still the same. After lunch, while Angela was at table tennis, I spent most of the time dealing with IET email of varios types. Later we continued going through Dad's old files.</p>
