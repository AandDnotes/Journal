        <h1>Monday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day. We were too tired to wait up last night for the transition into the New Year and today we kept forgetting that it was January 1st. We started by going to Berriedale Drive and collecting paintings and photos, as well as a couple of pairs of Dad's trousers that we had forgotten to pack. Then we were off to Victoria Grand to hang said paintings and photos, as well as the trousers. Dad was having his lunch in the dining room when we left for the hospital. There, the nurses were washing Bay, even though she was asleep. She had had what the nurse called a 'lively night'; wanting to get up, not wanting to have a drip fitted and talking all the time. So we went for coffee, but she was still fast asleep when we returned. After a late lunch we watched the first episode (of three) of the TV adaptation of Little Women, before reading and then preparing dinner. Afterwards we watched the second episode. All in all a very exciting first day of the year!</p>
