        <h1>Saturday 13th January</h1>
        <p>For me the morning was about doing the weekly accounts and reconciling the bank statement. Meanwhile, Angela finished pruning the raspberry canes. After lunch we walked to Bay's to sort out her post and empty her fridge. I then worked through the Barefoot sliides in preparation for Tuesday's workshop. We didn't visit Bay today, since Lyn and Janice went to see her.</p>
