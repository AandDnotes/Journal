        <h1>Thursday 4th January</h1>
        <p>Angela started by going to Steyning. Then we went Via Bay's (where I changed the batteries in two smoke detectors, to no avail) and to Berriedale Drive on our way to visit Dad. As he went down for lunch we went on to visit Bay. She was about to have lunch; so we had a coffee. She was then quite vocal and coherent. Later in the day we had a call from her doctor, talking about how they want to discharge her. We need to find a nursing home that can handle her immobility. After leaving the hospital we called into Sainsbury's to do the lunch club shopping and some of our own. Before we had dinner I gave the Panda a quick wash.</p>
