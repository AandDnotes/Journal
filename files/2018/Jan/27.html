        <h1>Saturday 27th January</h1>
        <p>We started by walking to Beeding to buy a newspaper and then walked by the river and across the fields (in the mud) to Rosmary Avenue. We called on some of the neighbours and collected some more food. When we got home I did the weekly accounts while Angela started writing letters to Bay's friends. She continued after lunch and I drafted the minutes of the Sussex LN committee meeting. After dinner we tried to watch something via Chromecast. Firstly it would not find the Lounge network (nor would the TalkTalk router). After reconnecting the Ethernet cables the router appeared, but I couldn't get Chromecast to connect to it. We tried it connected to the study router, but there were continual buffering stops. So we gave up!</p>
