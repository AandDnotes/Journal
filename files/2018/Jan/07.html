        <h1>Sunday 7th January</h1>
        <p>A bright, sunny, but cold and windy day. So I stayed inside. Angela went to church while I backed up files, updated software and complained to TalkTalk about the quality of their broadband service. After lunch we phoned the hospital to find that Bay is coughing, so might well have flu. The bay of the ward she is in is still isolated due to flu. Also, she was still sleeping a lot, so we didn't visit her. Later we spoke to Paul and then Victoria. Paul had been busy cutting up fallen trees and righting the stumps. Angela cooked apple for the lunch club tomorrow.</p>
