        <h1>Friday 12th January</h1>
        <p>A tiring, but, at least initially, a fun day. I left home at 7:15 this morning and drove to Gatwick, to the FIRST Lego League regional heat. I got home before five. Meanwhile Angela had been making more marmalade and a bread pudding. We then went to visit Bay. When we got there they said that the bay was clear of flu and that we didn't need to mask-up. However, after a few minutes they said that new results showed that Bay still had flu. They had just given the bay a deep clean, so they moved her into a single bed room. She was clearly in some discomfort and could make herself heard. When we got home I emailed Lyn, who may visit Bay tomorrow.</p>
