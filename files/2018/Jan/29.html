        <h1>Monday 29th January</h1>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent visiting Dad. He had a bit of a chesty cough. After lunch, the minister called to discuss Bay's funeral. Then Victoria Grand phoned to say that Dad was unwell and they had called 111. The paramedics took him to A&E. We got there at about five o'clock, but Dad was still waiting to be admitted. We went back later and found that Dad had the same symptoms as before Christmas. They kept him in over night.</p>
