        <h1>Saturday 6th January</h1>
        <p>The first part of the morning was spent taking down the Christmas decorations and putting them back in the loft. I then cleaned out the gutters, since they had been overflowing. It was cold and my hands were numb. I felt quite sick when I came in. After lunch Angela went into Worthing to buy things for marmalade and to visit Bay. But there is flu in the ward and Bay was asleep. Meanwhile I did the weekly accounts and sent a small article off for Main Gear.</p>
