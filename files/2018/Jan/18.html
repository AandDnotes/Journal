        <h1>Thursday 18th January</h1>
        <p>We were early for our appointment with the Registrar, but the 'cuse of death' entered by the doctor was of concern. So she consulted the Coroner's office and they decided that a new certificate would be required. However, the Coroner's office called as we were driving home to say that all was well, the Coroner would sign 'Form A' and we could get the death certificate. So we now have another appointment for Monday at 3:30. We did some shopping in Sainsbury's on the way home and after lunch we went to Santander in Shoreham. They were of little more help than Barclays had been yesterday. However, we need to take the death certificate in next week. Between these outings I phoned a number of Bay's pension providers and utilities providers to inform them of her death and start the process of closing them. I also arranged to meet two estate agents at Berriedale Drive tomorrow.</p>
