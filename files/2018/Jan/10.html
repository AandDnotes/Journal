        <h1>Wednesday 10th January</h1>
        <p>For me, the day was about two things, drafting this month's newsletter and meeting Dave Reeves (my Barefoot partner next week). It started for Angela with an early appointment at the doctors about her hearing. After lunch, which I had with Dave, Angela went to table tennis. We phoned the hospital and were told that Bay was very sleepy, so we didn't visit today. Before dinner I had completed the draft newsletter and got it sent to Bernard, John and Supreeth.</p>
