        <h1>Wednesday 17th January</h1>
        <p>A busy day. It started with an early departure to collect Dad and take him to Southlands for a spot on his forehead to be removed. This went well, but I did not have time to come home to get lunch, so bought some lunch and went to Berriedale to wait for the aids to be collected. But they had tried calling at nine o'clock! However, after a phone call they came at about 2:30. I did a little 'tidying' and arranged to collect Bay's belongings (and medical certificate) from Worthing hospital and so went there just after three. When I got home I booked the only slot left at the registrar this week and cancelled the boiler repair visit tomorrow (it was working today). I tried making an appointment at Barclays, but all they wanted to do was freeze Bay's account! So I made an appointment to see someone at Santander. After an early meal I went to the IET talk on Machine Learning. Wow!</p>
