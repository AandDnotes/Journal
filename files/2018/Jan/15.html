        <h1>Monday 15th January</h1>
        <p>We started by phoning Worthing hospital about Bay's things, but were told that we needed to phone the 'bereavement unit' after 12:00. They said they would phone us when the items were ready. They haven't phoned yet. So we went to Berriedale (the boiler had stopped again, and leaked) and then went on to visit Dad. Afterwards we did some food shopping and had lunch before coming home. Angela then went to a service for Philip and went on to her WI meeting. I started listing things to do as a result of Bay's death. Later I went to to an IET events sub-committee meeting.</p>
