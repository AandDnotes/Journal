        <h1>Sunday 14th January</h1>
        <p>A sad day. A nurse at Worthing hospital phoned us at about 7:30pm to say that Bay had passed away. We had been in to see her this afternoon. She was still in her isolation room, so we masked up. She would not respond to our voices or touch. However, she was 'gurgling' as she breathed. So we got the nurses to look at her. They suctioned out the fluid. The nurse phoned firstly at about five, while we were talking with Victoria, to say that Bay was deteriorating.</p>
