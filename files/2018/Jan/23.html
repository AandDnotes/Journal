        <h1>Tuesday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>We spent an hour at the RBS bank in Worthing, freezing Bay's accounts and opening an executor's account. We can pay money into her existing current account by cheque (made payable to 'The late G. Alcock') and RBS will pay bills against invoices, including inheritance tax. When we got home I phoned Barclays and froze her account there. It seems that we can go into a branch and withdraw the money (since it is less than Â£50K) in the form of a cheque. After lunch we visited Chalcraft and arranged Bay's funeral. Later, John Berry called (after visiting Dave Hartley at Steyning Grammar) to say that he was resigning as SLO! He left the literature and equipment.</p>
