        <h1>Friday 18th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I finished the May IET newsletter and made another mirror extension for the TC. However, both mirrors are still knocked by the side screens when the doors are openned! After an early dinner I took the TC to Patching to meet with Hamish and Ramon to talk about SLO role.</p>
