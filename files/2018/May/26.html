        <h1>Saturday 26th May</h1>
        <p>It seems a while since we walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper, but we did that this morning. Angela then worked int he garden and I wrote some email. Fairly early we had a call from Alan to say that they were in Arundel and would be calling in to see Dad after lunch. I did a little more cleaning of the gutters and facias before Chris and Alan arrived to pick up the boxes of china from Berriedale and have a cup of tea. After an early dinner we walked down to the Steyning Centre to see Heber Opera's performance of Rigaletto. It was a good evening.</p>
