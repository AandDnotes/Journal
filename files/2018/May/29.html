        <h1>Tuesday 29th May</h1>
        <p>An overcast day today, but still quite warm and humid. We went off this morning to Shoreham to park and catch the 700 bus into Brighton. We started with a stop for coffee before going to the probate office, where Angela swore her oath for the probate application for Bay's estate. It only took a few minutes and was done over the counter. After a walk to Churchill Square to visit Lakeland (about our leaking bread maker) we caught the bus back to Shoreham, getting home at about 1:15. After a late lunch Angela spent most of the afternoon in the garden while I wrote some IET email, updated my TC fuel sender unit web page with notes and photos of my recent work and typed some more pages of Dad's notes.</p>
