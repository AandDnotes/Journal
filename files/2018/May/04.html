        <h1>Friday 4th May</h1>
        <p>A gloriously sunny day, but Angela spent most of the day at church meetings or helping to prepare for the flower festival and I tiedied up some of Dad's things, including the tool stool. We also did a little in the garden and I 'played' with my rearrangement of the web pages.</p>
