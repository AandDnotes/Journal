        <h1>Sunday 20th May</h1>
        <p>It took most of the morning for the Windows upgrades to complete. Otherwise I added a little more of Dad's notes to the web page. I also continued cleaning the paint and Blue Hylomar off parts of the TC's sender unit. Later, after we had spoken to Victoria, I gave the body and cover a coat of primer. I also cut a new gasket. Angela went to church in the morning and worked in the garden in the afternoon.</p>
