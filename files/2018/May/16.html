        <h1>Wednesday 16th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI friends, a lot of the morning was spent preparing for the evening IET talk. I updated the slides and downloaded the attendance list. 109 people had registered and Chris had catered for 95. After lunch I finished adjusting the door catch on the TC. I had to remove a brocken screw in the wood post to which the latch striker is attached. I also greased the pins in the door hinges on both sides. Then it was time to drive to Sussex University for the talk. The food had been piled up, but there was no space to spread it out. So I moved the only two tables in the foyer. I didn't get any food, but we had 97 attendees (at least those who ticked the sheet). Feedback on the talk was positive.</p>
