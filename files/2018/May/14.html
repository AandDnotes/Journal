        <h1>Monday 14th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to Steyning while I went over to Victoria Grand to see Dad. I was home just before lunch. After lunch I drafted the May issue of the IET newsletter, which took most of the afternoon. Just after the start of Angela's WI committee meeting I took the TC over to West Chiltington to the WSMGOC meeting, getting home at about 9:30, just before it got too dark.</p>
