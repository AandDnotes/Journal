        <h1>Monday 28th May</h1>
        <p>Today was a bank holiday; not that it makes a lot of difference to us. We started by taking a drive along Worthing seafront to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. The morning and first part of the afternoon were gloriously sunny and hot. The we had a torrential thunder storm. Losts of thunder and lightning and lots of rain. It didn't last that long, so Angela was able to get back out in the garden. I wrote a several email related to IET schools activities, finished the web page on our visit to Berkenwoude in April and typed up some more of Dad's notes.</p>
