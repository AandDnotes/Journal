        <h1>Thursday 24th May</h1>
        <p>A relatively early start. I drove to Brighton to help interviewing three candidates for a post in the Philanthropy and Alumni department. I got home by about 2:30. I then spent some of the afternoon refitting the TC's sender unit. It was tricky to get Blue Hylomar into the bolt threads. I will put the petrol back in the tank tomorrow or Saturday and hope that it does not pour out!</p>
