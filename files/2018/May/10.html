        <h1>Thursday 10th May</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We started in Worthing at RBS (returning there later) to give them an IHT form. We then called into Barclays to get Rosemary Avenue's energy bill paid, before going to Santander to register the LPA so that I can operate Dad's accounts. Then Nationwide, who insisted on giving us a cheque made payable to HMRC, and Millets (for canvas water-proofer) before coffee in M&amp;S and to Victoria Grand to see Dad. Afterwards we did the shopping at Sainsbury's and still got home in time to watch the news while eating lunch. Later in teh afternoon I gave the TC's hood a coat of waterproofer.</p>
