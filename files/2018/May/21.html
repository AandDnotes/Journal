        <h1>Monday 21st May</h1>
        <p>On the way to Victoria Grand this morning I called into Argos to buy Dad a new electric shaver. I then showed him some photos and videos of Austin's birthday and karate. Angela had her WI meeting this afternoon, so I typed up more of Dad's notes and gave the TC's sender unit a fist coat of paint. After dinner (which I cooked while Anglea counted her WI money) we spoke with Paul.</p>
