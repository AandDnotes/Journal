        <h1>Tuesday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>Angela took her WI cash to Storrington on the bus this morning while I sent some IET related email and paid Dad's newspaper bill. After lunch I cut the front and back grass, although I used the mulcher and the grass had not grown much. Otherwise, Angela worked in the garden and I typed up a few more pages of Dad's notes.</p>
