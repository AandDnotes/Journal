        <h1>Tuesday 15th May</h1>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent cutting the front and rear grass. I had lowered the mower cutting level, so there was a lot of grass to spread. Afterwards I started investigating why the TC's driver's door was not closing properly. I may be that the door has never been closing properly! I had thought that the catch striker would be adjustable, but it is not. So I started romoving some wood so that the striker is closer to the outside.</p>
