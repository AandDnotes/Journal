        <h1>Friday 11th May</h1>
        <p>All morning was spent collecting Dad and taking him to his appointment at Southlands Hospital. Dr Ali 'froze' a spot on Dad's temple and another on his ear, but otherwise all was well. I got him back to Victoria Grand at one o'clock, leaving him to have lunch. Meanwhile Anglea went to Rosemary Avenue and Steyning and worked in the front garden. After a very late lunch I caught up with some IET email and prepared things to take to the 'STEM in the Park' event in Crawley tomorrow. We also had a quick chat with Austin on his sixth birthday.</p>
