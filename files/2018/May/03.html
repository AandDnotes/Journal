        <h1>Thursday 3rd May</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday we started by visiting Dad. We drove down Berriedale Drive on the way and saw a skip on the front. We got Dad to sign a change of address form for his Civil Service Pension, two applications for NS&I bonds, all 15 pages of a certified LPA and two cheques. Then into Worthing to bank the WI cash before going to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I finished cutting the grass.</p>
