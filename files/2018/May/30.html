        <h1>Wednesday 30th May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI friends I cleaned out the inside of the bread maker. Yesterday when I asked an assistant in Lakeland if they could get a new bowl for it, she said just bring the whole thing in and they would replace it! Then I completed typing up Dad's notes before finishing cleaning the front soffit and gutter and cleaning out all the gutters. Yesterday they overflowed during a storm and more rain is forcast for tomorrow. Then I took the TC to get some petrol before we took it to Ashington for a WSMGOC Pub Run. We had a good meal and interesting company. We were home just after 9:30.</p>
