        <h1>Sunday 27th May</h1>
        <p>A relatively lazy day. It was hot and humid, so not a day to work. While Angela was a t church I spent some of the morning writing a blob about local technology for the IET Admin Group competition. Then I topped up the oil in the near-side damper on the TC and tightened the bolts holding on the badge bar. After lunch I helped Angela put in the bean poles before we spoke with Paul and then Victoria. I also typed up a couple of pages of Dad's notes (half way now).</p>
