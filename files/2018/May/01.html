        <h1>Tuesday 1st May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning to help run a coffee meorning at the cricket club. Shortly after, Brandon left, heading for Heathrow and then Toulouse. I then spent most of the morning working out how to invest the money from the sale of Dad's house. After lunch I updated the IET slideshow and then cut the front and half of the rear grass. Later I went to the IET talk on Fusion in Crawley.</p>
