        <h1>Saturday 5th May</h1>
        <p>Most of the day was spent at the Methodist church. I dropped Angela there first thing, with her cakes, and then joined her later, after picking up a newspaper. She worked in the kitchen and I sold lunch tickets. After a late lunch I came home, printed off the final documents needed for the IHT/probate submission and did the weekly accounts. I then started the monthly accounts (for two months) before we had some tea and walked to the Steyning Centre for a Music Society concert. Unusually it was a trio of harp, viola and flute. Interesting and, in parts, very good.</p>
