        <h1>Wednesday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>This morning, since it was raining, Angela's WI walking group met in Steyning for coffee! Meanwhile, I sent details of the Falmer campus to my eon man and filled in the forms to invest Dad's house money. Then I managed to contact the care home director and agreed to pay what I thought we owed to them for Dad's care so far. I also set up a monthly standing order, paying this month's bill seperately. After lunch I ammended the final IHT forms and uploaded more files to my GitHub web repository.</p>
