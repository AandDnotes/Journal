        <h1>Thursday 31st May</h1>
        <p>We had a relatively early visit to Victoria Grand today and so we started our weekly groceries shop earlier. When we got home there was a letter from HMRC about the IHT on the property part of the estate. It stated that we owed them quite a lot of money. So I phoned them and found that we should be getting a similar letter about the 'liquid' part of the estate. They also confirmed that all three payments into the account had been made, so we don't owe them anything. After lunch Angela went to Steyning and to Rosemary Avenue, while I walked to Beeding to get my hair cut. The barbers was full of children, so I walked to Steyning. They had a cancellation and so I got my hair cut.</p>
