        <h1>Tuesday 8th May</h1>
        <p>Breakfast was somewhat disturbed by the window cleaners appearing! However, they didn't finish off the front and side windows properly, so I had to go over them with a leather. Angela went down to Steyning while I finished the monthly accounts and then put the descaler in the central heating system. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I cut the grass, front and back. Then we checked the IHT and probate forms and got them ready for posting.</p>
