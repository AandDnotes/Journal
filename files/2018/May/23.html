        <h1>Wednesday 23rd May</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking, I read the documents for tomorrow's interviews at Brighton and made a start on cleaning the gutters and facias. The TC's senduer unit gasket and the radiator shell tape arrived from the Octagon Club. After lunch I fitted the cover on to the unit. The Blue Hylomar made a terrible mess all over the unit. I found that methylated spirit was a solvent. Unfortunately it also removed the paint! So I re-painted the unit and cover and will try fitting it to the tank tomorrow (or Friday). Then I removed the old radiator tape and fitted the new one. It doesn't seem that much less hard then the original. I also typed up a few more pages of Dad's notes.</p>
