        <h1>Wednesday 9th May</h1>
        <p>Angela went off fairly early to join her walking friends and I drove the TC along the back of the Downs to Ditchling, where I met up with members of the Sussex Wanderers for coffee. I then followed a TD (and was followed by a Porsche Boxter) for about 30 miles, finally driving up the old hill climb at Firle. Then lunch before taking the most direct route home, 69 miles in all.</p>
