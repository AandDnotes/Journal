        <h1>Friday 25th May</h1>
        <p>We started by going to the mail sorting office at Small Dole to collect the LPA that they had tried to deliver yesterday. We then went on to Victoria Grand. While we were there, John and Laura arrived. We then went on to Majestic to buy a couple of bottles of wine (using a Â£10 voucher) before doing the food shopping at Sainsbury's. Their coffee machines were not working, so we shopped and went on to the garden centre, bought some hanging basket liner and came home for a late lunch. Afterwards I put the petrol back in the TC's tank and replaced the spare wheel carrier. After an early dinner I took the TC to 'The World's End' to meet Hamish and Gavin to talk about the SLO role, getting back at about 9:15.</p>
