        <h1>Saturday 19th May</h1>
        <p>I went down to Steyning this morning to post the original LPA to NS&I (who did not accept a certified copy with the words printed on each page, rather than 'stamped' or had-written) and buy a newspaper. Meanwhile Angela went to a coffee morning. When I got home I did the weekly accounts before we watched the Royal wedding. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I found that the petrol smell around the TC was seepage from the sender unit! It seemed to be the bolts that were letting petrol out. So I removed the spare wheel holder and drained the tank. Then I removed the sender unit and started cleaning it.</p>
