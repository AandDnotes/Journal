        <h1>Friday 28th September</h1>
        <p>Today was 'MacMillan Coffee Morning' day, so I took Angela to the church with her cakes, etc. and then took the Panda to Simms for its service and MOT. I then walked back to the church and helped set up. We had a viewing at ten, so I had coffee before walking home. In practice I only had an hour before I needed to return to the church to help take things down and tidy up. By that time the sun had come out and it was quite warm.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela went to Steyning and to Rosemary Avenue while I tried phoning Julie at the IET and finished tightening the clamp around the exhaust pipe and manifold. I also cleaned up the water connection to the head, ready to fit it. But then I had to walk down to the garage to collect the Panda. It is old enough to need a new timing belt (and water pump), so the bill was high!</p>
