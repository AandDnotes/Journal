        <h1>Tuesday 12th September</h1>
        <p>I started today by replying to the Sussex CoC, commenting on the COE's concerns, and then started collecting together photos for the September IET newsletter. We were waiting for Ben from the estate agents who arrived at eleven to make notes and take photos. The EPC person was not due until Monday, but later phoned to say they had a cancellation for tomorrow afternoon.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the first table tennis session of the year and I continued working on the TC's head. I finished cleaning the head and then cleaned six of the eight valves.</p>
