        <h1>Sunday 9th September</h1>
        <p>A busy day leaving us feeling quite tired. While Angela was at church I put some emulsion on the spots on the front bedroom ceiling and put undercoat on the bottom o the garage doors. I also started drafting a reply to Alison Watson at the Sussex Chamber of Commerce. After lunch I cleaned the fascia boards along the side and rear of the garage, the latter needing me to climb the wall and sit on the shed roof. While doing this I spoke with both Terry and John and told them of the possibility of our move.</p>
        <p>We then spent the rest of the afternoon talking with Paul and with Victoria. Angela was making three pints of jelly at the same time and when we finished talking we made three lots of mouse for tomorrow's lunch club. So dinner was quite late.</p>
