        <h1>Saturday 29th September</h1>
        <p>It seems that Austin broke his arm yesterday. He fell from the climbing frame at school and fractured his right arm just above the wrist. He has a long plaster, starting above his elbow, since the doctor was afraid that, due to his thin arms, the plaster would slip off. Consequently Angela bought him a book and Mr Bump card and we walked down to Steyning to post it. We also bought a newspaper.</p>
        <p>When we got home I did the weekly accounts and later in the morning started fitting the water connections at the front of the TC's engine. One of the jubilee clips would not tighten, so I went to Halfords in Shoreham to buy a new one. I then started looking at the carburetters.</p>
