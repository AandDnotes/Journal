        <h1>Monday 24th September</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Monday we started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. From there we went to Sainsbury's to buy a little food, returning home after this morning's viewing of the house. According to Ben, the couple were looking for a bungalow for later life,to be rented out until then.</p>
        <p>After lunch I fitted three of the valves on the TC's head before getting ready to go to Crawley for three meetings. I met Greg (Bernard returned from the US with a cold) to talk about the business event. Then we had the IET committee meeting and finally I talked with Ramon and Gavin about the way forward with the SLO role.</p>
