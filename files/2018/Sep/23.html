        <h1>Sunday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church, in the rain, I did backups and updates and made notes for Monday's IET committee meeting. Then I went into the garage. I had intended refitting the valves, but realised that there was part of the head that I'd not painted and will be visible. So I gave that area two coats of red paint. Then I cleaned the exhaust and inlet manifolds (and 'clips') and sprayed them with aluminium paint.</p>
        <p>The rain stopped at about two o'clock and the sun came out. However, it was still raining in Rotterdam, so we spoke with Paul. A little later we spoke with Victoria.</p>
