        <h1>Friday 21st September</h1>
        <p>This morning we went to Rosemary Avenue to pick up some things for the charity shop, which we took into Steyning. While there we called into the antique shop to see if they might be interested in some of the furniture/artifacts. Ed gave us a card for someone who might be interested in them. After going to the bank and the butcher we returned to rosemary Avenue and spent time in the courtyard, taking trees out of pots.</p>
        <p>After lunch I gave a first coat of paint to the other side of the head and the off-side of the block. I also started cleaning up the inlet and exhaust manifolds. The latter is quite rusty, so I mixed up some rust converter and left the exhaust manifold partly submerged. I will need to turn it over tomorrow and apply another coat of paint to the head and block. For both I used a brush, spraying point firstly into t small plastic lid.</p>
        <p>We also had a call from Ben, the estate agent, to arrange a viewing for tomorrow. This morning's viewing had been cancelled by the viewers. I also checked on our ability to buy Penlands Vale without selling our house first. I would be April before we had access to enough money.</p>
