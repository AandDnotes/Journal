        <h1>Friday 7th September</h1>
        <p>I'm feeling somewhat shell-shocked. Today we made an offer on a house! This afternoon we revisited 31 Penlands Vale, armed with a list of things to check. We were met their by the manager of the local estate agents office (one of five in Steyning), named Benjamin Frankling (with a g on the end). At the end of our inspection we offered the asking price and arranged for him to visit us on Monday with a view to putting our house on the market. Angela said that the children will be surprised. I replied that I am surprised.</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to the bank, the dentist and the church, I started organising some IET things and had a look around at the houses advertised for sale in Steyning and Henfield. Then, after an early lunch, we went to Holmebush to do the weekly groceries shop and for Angela to buy things for Monday's lunch club.</p>
        <p>On our return from viewing the house I went into the garage and removed the rocker gear and push rods from the TC's engine. The next state is to actually try to remove the head.</p>
