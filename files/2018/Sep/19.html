        <h1>Wednesday 19th September</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went off to the health centre for a set of tests. She goes back next week for the results. When she got home I went off to collect the paint that I had ordered. I drove to Shoreham and caught the 700 along to Hove, walking up from the coast to Portland Road. I was home just after midday and found that my gaskets had arrived.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I sent a 'test' newsletter to Greg for review and then went into the garage. I masked the bypass pipe and thermostat housing and spray painted them with the red paint that I bought on Monday. I then masked one side of the head and spray painted the spark plug side and rear of the head, brushing over the paint to spread out the runs and pools and paint areas that the spray could not reach. I will give it a second coat before moving on to the other sides.</p>
