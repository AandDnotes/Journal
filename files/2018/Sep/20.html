        <h1>Thursday 20th September</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday we started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. From there we went to Morrisons to get some plants (and have coffee) and then on to Sainsbury's to do the weekly food shop. Over lunch the estate agent called to tell us of another viewing (a week tomorrow) and talk about options for buying the house in Penlands Vale before selling our house.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to Rosemary Avenue to sort out more stuff and I went to Moulescoomb to a GOG meeting. When I got home I modified the newsletter and submitted it for approval.</p>
