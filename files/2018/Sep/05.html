        <h1>Wednesday 5th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI group I looked at the IET policies, did the GDPR training and emailed the committee about reading the policies. I then went into the garage and removed the remaining two nuts holding the exhaust to the manifold. To reach the back nut I had to remove the off-side wheel and approach the nut from below. After lunch I removed the inlet and exhaust manifolds and then drained the coolant.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we walked down to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Finding Your Feet'. We met Mel and Fife there and also Jim and Marilyn. It was a very good film.</p>
