        <h1>Tuesday 25th September</h1>
        <p>Our expected house viewer cancelled (but hopes to come next week), so the day was our own. Angela has not been too well, having a bout of colic. However, she slept well and has felt quite a bit better today. This morning she walked down to Steyning to buy some meat while I finished fitting the valves in the head. After lunch I cut the front and rear grass while Angela did some tidying of the greenhouse and a shed. I also researched torque values for the head nuts and devised my plan/strategy.</p>
