        <h1>Saturday 15th September</h1>
        <p>We started by collecting some rubbish from Rosemary Avenue and taking it to the tip in Shoreham. We then went on to the Mayberry garden centre for coffee and for me to go to Speedy Spares, but they are closed on Saturday and Sunday! When we got home, Angela went back to Rosemary Avenue and I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela shredded the garden waste that she had brought home and I de-greased the areas of the TC's head that need to be painted. I also cleaned up the off-side of the block and coated the base of the oil can holder with some black Hammerite.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we walked down to the Steyning Centre for an excellent concert by a pianist called Martin James Bartlett. He was pretty good and played a good programme.</p>
