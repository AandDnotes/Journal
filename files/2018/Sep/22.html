        <h1>Saturday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We started by walking to the Beeding newsagents to buy a paper. When we got home I gave the manifold side of the engine head and block another coat of paint. We then went to Rosemary Avenue while the estate agent gave two viewings of our house. We emptied more pots in the courtyard and took the waste plants to the tip in Shoreham, getting home for a late lunch.</p>
        <p>While eating lunch we had a call from Ben about the two viewings. He had spoken to both people. The first is a builder who was looking at our house for a friend. However, he is also interested in it and would like to organise a second viewing, but with his friend. The second viewing was by a woman whose boyfriend had already sold a flat in Manchester. She was interested and wants to arrange a second viewing with her boyfriend. We also have another viewing on Monday morning. Ben is very positive.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was a case of catching up with things. I did the weekly accounts and sent an email to Jeremy Watson about his talk. I also bought travel insurance for our trip to California at Christmas.</p>
