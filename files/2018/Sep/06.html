        <h1>Thursday 6th September</h1>
        <p>We started the day with a relatively early visit to Victoria Grand. However, we still managed to miss coffee! Back at home we pottered until an early lunch and then walked to Penlands Vale to look at number 31. It was better than we thought. In fact its only negative points are that it is a conventional house (similar to many others in the neighbourhood) and it is on what is essentially a large housing estate. After some debate we organised a second viewing.</p>
        <p>I then returned to the garage and removed the thermostat housing (and found no thermostat) and loosened the vent pipe and chest cover. The next stage is to remove the rocker bar.</p>
