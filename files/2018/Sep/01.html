        <h1>Saturday 1st September</h1>
        <p>A warm day with unbroken sunshine. We started, perhaps a little late, with a walk to the Beeding newsagents to buy a paper. After that Angela spent most of the day in the garden, while I spent the morning doing the weekly and monthly accounts. After lunch I put the chairs and wellies in the TC ready for tomorrow and posted an entry on the Sussex IET blog about the Volks railway. Then I made a start on summer pruning the large apple tree. Finishing it requires some serious climbing!</p>
