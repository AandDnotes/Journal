        <h1>Sunday 16th September</h1>
        <p>We were up a little later this morning after a very late night. When we got back from the concert we discovered that we hadn't put the bread maker on. It was filled with ingredients, but not turned on. So we had to wait up until 1:30 in the morning for it to finish!</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did up dates (Windows took most of the morning) and backups and then went into the garage. I removed the side panel, but firstly had to take out the distributor. Two of the cam followers have some pitting, but the rest look fine. I cleaned up and de-greased the panel and did the same for the top of the block. I also removed the bypass pipe so that it will be easier to paint and so that I can take it as an example of the paint colour.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke to Rowan, who had just got out of the bath, and to Austin and Juniper while they were having their breakfast.</p>
