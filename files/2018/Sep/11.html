        <h1>Tuesday 11th September</h1>
        <p>I started by giving the grass, front and back, a quick trim while Angela held her WI committee meeting in the dining room. I then went into the garage, finished removing the valves from the TC's head and started cleaning the combustion chambers. I found that the inlet valve of the fourth cylinder not only had a completely different oil seal, but it was also broken. This certainly explains the oil in that cylinder.</p>
        <p>After lunch I drove to Hamish's and then went on to the Bognor campus of Chichester University. We had a quick tour of the new building and talked about things that we could do together.</p>
