        <h1>Tuesday 18th September</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela caught the bus to Storrington to tke her WI cash to the bank while I read the Brighton GOG documents. I then went into the garage and cleaned up and de-greased the thermostat housing and bypass pipe.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to Field Place, to the RCEA meeting. It was the AGM, which was short, followed by a talk on steam traction engine ploughing. On the way home I collected the new door key from Timpson.</p>
        <p>When I got home I completed the September newsletter and asked Greg if I could send him a test version for review. While we were busy doing things, the 'for sale' board appeared on our front!</p>
