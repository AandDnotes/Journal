        <h1>Sunday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>We set off this morning at 7:35 in the TC and drove to Whiteways to help set up for the start of the South Downs Run and then to marshal. Our plate was number 3, implying only to older cars in the run. However, a late entry was also older. Ours was the only TC. We left at 10:30, had to turn around twice not far from the start, stopped for coffee at the Castle Hotel in Bramber and arrived at the Western Lawns in Eastbourne at about two o'clock. We discovered that Jim and Marilyn from around the corner have an MGB. We had lunch on the promenade, bought an ice cream and briefly walked around the cars. Then we took the more direct route home along the sea front, through Newhaven and Brighton, leaving at a quarter to four and arriving home at 5:15 after a total of 136 miles. The TC ran quite well, but mis-fired when I started it up to put it in the garage! However, it was a warm, sunny day with not a cloud in the sky and light winds. At Eastbourne people were swimming in the sea. Needless to say we were very tired by the time we got home.</p>
