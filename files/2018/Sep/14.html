        <h1>Friday 14th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning and on to Rosemary Avenue, I finished reading the IET mandatory policies for volunteers and updated the executor account spreadsheet. Ben sent his revised brochure for the house, so I checked it, as did Angela when she got back.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went back to Rosemary avenue to do more tidying in the garden and I worked on the TC's engine. I finished grinding the valves and scraped the red paint off the head, preparing it for de-greasing.</p>
