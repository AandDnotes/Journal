        <h1>Saturday 8th September</h1>
        <p>After our momentous actions yesterday it was quite hard to sleep last night. After breakfast we sorted out some things for the tip and went around to Rosemary Avenue to collect some things from there too before heading for the tip at Shoreham. We also delivered some blankets and towels to the Dogs Trust. When we got home Angela tidied up the front garden and I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela continued in the garden and I removed the head from the TC's engine. It came off easier than I thought and generally looks in better condition than I expected. However, I still need to remove the valves so as to inspect the seats. The fourth cylinder was oily as expected. Also, a quick inspection of the rocker gear showed no signs of wear. I was surprised at the gap between the pistons and the cylinder bore, although the rings fill the gap. I could get a 7 thou feeler gauge between the piston and the cylinder wall, meaning that the piston is about 15 thou smaller than the bore. However, it sounds as though this may be on the low side. I also measured the bore at 2.635". The 'standard' bore is 2.181", so the block has had a rebore at some time. However, the inside of the cylinders show no sign of scoring. I need to find an old piston ring so as to measure any wear in the bore.</p>
