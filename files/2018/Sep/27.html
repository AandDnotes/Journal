        <h1>Thursday 27th September</h1>
        <p>A relatively traditional Thursday. Although it started chilly, it was sunny and soon warmed up, to the point of being quite hot. We started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and from there went to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop. While we were out someone came back for a second viewing of the house. The agent said they are very interested but did not think that they could afford the asking price.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cooked more cakes for tomorrow's coffee morning while I cleared out the Panda in preparation for its service tomorrow and then worked on the TC. I discovered why there were two manifold gaskets in the head set. One is a few millimeters longer than the other and so only one, the smaller, would fit over the studs. After a little 'cleaning' of the studs and indentation on the exhaust manifold I managed to fit both manifolds, only to discover that I could not then get the exhaust pipe gasket over the studs, the pipe was in the way. So I took the manifolds off again. I found that the exhaust pipe does not meet the manifold at the correct angle, but I'm hoping that the nuts will pull it into line.</p>
