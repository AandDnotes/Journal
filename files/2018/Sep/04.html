        <h1>Tuesday 4th September</h1>
        <p>We had to get up early this morning since we were expecting a boiler service person at some time between 8am and 1pm. Luckily he arrived at about 8:30. As often happens, Angela walked down to Steyning to go to the butcher. Shortly before lunch I started work on the TC. After removing the bonnet I disconnected the linkages and fuel line from the carburetters and removed them. Getting the nuts off the exhaust flange was another matter. One came off, but the other two are hardly accessible and tight! So I squirted them with GT40 and left them until the morning. After lunch I finished cutting the rear grass before going back in the garage. We also arranged to view a house in Penlands Vale on Thursday.</p>
