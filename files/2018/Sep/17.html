        <h1>Monday 17th September</h1>
        <p>It seems to have been a busy day and was mainly sunny and hot. While I went off this morning to Victoria Grand to visit Dad, Angela walked to Steyning and did housework. I went on from West Worthing to Portslade to Speedy Spares. I'd hoped to get a piston ring and some engine paint, but they couldn't help with either. So all I bought was antifreeze. I went on to Halfords in Shoreham, but their 'red' engine paint was far too orange, although I did my a spray can of aluminium high temperature paint.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I walked down to Steyning to take a key to the agent (our first viewing is scheduled for Friday) and had a haircut. I then drove to Hove to get a new bolt for the mower and to visit the paint shop (which is opposite the bolt shop). I bought a can of red spray paint. I might be too bright and I originally wanted some brush-on paint, but I think that I can mask the areas. I also ordered a litre of synthetic paint that I can brush on to the underside of the wings and on to the firewall. Apparently synthetic paint will cover cellulose (but not the other way around) and is easier than cellulose to apply by brush. I can collect it after tomorrow lunch-time.</p>
        <p>In between these trips out I started work on the September IET newsletter. When I got home from Hove, Angela was already counting the cash from her meeting.</p>
