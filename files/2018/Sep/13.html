        <h1>Thursday 13th September</h1>
        <p>A day of three parts. This morning we went to Victoria Grand to see Dad, arriving early enough to get a cup of coffee. From there we went on to Sainsbury's to do some food shopping. I also ordered a new door key from Timpsons. Because they are 'security' locks the keys can only be ordered, at a cost of Â£32!</p>
        <p>After lunch the EPC assessor (and her mother) called to take photos and measure up. They will also produce a floor plan. I forgot to ask them if they had produced the one for Penlands Vale, where there is no marked way of getting into the bedrooms or bathroom! We also reviewed Ben's brochure and sent him our comments. I also took a photo of the front of the house that we thought provided a more attractive view than the one he had taken. I should have gone the whole hog and moved the car before I took it. Ben called around late in the day to take a photo from the same angle.</p>
        <p>I finished cleaning the valves of the TC's engine and experimented with grinding one valve. I also made measurements of the head depth and the cylinder bores. It looks as though the head has not been skimmed and the valves are the standard side. The bores, however, have been enlarged and according to Sherrill they are of a size that should have sleeves in them.</p>
