        <h1>Sunday 30th September</h1>
        <p>It was harvest festival at the Methodist Church this morning, so Angela went off with cake and fruit salad for the lunch they had planned. Meanwhile I went into the garage. I dismantled the carburetters, at least, removing the pistons and the float chambers and discovered that there are no piston springs! This may be the reason why the engine is very 'jittery' in low gear over a bumpy road. It may not be just down to my foot. All the bits were then cleaned in petrol. During the process I discovered that the needle valve in one float chamber had been inserted upside down and the lever bent to get the right fuel level. So I bent it back, using a dowel (wooden spoon handle) of 11 mm diameter to set it. After re-assembly I fitted the two carbs to the inlet manifold and started connecting the linkages.</p>
        <p>Work on the TC was interrupted firstly by a talk with Paul et al and then by Victoria. In the Netherlands they had visited Greet and Wim at a holiday chalet and gone to a safari park. Juniper had just returned from her swimming lesson and Austin showed us the orange plaster cast on his arm.</p>
