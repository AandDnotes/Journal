        <h1>Monday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>We slept well after our excursions yesterday. We started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad, showing him photos of the South Downs Run that I had downloaded earlier in the morning. We then went into Worthing to get some prints of photos and to try to find some house plant compost. We couldn't find the latter, but I did buy some LED bulbs to replace yet another broken one in the kitchen. After that we went to Sainsbury's for a few items of food (and drink) and tried B&amp;Q for compost. No luck again. So after lunch Angela went to Squires while I started cutting the grass. I cut the front before we spoke with Victoria (it is a holiday in the US today) and did half the back grass before dinner.</p>
