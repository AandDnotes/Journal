        <h1>Wednesday 26th September</h1>
        <p>Today I had nothing organised until the evening, although Angela had to see the nurse about her test results and, after lunch, went to play table tennis. It seems that her blood cholesterol level is high and so she needs to adjust her diet. No more cakes and biscuits!</p>
        <p>After reviewing and editing the minutes from last night's meeting I went into the garage. I cleaned the tops of the pistons with a plastic scraper and petrol on a rag and then fitted the head. It torqued to the full 50 lb.ft quite easily. I then inserted the push rods (in the same locations from which I removed them), bolted on the rocker gear and adjusted the tappets. They will need doing again when the engine is hot and after I have tightened the head nuts. I also fitted the side plate and breather tube and touched up a little of the red paint. When Angela got back from table tennis she baked cakes for Friday's coffee morning.</p>
        <p>In the evening I went to the Langshott Manor hotel to meet up with the team from work. Irvine is retiring and so senior members of his team came together for a week of meetings. Mark also attended, although he starts his new job on Monday. There was Steve Gray, who is taking over from Irvine, the ex engineering manager from Houston who is taking over from Steve, Pete Carrol, Ian Talmadge and Stephen Fineran from the UK and Marcello Alesso from Buenos Aires, who joined the team a year ago. There was also the leader of Ian's team in Chennai, Barbara from FoxMass, someone from Cairo and someone from Brazil. Irvine (irvine@mail.de) was quite concerned that he had not yet worked out what he was going to do when he retires in two weeks time. It was a good meal and a pleasant evening, even if it was after midnight when I got home.</p>
