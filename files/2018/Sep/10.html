        <h1>Monday 10th September</h1>
        <p>We started by taking the food (and bowls of mouse) down to the church hall. I then emailed Greg about the reply from the Sussex CoC, put some gloss paint on the bottom edge of the garage doors, had a shower and went to Victoria Grand to spend a short while with Dad. When I got home I did a little tidying before having lunch.</p>
        <p>Angela arrived home just as the estate agent arrived to inspect the house and suggest a valuation. He seemed surprised at the size and condition of the house and started with a valuation of £699,950. After some discussion we settled on £675,000.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I spent a little time in the garage, removing three of the eight valves, before going to the WSMGOC meeting in West Chiltington, starting with a meal.</p>
