        <h1>Monday 25th June</h1>
        <p>We visited Dad at Victoria Grand before going to Sainsbury's for coffee and to do some grocery shopping. After lunch I booked our Eurostar tickets and parking at Ebbsfleet. I also completed my new Odd & Ends web page for TC4985. I now need to integrate it into the rest of the site. Later in the afternoon I drove to Crawley for an IET Sussex committee meeting, getting home at about 10:15.</p>
