        <h1>Monday 18th June</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went down to Steyning, I took a trip to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. His arm was better after his fall last week, but he had a bruise under his eye, although he didn't remember how he'd got it. I left the incorrect contracts with Julie. She said that she would get them ammended. On the way home I called into Argos to get Dad a new watch. His had stopped working. It is probably the battery, but he thought he was due a new one. So we looked on the Argos web site and he chose one. Angela went to WI meeting after lunch and I mainly sat, but also tried to change our Virgin ISAs to the new, higher rate, but failed. But I did get Southern Water to send us a new bill for Rosemary Avenue, rather than an estimated one.</p>
