        <h1>Sunday 24th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I did the weekly accounts, having not done it yesterday. I also noticed that someone in in Shoreham was offering a car seat. It turned out to be Bernard's wife! So I went down to collect it. Although we thought that it would be suitable for Juniper, talking to Victoria it seems that it is more suited to Austin. I also did some work on the TC's web site. We later talked with Paul and then Victoria.</p>
