        <h1>Saturday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>Angela went to Beeding to buy a paper while I did the weekly accounts. We then took the MG to Knepp Castle, to the Flower Fringe Fair. Because we were in a classic car we could park near the house and get in at a reduced rate. It was a fine day. We bought some food and sat overlooking the lake to have our lunch. we also went into the garden. We were back about 3:30.</p>
