        <h1>Wednesday 6th June</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went walking with her WI friends, I took the bus to Brighton to exchange the bread maker. After lunch I removed the fron brake drums on the TC. The slave cylinders seem to be slightly moist, but not leaking. After an early dinner Angela went to the church to set up for the Festival event there. I waited for Mike Wooldridge to collect the IET equipment for a STEM event. He was also going to the talk about the ExoMars project, so we walked down together. It was an interesting talk by Andrew Coates from the Mullard Space Lab. He also gave an update on the analysis of the data from the Rosetta comet rendevue mission.</p>
