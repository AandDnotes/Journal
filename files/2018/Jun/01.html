        <h1>Friday 1st June</h1>
        <p>It was quite a good day, in spite of it being my 70th birthday. After sending a couple of IET email I looked for the petrol smell on the TC. I found that the float chamber on the forward carburettor was loose (but didn't seem to be leaking), but the hose to that carburettor had a small leak. I also made a new gromet to go in the bulkhead around the speedo cable. We then went to the Jungle Tea Room at the Big Plant nursery near Ashington for lunch. It was a good lunch and an interesting place. When we got home Angela went in the garden and after the window cleaners had been I cut the front and rear grass.</p>
