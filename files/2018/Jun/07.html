        <h1>Thursday 7th June</h1>
        <p>As usual we started by going to Victoria Grand to see Dad. From there we went to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I started working though the files for the Energy Watch workshop, which is now planned for Tuesday next week. After an early dinner we walked to St Andrews for a Steyning Festival event on 'the science of music'. It was very well attended and very good, even if some of the performances were a bit suspect.</p>
