        <h1>Sunday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>It was a hot and sunny day, but I didn't seem to achieve a great deal. I cleaned the facias and gutters on the end, but it was too hot to work on the back. So I left that until later, but only got a small part done. So this morning I did the monthly accounts, the shares spreadsheet taking a while to update. After lunch I also finished adding 2017 to the 'year notes' web page. Later we spoke with Paul and Rowan and then with Victoria, Austin and Juniper.</p>
