        <h1>Saturday 16th June</h1>
        <p>Last night my tickling throat turned into a full-blown cold. So I didn't have a good night. We started by going to Rosemary Avenue to read the water meter and pick a bag of clothes. We took that bag, plus one from home, to Penfold hall for a jumble sale and then bought a newspaper. The rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and reconciling two sets of statements. Meanwhile Angela did more shredding, after I had rewired the plug on the extention lead. Victoria emailed to say that she had bought their flight tickets, but after lunch I basically did nothing.</p>
