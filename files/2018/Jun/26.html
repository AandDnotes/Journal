        <h1>Tuesday 26th June</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela's ear was hurting, so she made an appointment to see the doctor (actually the paramedic). He gave her some ear drops, but the pharacist couldn't understand the prescription and it had to be taken back. All this meant that we didn't leave for Arundel until midday. I had taken the TC to get some petrol and then met Angela at the surgery. However, we arrived at the Black Rabbit at about 12:40, just before the rest of the WSMGOC on the pub run were served their food. So we had a good lunch and were home at 3:30. The TC was not running well. It would not idle properly and seemed to be pinking when going downhill. So I checked the points (and found quite a lot of oil in the distributor cap), adjusted the ignition timing (leaving it more or less where it had been), made the mixture one flat leaner and adjusted the idle speed. I then took it for my usual test run. Overall I drove the car 47 miles. When we got home Angela made two summer puddings.</p>
