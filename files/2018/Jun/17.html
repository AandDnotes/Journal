        <h1>Sunday 17th June</h1>
        <p>My cold was no better, so it was a somewhat dreary day. However, it was brightened by talking with Rowan and with Austin and Juniper this afternoon. Angela went to church this morning and I dealt with odds and ends, like renewing ISAs and updating web sites. I also did the weekly backups and updates.</p>
