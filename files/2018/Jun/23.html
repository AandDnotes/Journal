        <h1>Saturday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>A warm, mainly sunny day. We started as usual on a Saturday by walking to Beeding Bridge to buy a newspaper. The rest of the day was then mainly spent in the garden. I trimmed the bottom yew tree with the hedge trimmer before sawing/lopping the top growth. I then trimmed the box hedge in front of the compost area. Meanwhile Angela shredded a lot of what I had cut. I also wrote and sent a note to the Octogon Bulletin editor about removing oil scrolls from a back axle.</p>
