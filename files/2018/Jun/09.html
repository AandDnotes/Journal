        <h1>Saturday 9th June</h1>
        <p>We took our usual stoll to the Beeding Newsagent this morning. Then Angela worked in the garden and I did the weekly accounts. Then I started pruning the laurel bush at the top of the garden, After lunch Angela went back in the garden and I trimmed the front of the next bush so that it is easier to get through. I still heve the ends and top of these two bushes to prune. I then finished removing the brake cylinder from the rear near-side wheel. It was clear that, although the new piston seals are the right size, the boot rubbers are too small. Even after soaking one in brake fluid it would not stretch far enough, so I reused the old ones. I refitted the slave cylinder and bled the brakes, using a device that I bought when we had Doris!. I then reassembled the brakes, by which time dinner was ready.</p>
