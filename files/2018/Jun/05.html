        <h1>Tuesday 5th June</h1>
        <p>We started by going to the Mayberry garden centre and bought an new bird bath, an apron for Kate and a wallet for Dad. I also called into Speedy Spares to get a ring for the oil filter bowl. After lunch I removed the rear brake drums on the TC since the brakes had started squeeling. Apart from some brake shoe dust I found that the near-side slave cyclinder appears to be leaking. Later I went to Victoria Grand to attend their Family meeting.</p>
