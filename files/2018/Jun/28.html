        <h1>Thursday 28th June</h1>
        <p>Being Thursday it was shopping day. So we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then went into Worthing. There we bought a tee-shirts for Austin and Juniper and looked at wellinton boots. We then went on to Sainsbury's for some more grocery shopping. This afternoon I went to the hygenist. Meanwhile, Angela did some cleaning and we tried removing dust from the filters in the vacuum cleaner. Afterwards I uploaded my changes to the TC's web site.</p>
