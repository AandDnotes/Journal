        <h1>Wednesday 27th May</h1>
        <p>Hamish collected me at 6:30, along with the equipment, and drove to Ardingly for the Big Bang SE. We unloaded and started seting up the IET stand before I went off to the judges briefing. I then spent the morning inspecting the Junior Engineering projects (13 reduced to 8 by no-shows). As Moderator I was able to sway the result so that the project I thought the best won the stream. After a sandwich lunch I joined Hamish and Merlin on the IET stand. We packed up at three and I was home just after four. Angela had been out for her Table Tennis club lunch.</p>
