        <h1>Friday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning and Rosemary Avenue, I finished cutting the back grass. I then investigated the times and costs of Eurostar transport to Rotterdam. After lunch I investigated the carburettors on the TC. Firstly I cleaned the plugs (all still a bit black and the fourth very carbonised), then found a leak on the inlet banjo of the first, which tightening fixed. Then I checked that the fuel level in each carburettor was not too high. I then undid the link between the jets and tried to determine how many 'flats' the jets were from the fully up position. However, the rear one seemed to just carry on turning. I guess the whole jet was turning. The front jet was ten flats down. So I did the same on the rear and adjusted the slow running. I then took the car for the usual test run. It seemed to run well.</p>
