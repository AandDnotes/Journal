        <h1>Thursday 14th June</h1>
        <p>We started the day by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. We were early enough to get a cup of coffee! Before lunch Angela went to a WI skittles/pizza event. I started compiling this month's newsletter before going to the Mullard Space Centre, which was interesting.</p>
