        <h1>Thursday 21st June</h1>
        <p>The longest day, so the days now start getting shorter! We went off this morning to Victoria Grand to visit Dad, before going into Worthing to change Austin's shirt (and buy some more). We did quite a tour of children's clothes shops before going to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop. We were home just before 2:30, feeling quite weary. So after a late lunch I read this year's SRFC handbook, cleared email and experimented with Office 365; not very successfully.</p>
