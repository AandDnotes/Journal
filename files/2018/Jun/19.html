        <h1>Tuesday 19th June</h1>
        <p>Angela took her WI cash to Storrington on the bus this morning while I pottered (at the computer). The iMac said the mouse needed charging, which I did, but then it would not connect! Turning it on and off didn't help. I phoned Currys, but they wanted me to return the whole computer! So I phoned Apple support. After a while the suggested I turn Bluetooth off and then on. That fixed it. I then updated Mum and Dad's page on the family tree web site. Later in the afternoon I cut the front grass and half the back grass. I also made an appointment for Dad at the optician and put an entry on Steyning Freegle asking for a car seat and booster seat. I had a reply, but when I went round he could not find them!</p>
