        <h1>Wednesday 20th June</h1>
        <p>Today was the day for Angela's ear operation. We went into Worthing later in the morning and went to Debenhams to get Austin some shirts before we went to the hospital. Unfortunately I picked up the wrong size for one of them! So I left Angela at midday. She was expecting a general anesthetic, but was only give a local one. This made the whole process shorter and I got a call at about 3:30 to go and collect her.</p>
