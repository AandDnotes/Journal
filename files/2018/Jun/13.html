        <h1>Wednesday 13th June</h1>
        <p>Another good, but tiring day. I took the TC to get some petrol and then headed for the Spur pub at Slindon, where I met up with the Sussex Wanderers. We then all set off to Singleton. I started following an MMM, but lost him at one of the early turns. I navigagted myslef for a while until an MGB came along and I followed them. Overall I did 79 miles. After lunch, Angela went to do the weekly shop since she is out tomorrow, getting home just after me. This afternoon Angela got a call from Worthing hospital about an appointment next Wednesday to have her ear operation.</p>
