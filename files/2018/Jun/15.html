        <h1>Friday 15th June</h1>
        <p>A warm, sunny and calm day. Angela went to Steyning and to Rosemary Avenue while I completed my June IEt newsletter. Although I wasted a lot of time trying to downoad photos from my iPhone. I coudn't even delete photos on the phone. So I had to use a photo of MSSL from thier web site. I also took my own photo of the Energy Watch equipment since I've not received any from Laura. Later in teh afternoon I reduced the height of the lilac bush at the bottom of the garden. Angela started shedding it.</p>
