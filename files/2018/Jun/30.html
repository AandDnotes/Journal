        <h1>Saturday 30th June</h1>
        <p>The end of June already! Angela went off this morning alittle after 11 to Petworth House to meet her school friends, getting home just after six. Before she left I walked to the Beeding newsagents, then to the petrol station and then to Hyde Square to buy a paper. Before lunch I trimmed the large box bush. It was getting too hot by then, so I spent the early afternoon replying to IET email and doing the weekly accounts. Later in the afternoon I trimmed the yew bush next to the box and started removing its 'topnot'. I started clearing up just before Angela got home. After dinner I installed the latest version of Flash and cleared the browser cache (as suggested by All 4) in the hope that I could then get the end of Humans to run beyond the ads. It worked, but a Mac cleaner tool was also installed. So I removed it.</p>
