        <h1>Sunday 10th June</h1>
        <p>This morning I posted a blog entry about old and new technology in Sussex on the Sussex LN web site. I also did the usual updates and backups while Angela was at church. I also worked on the TC. Unfortunately, when I pressed the brake pedel, brake fluid sprayed out! After repeated attempts at connecting the banjo to the back of the cylinder I got it down to a smear. We then spoke with Victoria and then with Paul.</p>
