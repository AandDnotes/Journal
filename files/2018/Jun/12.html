        <h1>Tuesday 12th June</h1>
        <p>A good, but tiring day. Mike picked me up at 7:30 and we went to Lancing Prep in Hove to run the Energy Watch workshop. Meanwhile Angela caught the bus into Worthing. The workshop went reasonably well and I was home at about 2:30. Later I took the rear near-side hub off the TC to check the brake cylinder after yesterday evenings run to West Chiltington. Luckily all was well, so I checked over the car in preparation for tomorrow's Sussex Wanderers run.</p>
