        <h1>Friday 29th June</h1>
        <p>Angela spent most of the day out, going to Rosemary Avenue and Steyning before lunch, to have her hair cut just after lunch and then to a 'messy church' session later. My only trip outside was to put Roundup on the weeds in the gutter. Otherwise I wrote IET emails, updated the volunteers list on the web site, wrote a letter to Austin, scanned it in and sent it. I also collected together a number of IET briefing documents.</p>
