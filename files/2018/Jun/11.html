        <h1>Monday 11th June</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. When I got home I went through the slides for tomorrow's workshop. After lunch Angela had her WI committee meeting in the dining room and I lent on the spanner a little more and seemed to stop the slight leak from the banjo. I then did a couple of IET tasks (award nomination and distributionof the budget guidelines) before dinner. Afterwards I took the TC, on my own, to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington.</p>
