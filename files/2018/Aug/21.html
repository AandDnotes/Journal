        <h1>Tuesday 21st August</h1>
        <p>While Victoria and the children were still sorting themselves out, Angela went to the butchers while I downloaded photos and put them on the iPad. We then went to visit Dad. His left wrist was swollen and he was waiting for a visit from the doctor. We went on to do some shopping before returning home for an early lunch. Afterwards we went to Washbrook farm park, spending most of the afternoon there. Although we were home relatively early, they were very late to bed.</p>
