        <h1>Wednesday 1st August</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to walk with her WI group while I drafted notes of our meeting on the business event. Then I went to see the doctor about my reduced urine flow rate. Looks OK, but I need to have a blood test. After lunch we took a car load of rubbish to the tip. Then after an early dinner we went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Darkest Hour'.</p>
