        <h1>Monday 27th August</h1>
        <p>Bank holiday Monday and the day that Victoria et al fly home. The early morning was a little manic, but we were able to leave at 9:20 and dropped them off at Gatwick at 10:15. They could check-in from 9:30, with their flight at about 1:30.</p>
        <p>On our way home we stopped at Nymans for a coffee and were home at about 11:45. I showered and Angela started clearing up the 'mess' that three weeks of grandchildren leave behind them. After lunch Angela did some 'theraputic' gardening and I tried a few things with Brandon's AirPort. I can get it to work with the ADSL modem also doing the routing (DHCP server), but the AirPort doing the Wi-Fi.</p>
