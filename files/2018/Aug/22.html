        <h1>Wednesday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>Before anyone else was ready, Angela was walking down to the butcher's. She then cooked a pasta sauce for use later. After an early lunch we went back to the South Downs Light Railway and had our two trips on the steam train (the locomotive was a tank engine called Pulborough). When we got home and while Angela was cooking, we walked around the corner and over the style into the field in search of blackberries. Juniper had picked a few over our fence in the morning. Although the day was a little more gentle than others have been, we are still very tired (not helped by my cold and cough).</p>
