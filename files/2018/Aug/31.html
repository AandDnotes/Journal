        <h1>Friday 31st August</h1>
        <p>It took a while to get going this morning. However, this did mean that my oil filter was delivered before we left for Victoria Grand, getting there at about 10:20 to visit Dad. We then went into Worthing. After coffee we looked for boxer shorts (too expensive or wrong style) and asked Barclays if they had any information about accounts for overseas grandchildren. They did not. We stopped at Morrisons on the way home for a couple of items of food.</p>
        <p>After lunch we looked at the feasibility of visiting Sally before going on to Kate's, but it would not work. Angela then wrote letters to 'beneficiaries' and I fitted the oil filter, lowered the TC to the ground and filled the engine with oil. Then I checked the gearbox oil level and tyre pressures before going for a test run and buying petrol in preparation for Sunday's South Downs Run.</p>
