        <h1>Friday 10th August</h1>
        <p>There was lots of noise during the night from Austin and Juniper, so our sleep was quite disturbed. In fact Victoria didn't get much sleep, so after breakfast she and Juniper went back to bed until about eleven. Meanwhile, we played with Austin, mainly with Lego.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we went off to the Mayberry garden centre to look for a rain jacket for Austin and Speedy spares to buy oil and fuel additive. We then went on to Tesco to get a jacket and some food. Austin needed to use his new jacket on the way out since it was raining heavily. In fact, the rain was torrential on the way home. Angela then took the car down to Steyning to go to the butcher and we did a lot more play.</p>
