        <h1>Friday 24th August</h1>
        <p>Victoria had agreed to edit a document, even though she was on holiday. However, the society producing the document were late in delivering it, but it was expected early today. So after a late breakfast we took Austin and Juniper to Shoreham to catch the bus into Worthing. it was an event going upstairs on a double-decker bus. We walked down the pier and lunch in the cafe. They are not at all child friendly, have a very limited lunch menu (only three varieties of panini, plus cakes). We then explored the beach and walked along the promenade to the playground they had visited yesterday. After an hour there we caught the bus back to Shoreham and were home just before four. Victoria had just received the document. So we entertained the children, including bathing both (at different times) and providing dinner (pizza from dough that had been made this morning). After quiet stories it was then the usual chaos as they got ready for bed!</p>
