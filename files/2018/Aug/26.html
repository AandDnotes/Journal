        <h1>Sunday 26th August</h1>
        <p>In spite of their busy day yesterday on their trip to London, they were up before us. So we all had breakfast together. Then Victoria set herself up in the study to do some work, Angela went to church and I 'entertained' the children. Or was it the other way round? It started raining quite early, so we couldn't get out into the garden to play. However, I managed to survive until lunch time, so at least there were two of us during the afternoon. We spoke to Paul and Rowan briefly and after dinner, gave Austin and Juniper a bath, read them stories and sang songs while Victoria did some more work. At 8:30 they went off to make their bed and pack their cases! As usual they became more boisterous as time went on.</p>
