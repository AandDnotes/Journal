        <h1>Sunday 12th August</h1>
        <p>It rained on and off the whole day, with a particularly heavy spell late in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church the rest of us went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. Austin took of photos nearly everything in the room! We were late-ish arriving and so left as they were assembling for lunch. We then went down to the promenade and went on to the beach, even though it was trying to rain. We had our waterproof jackets, so Austin and Juniper collected stones and shells and Austin took photos of the waves. We only stayed a few minutes before setting off home.</p>
        <p>After lunch we played games and spoke with Rowan. Then we downloaded Austin's photos, printing another six.</p>
