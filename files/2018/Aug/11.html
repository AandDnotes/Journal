        <h1>Saturday 11th August</h1>
        <p>The grandchildren did not get up until 11 o'clock! Angela, Victoria and the children went to Steyning this morning, calling in to the park. We had a late lunch in the garden. Afterwards we played games and Austin help make a scrapbook and cut out photos. I spent a lot of time trying to download photos from my iPhone. I could not even delete photos. Finally I found that I could do a forced reset (without deleting anything) by holding the home and power/sleep buttons down together for 10 seconds. Then all was fine. The grandchildren did not get to bed until 9:30! We are exhausted.</p>
