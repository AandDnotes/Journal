        <h1>Thursday 9th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I wrote up some notes on our meeting on Tuesday with the Sussex Chamber of Commerce and sent them to Greg for review. Then I spoke with Julie Hudson about our business event and its budget. Later I sent out the notes and the suggestion from Julie that we only hold one business meeting this year so as to see how successful it is. We had an early lunch and I drove to Gatwick to meet Victoria, Austin and Juniper. They'd had a good, if long journey. Victoria had posted a photo of them on the train, in the airport and on the plane before they left. We fought with the parking ticket machine, but wre home by about two o'clock. After a while victoria and Juniper had a sleep, while Austin played with cars and lego. Later we played games, had dinner and gave them both a bath before they all went to bed.</p>
