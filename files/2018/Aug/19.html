        <h1>Sunday 19th August</h1>
        <p>A relatively quiet, but nevertheless tiring day. After pancakes for breakfast we spent the morning just having baths, showers and generally messing around. After lunch Paul, Angela and I took Flow for a walk and then I helped Krista peel apples from the garden for a crumble. Just before dinner they decided that they wanted to go to the playground, so Paul took Rowan and Austin in the box bike and Victoria had an electric bike with Juniper on the back. Surprisingly they were back in time for dinner (spaghetti carbonara), follwed by apple crumble and custard. After a game they all went off to bed, at least starting all in Rowand's room.</p>
