        <h1>Thursday 16th August</h1>
        <p>It rained for the best part of the day. So we all went to Vicroria Grand, not getting there particularly early, but in time to tell Dad what we had been doing, what we were about to do and show him some photos and give him time to get to lunch. On the way home we stopped at Lyons Farm to get a few items in Sainsbury's and top up the fuel in the Panda.</p>
        <p>After lunch Juniper and I had a nap while the others went down to the bookshop in Steyning to buy a present for Rowan. We then played games, giving them both a bath after dinner and started our packing for the morning.</p>
        <p>Another tiring day on top of my cold.</p>
