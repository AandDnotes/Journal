        <h1>Thursday 30th August</h1>
        <p>We were up fairly late and Angela went down to Steyning, while I spent most of the day in the garage, servicing the TC. I was expecting an oil filter to arrive today, but it did not. So I did everything other than fit the oil filter and fill the engine with oil. Having forgotten to take the library books with her on her first trip to Steyning, Angela went down again, but to the library.</p>
