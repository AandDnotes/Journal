        <h1>Monday 20th August</h1>
        <p>No one seemed in any hurry to get up and get ready this morning. However, we left Berkenvouder (in two cars) just after 10:30 and caught the metro from Cappelsebrug to Rotterdam. We decided to buy some sandwiches and other things in Albert Heinz in the station to take with us to eat on the train.</p>
        <p>The Thalys train from Amsterdam was on time today and so we reached Brussels in time to join the queue for the Eurostar. We left the car park at Ebbsfleet at four o'clock, were home at 5:30 and were eating dinner by 6:30.</p>
