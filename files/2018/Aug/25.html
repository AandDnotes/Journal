        <h1>Saturday 25th August</h1>
        <p>A quiet day, until the evening. I took Victoria, Austin and Juniper to Shoreham station, where they caught the train to London to meet Emily, Victoria's friend from UMIST.</p>
        <p>So, on my return, I did the weekly accounts and when Angela had returned from Steyning, we spent the rest of the morning in the garden. I cut the front grass and after lunch started cutting the back grass (I only managed about half).</p>
        <p>The train that they caught back from London arrived at Shoreham at six o'clock. So I met them at the station and we had dinner as soon as we got home. Afterwards should have been winding down to bed time, but it was a wind up to chaos!</p>
