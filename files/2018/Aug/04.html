        <h1>Saturday 4th August</h1>
        <p>Angela spent the morning helping at the coffee morning at the church while I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper and then did the weekly accounts and updated the executor account spreadsheet. I then spent some time investigating ways of building a journal. Otherwise it was reading the paper and helping Angela with her WI duties.</p>
