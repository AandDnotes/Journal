        <h1>Tuesday 28th August</h1>
        <p>I'd hoped for a bit o a lie-in this morning, our first for three weeks without Victoria et al, but Angela was up early putting on some washing. When that was hung out we went off to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then on to Lyons Farm to do some food shopping. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I cut the rest of the grass, followed by migrating a few of my journal files.</p>
