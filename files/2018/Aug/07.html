        <h1>Tuesday 7th August</h1>
        <p>This morning, following doing some washing, Angela went off to do food shopping, while I finished drafting an article for Main Gear and painting some samples of the TC's paint. After lunch I went to Burgess Hill to the Sussex Chamber of Commerce. Greg Hobbs joined me to discuss the proposed joint business events. When I got home we went round to Rosemary Avenue to read the meters and photograph some items.</p>
