        <h1>Monday 13th August</h1>
        <p>Angela was first out of the house this morning, heading to Steyning to get some food. I followed at 9:30 to walk down to the Health Centre. The others were awake, but not up. I saw a doctor about my blood test results. The PSA value was in the right range, red  and white blood cell counts were fine, kidney function and liver function were both fine and the urine sample that I had taken with me was also fine. The doctor gave me a sheet about prostate symptoms so that I could see if any change in the future.</p>
        <p>Angela went back down to the church before midday to help with the lunch club. We played in the garden, between showers, and set them up to do some painting.</p>
