        <h1>Thursday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>A quieter, but no less exhausting day. Everything started even later than usual. So after an early  lunch we went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. He was pleased to see the children again, for the last time before they go home.</p>
        <p>From there we drove into Worthing and parked near Splash Point, walking across the road to the children's playground. They spent quite some time there before we drove home. There was then the usual lack of interest in any food that requires chewing or anything that is thought to be 'hard'.</p>
        <p>Today Brandon was in St Louis, Missouri having an interview with Monsanto. Apparently it went well, but he lacks the managerial experience required for the role. He is staying there over the weekend to meet up with his parents who are driving cross-state to see him.</p>
