        <h1>Wednesday 29th August</h1>
        <p>To our surprise it rained, heavily at time, for a lot of the morning. Angela went off to join her WI walking friends, but they only went in for a coffee! Meanwhile I started servicing the TC. I drained the oil and removed the oil filter element. Unfortunately the new paper element is too long. So I phoned NTG and ordered a felt filter (like the old one) which will compress slightly if necessary. Otherwise I fitted new spark plugs, checked the points, greased the water pump and dynamo bearing and the added oil to the tacho reduction gears. Finally I put the car on axle stands so as to do the suspension greasing tomorrow.</p>
