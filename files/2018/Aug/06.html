        <h1>Monday 6th August</h1>
        <p>Today we had a belated anniversary outing. After I visited the health centre to have a blood sample taken and Angela did two sets of washing,  we visited Dad at Victoria Grand and then went on to Singleton (via the scenic route) to the Weald & Downland Museum. We arrived in time for lunch and then spent the afternoon walking around to the various buildings, starting by talking to one of the volunteer millers at teh water mill. We thought we had visited all the buildings, but on inspecting the guidebook we find that we missed a few Victorian houses. We were home before six o'clock.</p>
