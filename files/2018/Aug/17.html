        <h1>Friday 17th August</h1>
        <p>An exhausting day. I know that most of them of late have been exhausting, but today was particularly so. We were up reasonably early (for Austin and Juniper) and left for Ebsfleet at about twenty past ten. The journey (on main roads) was a bit slow in places, but we arrived at Ebsfleet by midday. We went through passport control and sat at a table to have our lunch, watching the trainis. Then it was the Eurostar to Brussels, followed by the Thalys to Rotterdam. We arrived just after six and Paul met us. We then took the Metro to Capelsebrug, where Krista and Greet met us. The children, although supposedly going to bed, are full of beans and we have given up!</p>
