        <h1>Tuesday 14th August</h1>
        <p>Austin and Juniper were up earlier than we had thought this morning, following their late night. At about 11:15 we left for Brighton Marina, taking quite a slow route along the coast. We parked on the roof of the multi-storey car park and had lunch in 'Frankie &amp; Benny's', which was not a good idea. The food was fine, but it took them a long time to do anything. Afterwards we walked to the Black Rock station on the Volks railway. A full train was just leaving, so we caught the next to the other end of the line. There we walked on teh beach, taking photos of the waves. Some people were in the water, playing in the waves. Our train from the Marina had open sides, with just chains across the door opening, whereas the train back had windows and sliding doors, which was much noisier. When we got back to the Marina, they all walked across to Asda while I went to the car and moved it down to the Asda car park (after an unplanned trip out of the Marina and back in). We then took the same route home. Juniper slept in the car and for quite a while when we got home. So she did not go to sleep until after 10:30!</p>
