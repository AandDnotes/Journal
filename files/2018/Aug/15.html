        <h1>Wednesday 15th August</h1>
        <p>Victoria was getting up just as we left to go to Rosemary Avenue to meet the furniture transporters. They took the furniture that is due to go to auction. After our ride yeaterday on the Volks railway we decided to go out after lunch today to the 'steam' railway at a garden centre just the other side of Pulborough. Unfortunately, they were operating a (new) deisel electric engine. Nevertheless Austin and Juniper enjoyed it. We bought four rides for two adults and two children and did two today and will go back next Wednesday for the other two, when they will be running a steam locomotive.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have picked up Victoria's cold, which starts with a sore throught. It didn't help that they were late to bed again!</p>
