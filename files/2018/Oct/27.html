        <h1>Saturday 27th October</h1>
        <p>The morning was bright, but with a frost on the grass, cars and roofs and a northerly wind. Our walk to the Beeding newsagents was extended by returning along the river to Rosemary Avenue to check the heating and alter the clocks, this evening being the time when the clocks go back. So it was nearly eleven when we got home and I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts nd tracking down the mysterious payment into our current account. It seems that the three-year bond with Tesco Bank pays interest annually, but into a nominated account rather than into the bond. Mystery solved. While searching I uncovered a couple of bonds that had matured and been reinvested, but which I had not modified in my 'investments' spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the grass, front and back, while I went into the garage to continue work on the TC. The sun was then on the garage door and so it was not too cold. I went over the areas due to be painted with fine wire wool, to clean and roughen the surface, and then wiped it down with thinners. The paint that I have is 'synthetic', which person in the paint shop said would go over acrylic or synthetic and was easier to brush on. The smell suggests that it is not a water based paint so I opened the garage door and the back door to get a flow of air through the garage.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. Last week she had suggested that Saturday morning would be easier for them than Sunday. Juniper goes to gymnastics later on Saturday morning, but goes to swimming lessons early on a Sunday morning.</p>
