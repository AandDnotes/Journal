        <h1>Wednesday 31st October</h1>
        <p>Halloween! Since we are heading off to Rotterdam tomorrow morning we went to Victoria Grand this morning to visit Dad. From there we went to Sainsbury's to do a little groceries shopping. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and, after checking in for our flights tomorrow and printing off boarding cards, I went into the garage. I painted the off side of the foot ramp, gave the near side a second coat and touched up areas that I could not reach with a half-inch brush.</p>
        <p>I then sent my article 'Introducing TC4985' to John James and later, apart from a visit from a little witch, we packed for the morning.</p>
