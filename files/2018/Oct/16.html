        <h1>Tuesday 16th October</h1>
        <p>Angela caught the ten o'clock bus into Storrington to pay in her WI cash. Meanwhile I generated an Adestra email for the business event survey and sent test copies to Greg and Bernard. Afterwards I tried to open a savings account for Dad with the new Marcus bank. But the online process wanted proof of his identity, using documents that he doesn't have. I phoned them and they came to the conclusion that he has to apply and be approved. In spite of having a power of attorney form, they cannot base it on my identity check. So I looked at closing Dad's 1-2-3 account (and moving the money into his savings account), but I need to go into a branch to do this.</p>
        <p>It was a very sunny and warm morning, so we decided to go after lunch for a walk. By the time we'd finished lunch it had clouded over, but it was still warm and not too windy. So we caught the two o'clock bus that goes through Storrington and got off at Cootham. We then walked through Parham Park and on to Pulborough Brooks, where we had a cup of tea before catching the bus home. We only walked about three miles, but it was quite warm.</p>
