        <h1>Tuesday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>Angela caught the bus into Worthing this morning to go to the hospital for a check on her ears. Then she caught the bus home. Meanwhile I finished connecting up the steering on the TC. The mark on the end of the sector shaft and on the drop arm, when aligned, produced wheels offset from straight ahead when the sector shaft was in its centre position. However, one spline either way made a much bigger offset.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I drove over to Hamish's. We went through the workshop files, set him up on the IET Sussex Office 365 site, uploaded files and looked at some equipment. We collected Sue from the station in the middle, but I was home just before six.</p>
