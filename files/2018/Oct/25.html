        <h1>Thursday 25th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had an appointment at Southlands hospital for a mammogram at 9:15 this morning. It did not take long and so, in spite of road works near Brooklands, we were earlier than usual at Victoria Grand to visit Dad. We then went into Worthing, firstly to Argos to get a watch for Rowan, then to M&amp;S to get some biscuits for Paul (and to have coffee) and finally to Smiths to buy some books. Since it is Thursday we then went on to Sainsbury's to do the grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch we went to Rosemary Avenue to turn on the heating and set it come on for a couple of hours twice a day. We will have to see if it continues to start up when required.</p>
        <p>When we got back, Angela did some tidying in the front garden and I went in the garage to finish 'washing' the underside of the wings of the TC. My plan is to 'wash' the area with de-greaser, then with water and then with thinners before painting.</p>
