        <h1>Sunday 21st October</h1>
        <p>Another dry sunny and quite warm day. However, it was a little too cold to go into the garage until after lunch. So while Angela went to church I did the usual backups and updates and started gathering the dates on which I did various jobs on the TC. After lunch I tried to pull the lower bush in the steering box up a little. I filed a thick washer to fit over the bush (it is indented about half a millimeter), but the other washers bent and the thread on the bolt became damaged. This made it difficult to undo the assembly. I will see if I can find a larger bolt, but I found a large, thin washer and started cutting out a leather washer, both of which I hope to trap between the bottom of the box and the drop arm. We spoke to Paul and later to Victoria.</p>
