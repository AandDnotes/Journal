        <h1>Saturday 6th October</h1>
        <p>The day started with Dick bringing us a cup of tea in bed a little after eight. We had then finished breakfast by about ten and left, in the rain, for Northampton by eleven. We went to visit an Edwardian house (78 Derngate) that had been re-styled by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1916 and had been restored back to that period. We joined a guided tour and then had coffee before returning to Badby for a late (very late) lunch. In fact it was about five o'clock before we had finished!</p>
        <p>By this time the rain had stopped and we all walked to the village hall to watch a film of the Metropolitan Opera production of The Pearl Fishers, shown by the film society. It was very good. The audience members (only about 24) all took some form of canapes and we took our own bottle of wine.</p>
