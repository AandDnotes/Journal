        <h1>Sunday 7th October</h1>
        <p>We had intended leaving Badby this morning, but Kate suggested that, since the weather was fine, we went for a walk around Daventry reservoir before having some lunch before leaving. So after a late breakfast Dick drove us to Daventry and we had a gentle walk around the lake, stopping for a cup of tea part way round. Steven, his wife and daughter arrived while we were eating lunch, mainly to show off the Porche 911 that he had bought.</p>
        <p>We left at 3 o'clock and met stationary traffic on the M40, waiting for 30 minutes before it started moving. Then, on the M25, just before we reached our junction, the traffic again came to a near stand-still. Another half hour of delay before we started moving again. Unfortunately a lot of people were coming off at this junction and so there was another 15 minute delay. We arrived home at 7:30.</p>
        <p>When we got home we spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
