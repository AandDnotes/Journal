        <h1>Friday 26th October</h1>
        <p>It is time for the monthly IET newsletter (so soon). Therefore I spent most of the morning creating it and after lunch got the Adestra system to send a test copy to Bernard for review. Having discovered that Google Forms would not give Greg access to the survey either, I found that you can define 'collaborators'. So I did. We now just need to wait for them to try again.</p>
        <p>It was a little later than planned that I went into the garage to continue preparing the underside parts of the TC's body for painting. I wanted to use degreaser and so needed rubber gloves. It destroys the latex gloves that I use when gluing, so Angela bought some heavy-duty gloves for me when she went down to Steyning. So I then 'washed' the surfaces with degreaser, including the foot ramp, although the latter is difficult to access.</p>
