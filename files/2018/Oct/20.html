        <h1>Saturday 20th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had to take her WI accounts to the auditor, so she also bought a newspaper. That allowed me to do the weekly accounts and transfer money from our current account into our two Kent Reliance 60-day accounts. Before lunch I also replied to Greg's email about comments in the IET Member News.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put the front of the TC up on axle stands and dismantled the steering box. I disconnected the drop arm from the drag link, removed the drop arm and then withdrew the sector shaft, which looks in good condition (apart from the ground top to clear the Tompkins kit). To my surprise there shaft was running in two bushes (that look like king pin bushes) and there was no oil seal, in fact no rebate for the seal. Later I posted a question to the mg-tabc members and started getting replies.</p>
