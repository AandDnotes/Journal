        <h1>Wednesday 10th October</h1>
        <p>The forecast was for a warm, sunny day and it was. Angela walked to Steyning to talk to Angus and call in at Rosemary Avenue, while I drove the TC to Parham House, just the other side of Storrington, for coffee in the Big Kitchen. Then the Sussex Wanderers did a slightly shorter run than usual, only just over 20 miles, and arrived back at Parham House for lunch. There was a good selection of cars, including an 18/8, a J2 and a triple-M. Overall I drove the TC 42 miles. I arrived home at about 2:30, while Angela was at table tennis. So I ordered an oil seal for the steering box and started catching up with documenting outings and work on the TC.</p>
