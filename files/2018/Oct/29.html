        <h1>Monday 29th October</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Monday we started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. They were doing staff training and the drive was full of cars, so we had to park around the corner. Afterwards we went into Worthing to buy a book for Krista, an umbrella for Paul and some fish for today's dinner and for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the nurse to have her ear cleaned and I went into the garage to continue painting the car. I did the off side rear wheel arch and then under the near side running board and front wing. Just the rear wheel arch and the foot ramp to do.</p>
