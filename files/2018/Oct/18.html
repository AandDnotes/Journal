        <h1>Thursday 18th October</h1>
        <p>Our routine for Thursdays is to firstly visit Dad at Victoria Grand and then to go on to do the weekly grocery shop. Today was no exception. However, in between the two we went into Worthing to visit Santander to try to close Dad's 1-2-3 account and move the contents into his savings account. The Santander help page said it was necessary to visit a branch to do this. But the person to whom we spoke showed us how to do it online. At least, where to go on the web site to send a secure message to ask for this to be done. We now need to wait for a reply.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I took the TC for the usual figure of eight test run after re-building the jet assembly in the front carburetter. It seemed to run well, although it took some while before the synchromesh going from second gear to third started working. I then put the car in the middle of the garage in preparation to replace the oil seal in the steering box.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner Angela went to a church meeting in Goring. A number of them were going, so Angela had to take the Panda.</p>
