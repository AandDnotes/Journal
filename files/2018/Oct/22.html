        <h1>Monday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>A bright, sunny, but slightly cooler day. We went to Victoria Grand and then on to Waitrose for coffee (in their refurbished cafe) and to buy a few items, including bottles of wine for the WI auditor.</p>
        <p>After lunch we heard from the estate agent, Ben. He says that there is about seven weeks of the house-buying season left this year, so we agreed to lower the price from £675,000 to £649,950.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage and struggled getting the steering box re-assembled and re-connected. I managed to get a leather washer and a thin steel washer on the bottom of the sector shaft above the drop arm. I re-connected the drop arm to the drag link and put oil in the box, but then discovered that, with the sector shaft in its middle position, the wheels were not pointing straight ahead. So I had to disconnect everything and move the drop arm a couple of points on the spline. But still not right! I also found that, with the new washers, the steering becomes tight at the centre position. The peg must be tighter in the groove.</p>
