        <h1>Wednesday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off this morning to get her hair cut, while I ran the TC's engine for a few minutes before tightening the hed nuts. I was surprised to find that you cannot get a socket on the nuts without removing the rocker gear! After lunch I warmed up the engine and adjusted the tappets, then adjusted the timing and carburetters. The plugs were quite sooty, so I made the mixture quite a bit leaner. When Angela got back from her table tennis she helped me put the bonnet back.</p>
        <p>After a relatively early dinner we walked down to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'The Guernsey Literature and Potato Peel Pie Society'. It was very good.</p>
