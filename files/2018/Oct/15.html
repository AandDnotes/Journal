        <h1>Monday 15th October</h1>
        <p>Being Monday I started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. Angela stayed at home to prepare for her WI meeting that she went to after lunch. I found a suitable bolt for the slow running cable, drilled a hole in it and fitted it to the car. Unfortunately, after running the engine for a while I decided to adjust the cable and the bolt broke on one side of the hole! I think that I over-tightened it. Lifting each piston in turn caused the revs to drop, which suggests that the mixture is too lean. Both mixture controls are set six flats from the top.</p>
        <p>Just before dinner I spoke to the chair of the parish council about tomorrow's neighbourhood plan meeting. It is really just a planning meeting, so only worth going to the open meeting in November.</p>
        <p>After dinner I created the survey for our business event and modified Greg's word for the email.</p>
