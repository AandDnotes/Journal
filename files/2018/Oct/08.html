        <h1>Monday 8th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had a WI committee meeting here this morning and was due to help at the lunch club. So, just as people started arriving for the meeting I took the TC off to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. I got back at 12:10, ten minutes after Angela had left for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>After lunch I sent some more information to the new SLOs and then went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington. We had a film of the 1958 Alpine rally. I also spoke with a South African who has all the parts for a TD that he wants to sell.</p>
