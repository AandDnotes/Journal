        <h1>Tuesday 2nd October</h1>
        <p>Quite a momentous morning. After tightening some hose clips and fixing a fuel leak on the rear carburetter the engine started after about a quarter of a turn. After lunch I adjusted the timing and the fuel/air mixture before showering and driving to Crawley for our first IET talk of the season. Unfortunately we only had 15 attendees.</p>
