        <h1>Saturday 13th October</h1>
        <p>Angela had an early start. She was meeting people for breakfast at The Hub in Beeding at eight o'clock. She was home at about ten. Meanwhile I had breakfast on my own and then spent the morning doing the weekly accounts (I had not done them last week), completing the monthly accounts (that I had started before we went to Badby) and updated the share prices and dividends records.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the grass, front and back, and I cleared out the gutters and what I could reach of the valley gutters. I also cut down part of a tree that was overhanging from the wood.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I removed the jet assembly from the TC's carburetter. I found that the  main retaining nut was not pinching the cork seal and one of the two internal glands (brass 'cup' and cork seal) was missing. Luckily I had some spare parts in the 'bits' that Brian Yates had given me, so I cleaned and 're-built' the jet assembly and fitted it. I replaced the piston and needle and centred the jet as described in 'Tuning SU Carburetters' (page 21).</p>
