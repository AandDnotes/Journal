        <h1>Tuesday9th October</h1>
        <p>We were up fairly late and it was mid-morning before Angela walked to Steyning (although she had hung out one lot of washing and had put on another) and I dealt with some IET email. After lunch I went to Field Place, to an RCEA talk by Calum Chase on AI and his 'two singularities'; the point where Artificial General Intelligence in machines matches human intelligence and the point where there is no work for the majority of people because machines are doing it all. He's a good speaker, but he tried to condense his whole book into an hour and so it was difficult to keep up with the arguments, even though they were not technical.</p>
