        <h1>Wednesday 17th October</h1>
        <p>This morning we started by booking flights to Amsterdam at the beginning of November. By using Avios points to get money off, flying was a lot cheaper than going by train and also avoids an early morning trip around the M25. Afterwards I requested approval for our email to IET members to complete our small survey. Later I had to set the distribution date later so as to be five days later than the newsletter.</p>
        <p>I also started making a new connector for the slow-running cable, but found the bolt too hard to drill. After lunch I found a 'softer' bolt and connected up the cable. I also updated the slides for our IET talks and later in the day went to Falmer for a talk on the development of a wearable sensor module.</p>
