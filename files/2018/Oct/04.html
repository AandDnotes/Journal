        <h1>Thursday 4th October</h1>
        <p>After our usual visit to Victoria Grand this morning we called into Morrisons, mainly to get some flowers, but also to do the rest of our food shopping, since we didn't need a lot. After lunch we collected a copy of house brochure from the agent and checked Rosemary Avenue.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I took the TC to Beeding to get some petrol and then did my usual six-mile figure of eight test run. I used the new Morris fuel additive, which is much easier to use than the Miller additive. The engine seemed to run well. Next week I will try a longer run.</p>
