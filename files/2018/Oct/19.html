        <h1>Friday 19th October</h1>
        <p>The day really revolved around a house viewing at two o'clock. Angela started by cleaning the front porch again and I filled gaps around the ceiling, both in an attempt to stop the smell that started the other day. We then walked into Steyning to post birthday cards, get Dad some cash and go to the butcher. Afterwards we sorted out some things to take to the tip. After lunch we went to Rosemary Avenue just as the agent arrived. We sorted out more stuff and then went to Shoreham tip and the Dog's Trust.</p>
        <p>When we got home I went in the garage and measured the cylinder compression. They all reached a reasonable level, but took a long time to get there. This may indicate that the piston rings are worn. Afterwards I completed documenting the work on the engine head.</p>
