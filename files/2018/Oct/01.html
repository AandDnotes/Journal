        <h1>Monday 1st October</h1>
        <p>Monday took its usual course. We went to Victoria Grand to visit Dad, showing him photos of Austin in his plaster cast. From there we went into Worthing so that Angela could pay in her coffee morning cash and get a WI bank statement. The queue in NatWest, where she had to pay in the cash, almost reached the door and it took us 20 minutes. From there we called into Sainsbury's to do a little food shopping and to buy Austin and Juniper a pair of 'shark' slippers.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was back into the garage. I fitted the carburetter overflow pipes and connected up the slow running and choke cables, plus the accelerator pedal return spring. Then I fitted the distributor, set the points gap and then cleaned, adjusted and fitted the spark plugs. Following that I fitted the rocker box gasket, using Hylomar to 'stick' it to the head, poured a little oil over the rocker gear and fitted the rocker cover. Then I mixed up some antifreeze and filled the system. Even after a little problem knowing whether the taps were open or closed, the system did not take anywhere near the quoted eight litres. Luckily, as I was filling the system, I noticed that I had not done up one of the jubilee clips!</p>
        <p>So tomorrow I can turn on the ignition, which will start the fuel pump. I can then see if I have any fuel leaks before trying to start the engine.</p>
