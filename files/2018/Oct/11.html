        <h1>Thursday 11th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the hearing clinic this morning to get more batteries before going off to do the weekly grocery shopping. Meanwhile I did some more of my TC head removal documentation while waiting for Hamish to collect me. We went to STEM Sussex to meet up with Gavin and Ramon and introduce them to Estelle (who was really the only one in the office. We were also able to give them all the kit that we both had!</p>
        <p>I got home at three o'clock and so had a late lunch, although Hamish and I had coffee in the library cafe before we left Brighton. I then realised that I was late in producing my IET newsletter, so spent most of the evening drafting it and getting a test copy sent to Bernard for review.</p>
