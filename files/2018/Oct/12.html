        <h1>Friday 12th October</h1>
        <p>Since we were not able to visit dad yesterday we started with a trip to Victoria Grand. Afterwards we went into Worthing to RBS (to pay in the cheque from Toovey's). We also bought some birthday cards and some egg cups for Victoria.</p>
        <p>After lunch I submitted this month's newsletter for approval while Angela went to Steyning. Later I went into the garage, starting by repairing the doors and cleaning out the track. I then looked at the spark plugs, finding that they are still too sooty. Then I removed the forward carburetter. I dismantled it on the bench, ready to remove the jet.</p>
