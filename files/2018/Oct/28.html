        <h1>Sunday 28th October</h1>
        <p>It was not quite so cold, but was overcast. Angela had a church meeting after the church service this morning, so was late home. I spent the morning doing updates on the Linux and Windows systems and backed up some files. Then I did a little more to the article for Totally T-type that I had started yesterday evening.</p>
        <p>By the time that I had finished lunch (on my own) the sun had come out, so I went into the garage and started applying paint to the underside of the TC. I coated under the offside running board and the offside front wing. I'm undecided whether it will need a second coat, but I was really pleased with the colour match, even though it is in areas that are not directly seen against parts of the body top.</p>
        <p>The clocks went back last night, so it got dark earlier. By the time that we had finished talking with Paul and Rowan it was getting very gloomy, but I only had my brush to clean. I then prepared the small images of talk posters and inserted them into my November newsletter.</p>
