        <h1>Sunday 14th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I started by reconciling the bank statement against my accounts spreadsheet. I then went into the garage, completed assembling the carburetter and re-fitted it. After lunch I started connecting up the carburetter, but the bolt that clamps the slow running cable broke across the hole through which the cable passes. So I spent quite some time searching for a replacement before a chat with Paul. We found out a little about their new ponies, ten-year old Freda and her five month old son that Rowan wants to call Moon.</p>
