        <h1>Tuesday 30th October</h1>
        <p>Angela went off early this morning for an all-day event in Burgess Hill. I emailed the IET Sussex committee about the AGM and their wish to continue on the committee. I then painted under the rear near side wheel arch. Since I was going out in the evening I cooked some salmon for lunch. Then I went to sleep in the chair! I only just had time to paint one side of the foot ramp and clean the brush before geting read to go out. Angela arrived home just before I went to Ricardo for an IMechE talk on the 'de-fossilisation of transport. It was followed by a STEM event for which I had registered. The talk was very good, even though it heavy on detailed information. The STEM event was interesting, but I'm not sure how it helped. There was not really any proposals on how we could do things better.</p>
