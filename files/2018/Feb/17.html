        <h1>Saturday 17th February</h1>
        <p>It was a bright and sunny day, with light winds. So we started the morning by walking to Beeding to buy a newspaper. We didn't have long before it was necessary to change and walk to the Methodist church for the St Barnabas Cottage pie lunch. When we got home, around three, I started filling in teh IHT forms.</p>
