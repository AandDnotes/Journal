        <h1>Saturday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>Pretty much most of the day was spent sorting out things at Berriedale Drive. Alan and Chris arrived at about 11:30. After some pizza that they brought with them they went off to visit Dad in hospital. He was fine. We then had a 'rummage' in the loft. They had decided to book into the Highdown Hotel, which has a carvery. So we joined them for dinner.</p>
