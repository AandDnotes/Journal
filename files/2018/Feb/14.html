        <h1>Wednesday 14th February</h1>
        <p>I spent most of the morning drafting this month's IET newsletter, sending it to Bernard for editorial review. I then added the required text to each page of the LPA document and printing it so that Dad can sign each page tomorrow when we visit him. We also received the offer notification letter from Jacobs Steel. As usual, Angela went to table tennis this afternoon.</p>
