        <h1>Wednesday 28th February</h1>
        <p>A little more snow this morning, but the sun was shining and so the snow gradually dissappeared during the day. This morning I tested my tank simulation and worked on the IHT forms. Then I walked down to Church Street to give two talks on engineering to small groups. It was a pity that the first group were 15 minutes late for a half-hour talk! After lunch Angela went to table tennis, but I wasn't back until just before two. After my lunch I did a little of the jigsaw and then the IET schools equipment that I'd ordered arrived. It took a while to unpack it and dispose of the boxes. I also finished (as far as I can) the IHT forms. We also arranged for Toovey's to call at Rosemary avenue to produce a contents valuation.</p>
