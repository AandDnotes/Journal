        <h1>Sunday 4th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela was at church I met Anlan and Chris at Berriedale Drive where we continued clearing out draws and cupboards. Just before one, they left for the tip, with a car full of rubbish and things for recycling and I brought a lot of recycling home. After lunch we went to visit Dad in hospital. He is in a single, isolation room, but was sitting in a chair and said he felt fine. However, he has not been eating. Certainly he looked much better than the last time that we visited on Friday. Angela went off to get him a newspaper. When we got home we spoke with Victoria and then with Paul.</p>
