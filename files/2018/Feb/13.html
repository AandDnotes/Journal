        <h1>Tuesday 13th February</h1>
        <p>We had an offer on Berriedale Drive. I spoke to Dad (and tried Alan, but could not get him) and then accepted it. I then had a call from Ricky's suggested solicitor (in Storrington) and scanned in the LPA. After lunch I went to Field Place for the RCEA talk about the work of the National Grid Control Centre. On the way back I called into Majestic Wines for my free bottle of Proseco from Barclays. We had some good pancakes after dinner (what with it being Shrove Tuesday).</p>
