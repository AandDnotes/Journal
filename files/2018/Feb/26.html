        <h1>Monday 26th February</h1>
        <p>I had a list of things to do today, but did not get very far through them. We started by visiting Dad, calling in at Berriedale Drive on the way and picking up more photo albums. The boiler was still working after resetting it on Thursday. From Victoria Grand we went to Waitrose to buy a few items and have coffee. So it was lunchtime by the time we got home. After a little puzzling after lunch I started my first job, to run through my talk on engineering prior to Wednesday's visit to Steyning Grammar. I started by trying to run the tank simulation and found that the python code would not run! It had worked a couple of weeks ago and I was not aware of having made andy changes. Anyway, it took most of the afternoon to solve the problem, even though I still don't know why the problem existed. After running through the slides I found and printed the worksheets for the energy watch workshop and listed the files and links that are used. Hamish and I will need to run through these with Mike tomorrow. And then time ran out!</p>
