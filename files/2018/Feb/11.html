        <h1>Sunday 11th February</h1>
        <p>I spent most of the morning text chatting to Apple support advisors about my mail problems, while Angela went to church. The conclusion was that, because the iCloud account uses the Gmail address, creating a Gmail account had problems. So I had to remove iCloud, add Gmail and then re-add iCloud. It seemed to work. After lunch I did the same to the MacBook before we spoke to Paul and then to Victoria.</p>
