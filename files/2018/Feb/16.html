        <h1>Friday 16th February</h1>
        <p>We started the day by walking down to Steyning, making appointments at the opticain and taking a repeat prescription to the health centre, before catching the bus to Storrington. There I took the LPA to the solicitors to be copied before we had a quick coffee and caught the bas back. Angela got off in Steyning and I came home. After lunch we went over to Berriedale Drive and took some rubbish to the tip in Shoreham.</p>
