        <h1>Thursday 15th February</h1>
        <p>We started the day by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand, taking him more photo albums. While we were there a nurse called, who tries to make sure that hospital patients don't return. She is going to arrange for his catheter to be removed. We also got him to sign every page of the LPA so that we now have a copy. Afterwards we went to Sainsbury's for lunch and to shop, before going on to Berriedale Road. More clearing and we called in to the tip on the way home.</p>
