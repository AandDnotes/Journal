        <h1>Thursday 1st February</h1>
        <p>Angela thought that today was a stressful day! We had some flexibility and started by Angela going to to get new batteries for her hearing aid and me going for a haircut. We then went to visit Dad. He was noticably better; sitting up in bed. Only I dressed up and went in to talk with him. During the afternoon the owner of the wood took a digger in there and started ripping up and breaking down trees! I phoned Horsham planners and spoke with Jason.</p>
