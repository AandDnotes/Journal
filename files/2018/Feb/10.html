        <h1>Saturday 10th February</h1>
        <p>It seems a long time since we walked to the Beeding newsagents to buy a paper on a Saturday morning,but we did that today. It is a pity that it started raining on the way. We had a fairly gentle day catching up with things and dealing with more correspondence relating to Bay's estate. I've been having problems with mail. Each Mac client and the web clinet all show different numbers of read mail and messages in my inbox!. So, after dinner, I deleted the account from the MacBook and tried to reinstate it. But so far nothing is appearing!</p>
