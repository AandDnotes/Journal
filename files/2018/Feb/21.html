        <h1>Wednesday 21st February</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went out to meet her WI president and to call into Bay's to look at her jewelry. I oreded more stuff from the IET Marketing Toolkit and sent some emails. Just before lunch I booked our Eurostar tickets (the web site was working today) to Rotterdam. After lunch I booked parking at Ebbsfleet and our coach tour to Keukenhof. There is some confusion over where we pick up the coach, but I have asked for clarification. Later I went to a Falmer to an IET talk on Industry 4.0.</p>
