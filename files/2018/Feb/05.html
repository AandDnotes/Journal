        <h1>Monday 5th February</h1>
        <p>I worked through some of my email that had been accumulating and started the monthly accounts, while Angela went to Steyning and to visit a WI friend. After lunch she went to give blood and I winished the accounts and went to visit Dad in Hospital. He is looking much better and might be discharged this week.</p>
