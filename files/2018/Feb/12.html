        <h1>Monday 12th February</h1>
        <p>Angela had her WI committee meeting here, while I tried talking with Scottish Power about Bay's account. I went to visit Dad and called into Berriedale before returning for lunch. Meanwhile Angela went to help at the lunch club. Later I managed to get things sorted out with Scotish Power, got M&G to send us the appropriate form and booked my dinner at the Queens Head prior to the WSMGOC meeting. At that meeting I won a bowl of narsisus, took Brian Yates' photo albums and gave them to Margarate Drake and left without paying my bill? I phoned the pub from home and found that Chris Rickard had paid it for me. So I emailed him. While I was out we had a call from Jacobs Steel to say that an offer had been made on Dad's house.</p>
