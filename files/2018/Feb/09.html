        <h1>Friday 9th February</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went to Bay's to wait for the collection of aids and to pass on flowers and food. She also went down to Steyning and we collected our lunch from that left over from yesterday. After lunch we went to visit Dad at Victoria Grand and tehn went on to collect nuts and bolts and photo albums from Brian Yates in Goring. We then went on to Sainsbury's.</p>
