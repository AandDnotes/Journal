        <h1>Friday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela took me to Shoreham station to catch the train into London. She then went to her doctor's appointment. I went to Savoy Place for lunch and then went to the HUBSEE Steering Group meeting at the Engineering Council office. Afterwards I went back to Savoy Place, before catching the train home. Angela collected me from Shoreham at about 8:45.</p>
