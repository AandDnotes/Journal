        <h1>Thursday 8th February</h1>
        <p>We started early with a trip to M&S to collect the food that we had ordered and buy some other items. We took them to Bay's and then went to Worthing station to meet Sally and Richard. We all then went on to the crematorium, via Rogers Farm to pick up a cup of tea. After the ceremony we all went back to Bay's house for lunch. After everyone else had gone I took Sally and Richard to the station while Angela finished clearing up.</p>
