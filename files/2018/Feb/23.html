        <h1>Friday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>This morning I went off to the Eurotherm office to meet Mark and Simon. It was a pity that I was an hour early! However, we had an interesting meeting (until 2pm) and then went for lunch around the corner. Meanwhile Angela had been down to Steyning. When I got home we did some more of the jigsaw.</p>
