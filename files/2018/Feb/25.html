        <h1>Sunday 25th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went to Rosemary Avenue on the way to church to pick up post. Meanwhile I sorted out more of Dad's stuff and worked through the solicitor's forms. Then I started updating Bay's estate spreadsheet. After lunch we worked on the jigsaw, then I did some more on the spreadsheet.</p>
