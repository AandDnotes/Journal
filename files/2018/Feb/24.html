        <h1>Saturday 24th February</h1>
        <p>Most of the afternoon was spent watching the Winter Olympics or doing the jigsaw puzzle. Before lunch Angela spent most of the morning at the 'Steyning Showcase', either to get signatures from her WI committee members or to 'man' the WI stall. I did the weekly accounts, updated software and completed a form for the solicitor.</p>
