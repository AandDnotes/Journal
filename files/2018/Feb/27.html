        <h1>Tuesday 27th February</h1>
        <p>We woke this morning to a covering of snow. It sounded worse elsewhere (eastwards), but was only a couple of centimeters here. It wasn't a problem for Hamish and Mike to come over. We worked through the Energy Watch short workshop before going down to the Chequers for lunch. Afterwards I filled in the solicitor's forms for the sale of Berriedale Drive before doing a little more of the jigsaw.</p>
