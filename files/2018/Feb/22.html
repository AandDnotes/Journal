        <h1>Thursday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Angela started by having her hair cut, before we went off to visit Dad. While we were there Di and Eddie arived. We went on into Worthing to ask RSB to pay Bay's funeral bill and buy some shoes for table tennis. Then we went to Lyons Farm to buy a new set of cordless phones (with all four handsets now being on charge) and do our food shopping. We took some sandwiches to Berriedale Drive for lunch. We then did a little bit of tidying before coming home for a cup of tea.</p>
