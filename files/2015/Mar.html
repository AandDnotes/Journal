        <p>Sunday 1st March<br />
        After our usual walk to the newsagents I spent the morning completing the Springboard grants form, scanning it, posting the original and e-mailing the copy. Then I spent some time looking at the Barefoot documents and watching the videos. Later I mapped out the structure of the workshop and sent Adam my suggestion for how to divide it up. We also spoke to Victoria and Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 2nd March<br />
        I went over to Dad's this morning so as to change his bed. Meanwhile, Angela went down to Steyning. After lunch we took Bay to Worthing, to the cinema to the Marigold Hotel. After dinner, Angela went to a church meeting while I replied to Julian Thorpe at Sussex about a talk on electron microscopy.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 3rd March<br />
        This morning I caught the 9:30 bus into Shoreham. As it pulled into the bus lay-by so a number 700 bus was already at the stop, so I had only a couple of minutes wait on that bus before it set off. So I arrived at Edward Street five minutes early. I then had a good meeting with Nigel Clout about how he was settling in and what he could do with the data available. Then I went to see Howard Rush. After a while we walked down the road to a cafe that he frequently uses and had some lunch. After a walk to Churchill Square I caught a slightly earlier 700 bus than I had planned and had a 20 minute wait at Shoreham for the Steyning bus. I got off that bus outside the Kings Head in Beeding and went into the barbers for a haircut, arriving home just after 3:30. Meanwhile, Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and then on to the garden centre.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 4th March<br />
        Not a very productive day. I spent a lot of time trying to find a way to get Scratch to recognise serial ports. But failed. However, I did investigate Scratch 2. I was also asked by Sam Davis and Steve Maycok to chair the next DAG meeting since Steve can't make it.</p>
        <p>Thursday 5th March<br />
        Shopping day again. After lunch I dealt with my e-mail and then tracked down a Scratch 2 interface to Arduino.</p>
        <p>Friday 6th March<br />
        A much more productive day. During the morning I went to the Springboard Grants meeting. I also spoke with Steve and Sam about chairing the next DAG meeting. This afternoon I managed to get Scratch 2 to control an Arduino. Even though it did not then work a second time.</p>
        <p>Saturday 7th March<br />
        Quite a busy day. After walking to Beeding to buy a paper, I checked over the car and fixed a puncture (actually an abrasion) in one of the inner tubes of the wheelchair. Then I finally managed to get my secateurs apart by applying a little heat. So I finished cleaning them and put them back together. Meanwhile, Angela worked in the garden. After lunch I dug a little compost and then mowed the grass in the back garden.<br />
        My Scratch 2 to Arduino (using Firmata) worked when driving a digital set to output mode, but gave an error when I enabled a digital pin as an input. I got a similar error when I tried to enable an analogue input.</p>
        <p>Sunday 8th March<br />
        The usual walk to the newsagents was followed by a piano practice and an investigation of the problem that I found yesterday with the Scratch 2 interface to Arduino. But failed to find the cause of the problem. So after lunch I cut the front grass (and met Nick opposite). Later I sent a message to the author of the interface software. We also spoke to firstly Paul and then Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 9th March<br />
        This morning we went over to Dad's with the intent of cutting his grass (and change his and put on his washing), but it was too wet. So we pruned a rose bush and a lilac bush. We also cleared the grass from the rose bush bed and dug out some compost. After lunch I installed the new version of PyMata, which worked. But Alan Y did not seem to understand my simulation question. We also walked down to Steyning to get some vegetables and buy tickets for Saturday's concert.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 10th March<br />
        A day of two halves. This morning I investigated further the use of Scratch 2 and the s2a_fm interface to Arduino. I made some progress in understanding how the Scratch 2 extensions work and investigated the use of custom blocks.<br />
        After lunch I went to the retired engineer's meeting; this month (the last until September) on the future use of steam trains on the rail network. This evening I went to an IET events sub-committee meeting at Bernard's house.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 11th March<br />
        A day at home. Angela was at a committee meeting this morning and went to table tennis this afternoon. However, this morning I mailed a number of people about finding a PV speaker. I also sent Jules a draft title and synopsis. Then I experimented with broadcast messages in Scratch and mailed Alan Y to give him an update. I then started drawing a design for a base Scratch file.</p>
        <p>Thursday 12th March<br />
        We were fairly early arriving at Dad's this morning to compile his shopping list. Then off to firstly M&amp;S (including a stop for coffee) and then Tesco. This afternoon I spent some time working though the Barefoot slides. Then I did a little more on my design for a Scratch simulation and Arduino interface.</p>
        <p>Friday 13th March<br />
        A day with ups and downs. We booked seats to see Mac &amp; Mabel at Chichester Theatre for us, Bay and Dad. I then wasted a lot of time time trying to print the tickets, until I discovered that all the black cartridge jets were blocked.<br />
        Simon delivered the replacement LED light bulb and I fitted it. Then, since the dishwasher said their was a problem with the water supply, I disconnected it and checked the filter. It looked fine, so we will see how it goes. It was quite difficult to undo the connection.<br />
        Angela was back very late for her lunch, after which we went to the garden centre to use a discount voucher on plants we collected yesterday. After a lot of effort it only saved about a pound! We also went into Maplins to buy a transistor and a diode for use when making an Arduino drive a dc motor.<br />
        After dinner I went to the Worthing Leisure Centre for an SRFC meeting. But it was held last Friday! The original list of meetings had it down for today, but subsequent email changed it to the 6th. I put entries into my calendar from the initial list.</p>
        <p>Saturday 14th March<br />
        There was a biting wind as we walked to Beeding newsagents this morning. After reading some of the paper I did the weekly accounts, which took longer than usual due to some missing entries. I finished them after lunch and then set up a circuit on the breadboard for a motor driver. Firstly I got it working with an Arduino sketch and then added the motor and an LED output to the Scratch program. After dinner we took Bay to the Music Society concert, a string quartet. The Hayden piece was pleasant, the Janacek was odd (written in his seventies), but the Beethoven piece was good.</p>
        <p>Sunday 15th March<br />
        A usual sort of Sunday; a walk to the newsagents, reading the paper and talking to Victoria and Paul. I managed to progress my Scratch/Arduino interface base software a little.</p>
        <p>Monday 16th March<br />
        After marking the pages of the Barefoot presentation to show who will handle each, I went over to Dad's to turn his bed clothes over and top up his pill box (we will not do the shopping until Friday this week). I spent most of the rest of the day working on my Scratch/Arduino demonstrator (in the form of a clown), although I have only wired up one I/O of each type).<br />
        I also had a positive reply from Tim Brunton about a talk on PV technology. So I replied to him.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 17th March<br />
        A really busy day. It started with a trip to Ferring, to George's house, to look at the Advances Sports Imaging project with George and Hamish. We sorted out the documentation and worked out how to use the high-speed cameras. We now need to find out how to make the measurements and then find and work out how to use the thermal imaging camera.<br />
        After lunch I went to St Mary's CofE Primary School in East Grinstead to help run a Barefoot Computing workshop. We only had nine attendees, but it seemed to go well. I finally met Adam Martin, who 'prints' components for a marble run that can be 'programmed' by setting switches in the modules. He sells them to schools.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 18th March<br />
        The morning was spent mainly catching up with the events of yesterday and started preparing for next week. I sent a brief update to Barefoot and later sent the feedback forms and an expenses form. I also started looking at the the DAG documents and the notes for chair.<br />
        After lunch I went over to Dad and cut his grass. Luckily his old mower started easily. I also made a start at updating the Windows system on the laptop.</p>
        <p>Thursday 19th March<br />
        I spent nearly all morning upgrading the laptop's Windows OS to 8.1. This required updating everything in the 8.0 version first! After lunch I worked through the DAG documents and e-mailed questions to Melissa. Finally I spent a little time making a slight modification to my Scratch 2 clown simulation. Angela went off just before lunch to have a meal with friends in Worthing before going to see a production of Hairspray at the Pavilion.</p>
        <p>Friday 20th March<br />
        Since Angela was out yesterday, we did the shopping today. However, we had to wait until Angela had been to the hygienist. Although we got to Dad's just after midday, I spent some time trying to get the tube out of his bathroom light, but without success. So we arrived at Holmbush just after one and so went straight into M&amp;S to have some lunch. We let ourselves into Dad's house to put away his shopping, since Dad had gone to his Friday club. While Angela took Bay's shopping to her I researched Dad's bathroom light fitting and looked further into remote X desktops for the Pi.</p>
        <p>Saturday 21st March<br />
        We decided this morning to look for a new bathroom light for Dad and a new shade for our inner hall. So we firstly went to Dunelm Mill, which had no bathroom lights, and then to B&amp;Q, where we found both. The hall shade took little effort to replace. However, considerably more effort was needed to replace Dad's bathroom light fitting, which I did this afternoon. I also found a little time to do some further investigation of VNC and X-Window interfaces to the Pi. Whilst I was out this afternoon, Angela spent time working in the front garden.</p>
        <p>Sunday 22nd March<br />
        Our walk to the newsagents this morning turned out to be a little longer than expected. They had run out of Telegraphs and so we had to walk on to the BP garage. Then it was time to do the weekly accounts, (try to) play the piano and work some more on my X11 interface to the Pi. I made progress. The old Pi image works, but the new image seems to have lost some of the desktop! We then spoke to Victoria (and Austin) and Paul (and Rowan) before dinner.</p>
        <p>Monday 23rd March<br />
        After Angela had put out the washing we went over to Dad's to change his bed and do his washing. We also cleaned his doors and the inside and out of the patio door in his living room. Before we went to Dad's and while Angela went to give blood in the afternoon I found out why the panel was not appearing on the X desktop. I can now connect using X through ssh via the router and via a direct connection.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 24th March<br />
        I up at six o'clock this morning so as to get to Moulscombe in time for the DAG meeting. However, the traffic was light and so I was half an hour early. We were late starting the meeting due to the earlier than usual start (9 o'clock), but my chairmanship seemed to work; just. We finished at eleven, when the next users of the room arrived, even though we hadn't quite finished. I got home at about 11:30, while Angela was at a WI meeting. During the afternoon I responded to a question from Melissa about the meeting and then researched flights to Amsterdam and trains to Rotterdam. I booked flights, parking and the cattery, and e-mailed Paul.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 25th March<br />
        I spent a lot of time this morning trying to reduce the effort required to open a Remote Desktop on the Pi via an X ssh connection.. I ended up with two scripts, one of which still needed to be run by entering its path.<br />
        After lunch, while Angela went to table tennis, I cleared the gutters and removed mould from tiles and shower screen in the bathroom. Then I started looking at documenting the Scratch/Arduino interface. I produced a block diagram and investigated using Alterpages to build html pages. But it does not allow images to be sized as I want, so I might need to build it offline and upload the files.</p>
        <p>Thursday 26th March<br />
        Shopping day again and, after calling on Dad to make out his list, we started with a coffee and pain raisin, curtesy of the Mail and enough stamps on the M&amp;S coffee card. After topping up Dad's pill box we were quite late home for lunch. Then, while Angela went to take Bay her shopping, I tried to start generating a description of my Scratch to Arduino interface using iWeb. I discovered that iWeb does not run on Yosemite and has not been supported fro three years! So I installed Amya to give that a try. It is pretty awful! I will revert to just using a text editor. </p>
        <p>Friday 27th March<br />
        Apart from a short walk up the lane with Angela to see some lambs at the farm, most of the day was spent preparing drawings/images for my documentation of the Scratch/Arduino demonstrator or experimenting with html and the Altervista web server. Although, while Angela was in Worthing and at Bay's, I did give the mould on parts of the shower screen in the bathroom and the shower room some treatment. I also tried to descale the shower room shower head.</p>
        <p>Saturday 28th March<br />
        The air was 'wet' as we walked to the newsagents this morning. The weather then deteriorated! So I spent most of the day sat at one computer or another. I did the weekly accounts, completed the schematic of the circuits for my demonstrator, saved images of the breadboard and schematic views and worked on the web page for the demonstrator. I've recorded the background information and have just started actually describing the project.</p>
        <p>Sunday 29th March<br />
        The usual walk to the newsagents was followed by playing the piano, practicing flying on the simulator, installing updates on Windows and doing a little work on documenting my Scratch/Arduino demonstrator. I also drafted a reply to Steve Maycock (and the DAG) on donor acceptance. However, we spent quite a lot of time talking with Paul/Rowan and Victoria/Austin. So much so that we had a dinner that was more warm than hot.</p>
        <p>Monday 30th March<br />
        Angela did two sets of washing and hung them out before we went off to the tip and then on to Dad's. We had collected Bay's two old vacuum cleaners yesterday afternoon and added some things that we had been collecting. So we disposed of them and then turned over Dad's bed. We found an empty dirty washing bin, but could not find any trousers, shirts or jumpers that seemed to need washing. Dad tried on some trousers to ensure that they fit him, but hung them back in his wardrobe. So he will probably forget which ones he should pack! Afterwards we went to Lyons Farm to buy a few groceries and have some lunch. This afternoon Angela cut the back grass and I cut the front grass. I also did a little on my Scratch/Arduino document.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 31st March<br />
        Apart from going out to the cold frame to replace one of the top sections I have not ventured out today. Angela went to Steyning and otherwise worked in the greenhouse and did housework. I gave the shower heads a soak in cleaner, but otherwise completed my web page on my Scratch/Arduino demonstrator and mailed George and Hamish. I gave up trying to find a way to prevent Internet Explorer put bullet point symbols in the middle of an image! I also approved the minutes of the last DAG meeting.</p>
