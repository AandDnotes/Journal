        <p>Wednesday 1st July</p>
        <p>We had a good day out today. We set off a little before midday with a packed lunch to Trebah gardens on the south coast of Cornwall. It was very similar to the Helligan valley, but with good playgrounds for children. We had our lunch on the private beach and then had a cup of tea in the cafe. On our way back we called into Tesco to buy food for dinner, which we cooked in the cottage.</p>
        <p>Thursday 2nd July</p>
        <p>A very tiring day! At about eleven o'clock Paul and Krista set off to St Ives, where they were meeting some friends from London, who just happened to be on holiday this week. We also set off for Marazion, from where you can walk across the causeway to St Michael's Mount. It had been raining most of the morning and we set off in walking boots, jumpers and kagouls. By the time we had walked across the causeway, in the rain, it had stopped raining and by the time we had eaten some lunch in one of the cafes the sun had come out. Of course, the one thing that I left in the car was my sun hat! The castle and gardens were really good. We were glad that we were wearing boots, since the best paths were cobbles and there were a lot of rocks to clamber over. By the time that we were ready to return to the mainland the tide was in and so we had to catch one of the small boats back.when we got back to the cottage we decided to walk along the tram track to Porthtown (about one and a half mile) for dinner. We walked and walked and walked some more. Eventually we asked a runner how far it was to Porthtown and said about two miles, in the opposite direction! He described how to get to a pub that was further along the track, but he didn't say that it was still nearly a mile! We eventually cut through a caravan site and asked some more people. We were actually quite close, but we had to cross the A30 and were on a road that we had driven down earlier in the day when we were trying to get back to Portraeth. We left the cottage at 6:45 and it had taken us one and a half hours. We left the pub at five past eight and got back to the cottage at ten past nine (we walked faster on the way back).</p>
        <p>Friday 3rd July</p>
        <p>A day doing not very much at all. We went to a 'park' not far from here, but it was closed, we think because of travellers who had set up camp there. Then we tried a cyder farm, but we could not eat our own food there, so we came back to the cottage for lunch and then went to some shops (M&amp;S and Next) to get Rowan a new dress and Paul a belt, plus some food for this evening. I took P&amp;K to a pub in Porthtowan where they ate and were hoping to meet friends. Then I collected them later. Meanwhile we entertained Rowan and put her to bed, eventually.</p>
        <p>Saturday 4th July</p>
        <p>Another dry, quite sunny, breezy, but interesting and enjoyable day, our last in Cornwall. P, K &amp; R were going to the wedding that was the reason we came here in the first place. So we left them at the cottage just before lunch and headed for East Pool mine, a National Trust disused tin/copper mine. Access to the main part was via the Morrisons car park! The mine had suffered a roof fall and so the original mine entrance was abandoned and a new one built from the other end of the 'load'. This was in 1921, but the mine closed after the war. We then went on to Carn Brea to see the monument, castle (folly) and view. We can see the monument and castle from the cottage. The steward at East Pool dew us a map, which was very helpful. We got back in time to have a chat with Victoria. The poor WiFi just about held up. Then we packed and walked down the tram track to the Basset Arms for dinner. We were home before the others returned from the wedding.</p>
        <p>Sunday 5th July</p>
        <p>It took us surprisingly little time to pack everything into the cars and set off. P&amp;K left first and we took back the keys and left the cottage at about 9:30. It was raining when we left and during the first part of the journey (most of Cornwall and Devon) we had torrential rain. Luckily the weather then improved and it was sunny and dry for the rest of the journey. After a number of stops, including lunch in the Dorchester Tesco car park again, we got home at a quarter to five. We had time to get most things sorted out before P&amp;K arrived. We then simply cooked poached eggs and chips for dinner!</p>
        <p>Monday 6th July</p>
        <p>In spite of a slightly disturbed night's sleep, we were up quite early. Angela had washing on before we collected Sam from the cattery just after 9:30 and then went to Dad's to fill his pill box, change his bed and put on his washing. He didn't need any more food before Thursday, so we went on to Sainsbury's to do our own shopping. We then ate our main meal at lunchtime so that P&amp;K could go to Glenn's for six. They walked to Bay's after lunch while I downloaded the holiday photos, constructed an album and did a lot of updating of software on the Mac and the iPad and while Angela went to a church meeting. For some reason the new version of iTunes does not have Photos in its list of sources for photos to download to the iPad!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 7th July</p>
        <p>Today was the day for getting Dad and Bay around to have dinner with P, K &amp; R. Luckily P&amp;K were going shopping this morning and so they picked up Dad on their way home before lunch. I picked up Bay at three o'clock, but she wasn't ready until just after 3:30! During the morning I did the weekly and monthly accounts and modified my tank level simulation. Before dinner we showed them photos of our holiday, then cooked and ate dinner, before taking them home at 9:30.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 8th July</p>
        <p>P&amp;K packed this morning, had an early lunch and left at midday. They should get home at about nine o'clock our time. This afternoon I went to Hangleton junior school to help run a Barefoot workshop with Mick Landmann. I realised as I drove there that I had helped run a STEM session there last year. We had about 22 staff at the workshop and it seemed to go well.</p>
        <p>Thursday 9th July</p>
        <p>Since we had stocked up Bay's and Dad's larders before our holiday, the lists were quite small this week and we were finished a little earlier than usual. After lunch, Angela went to Bay's, I booked the MG into Cripps for the brakes (and other things) to be looked at and backed-off all the brakes. However, after I had takenk it for my standard run, the brakes were still binding!</p>
        <p>Friday 10th July</p>
        <p>It was a beautifully sunny day, with light, but gusty winds. This morning Angela went off to buy food for the lunch club. After lunch we took most of this down to the church kitchen. Meanwhile, I fitted the Octagon badge to the MG and charged the Cub's batteries.later in the afternoon I went up to the flying field and gave the Cub three flights. I still have difficulty getting it to go straight on take-off, but at least I managed to land it safely, if not elegantly.</p>
        <p>Saturday 11th July</p>
        <p>Another fine day. We started with our usual walk to the newsagents at Beeding and then spent some time reading the paper before going outside. Before lunch I cut the grass in the front and cleared the weeds out of the gutter in the road. After lunch (and a bit of a snooze, since I am feeling very tired) I cut the back grass while Angela did some shredding and general tidying up. This evening I started building a web site about my MG.</p>
        <p>Sunday 12th July</p>
        <p>A relatively early start this morning. Angela was making jelly for her lunch club trifles as I left to go to the Goodwood motor circuit, where the Greenpower Goblin event was taking place. I spent the day helping on the IET stand (ours was the only stand), getting children to build electrical circuits, while Claire (from the IET in Stevenage) got them making LED torches. The electric cars that the children had built (from kits) were very good. I left at 8:30 and got home at 4:45. This evening we spoke to both Paul et all and Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 13th July</p>
        <p>It seemed to drizzle on and off for most of the day. After taking Angela to the church with her trifles I did some more to my TC web page before going to Dad's. There I helped him turn over his bed cloths and had lunch with him. When I got back I did some more to the web site and after tea went to the WSMGOC meeting at Worthing Rugby Club.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 14th July</p>
        <p>Firstly this morning I collected together the props that I need for the STEM event tomorrow and checked my slides and simulation. Then I did some sewing. I fixed the bottom edge of the hood of the MG to the extensions that has the 'lift-the-dot'. I also tacked down some stitching that was coming away. I also found a loose bolt on one of the headlights and so dismantled the light and tightened the bolt. We had saved a couple of plastic bottles and I cut holes in their bottoms and fitted them over the bird feeder pole. Later we had a call from Bay who was having trouble with her watering hose! So we walked there, did her watering and walked back.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 15th July</p>
        <p>Angela went off walking this morning while I didn't really do anything until I prepared and ate lunch (early) and left for Dorothy Stringer School in Brighton. They were running late, so I had plenty of time to set up. However, the four sessions (of 20 minutes each) were hard going, but the overall scheme seemed to work reasonably well. When I got home we walked around to Bay's to borrow her car. We watered her pots and Angela compiled her shopping list.</p>
        <p>Thursday 16th July</p>
        <p>Another morning spent tidying files and e-mail while Angela went to Dad's and on to Holmebush to do the week's shopping. Again I had an early lunch and went off to Dorothy Stringer School, using Bay's car. The workshops with today's groups worked quite well. On the way back I called into Dad's to fill his pill box. When I got home, Jamie the gardener and his mate were trimming the confer trees in the front. When they had finished we took Bay's shopping to her, in her car, did some watering and walked home.</p>
        <p>Friday 17th July</p>
        <p>Quite a varied day today. We started by taking Sam to the vet for her annual injection and check-up. She was very good and seems to be in good health. Then Angela went to Steyning while I started cataloging the parts that have been bought for the MG since its return to the UK. I will then have a better view of what has been replaced and how much has already been spent. At twenty past four I left to drive to Plumpton College, where I had been invited to a wine tour and tasting for UoB volunteers. We were shown the small 'student's' vineyard which has lots of varieties. A French student explained what had to be done to the vines throughout the year. Then we were shown where they make wine and the process was explained for still, sparkling and red wines. We then sampled some of the wines that they make and some of the cheeses that are made at the college. It was a good evening, with about 26 people there. I got back a little after 7:30.</p>
        <p>Saturday 18th July</p>
        <p>Being Saturday we started the day with a walk to the Beeding newsagents. Then, while Angela went to the library, I did the weekly accounts (including checking against the bank statement), which was more extensive than usual duE to having bought theMG and been on holiday to Cornwall. I followed that by completing the catalogue of parts bought for the MG. by the previous two owners. Between them they spent over &#163;7,500 on parts. I assume that they did the work themselves. After lunch I drove the MG to Dad's to cut his grass. The car still seemed to 'roll' as I arrived at Dad's, but the brakes were definitely binding when I got home. Angela then cycled to Bay's to help water her plants, while I started preparing dinner.</p>
        <p>Sunday 19th July</p>
        <p>We walked as usual on a Sunday morning to the newsagents. Then, while Angela went to church, I repaired the pergola (luckily it was only the screws that had rotted over the past 17 years) and the bird nest box. I also measured the diagonals on the chassis of the MG. to do this I used a plumb bob to project points on the chassis on to the ground, marking them with chalk, and measured between the marks. I had read that the two measurements should be with a quarter of an inch of each other. However, I estimate that my measurements were only accurate to within plus or minus a quarter of an inch. Since the two measurements were within half an inch of each other I was happy. After lunch I concocted a device to measure the camber angle and then the castor angle. I measured the first, on both sides, as 2.5 degrees. It is stated as being 3 degrees, so again I was happy, since my measuring method was quite crude. For the castor angle the measure is even more prone to error. However, I measured 5.6 degrees on one side and 6.2 degrees on the other. For the TC, the castor angle should be 5.5 degrees if tapers are fitted and 8 degrees if not. I can't see any taper shims, but I got reasonable consistency, even if the error is likely to be large. Before we came in to prepare dinner I pruned the large apple tree, removing all this year's shoots. It was hard work with a heavy ladder and climbing the tree. While we were preparing dinner we spoke with Paul and while eating it we spoke with Victoria. After dinner I phoned Dad and sent Victoria details of their new Halifax cards.</p>
        <p>Monday 20th July</p>
        <p>This morning I started decorating the inner hall. At least I pulled off the top layer of the wallpaper. After lunch I went over to Dad's to help him change his bed and put on his washing. I also sold the rowing machine and updated my TC web site to include my measurements of the steering geometry.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 21st July</p>
        <p>A lot of my day was spent stripping the base of the wallpaper from the inner hall. There is now just the lobby at the end to strip. Before starting I popped round to Terry's to look at his garage doors. He is having problems opening and closing them. We found that one of the wheels has a chunk broken out of it that makes it fall off the rail. He can open and close the door, but it does get stuck at a particular point. I also updated details of the TC on the T-Database and on the T-type Register. A reply from the latter said that in 1973 the car was owned by Ronald Durno in Trumbull, California. It seems that this was detailed in an early issue of the New England MG Register magazine. So I mailed someone there to see if they have any more details.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 22nd July</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI group, I finished stripping wallpaper in the inner hall. After lunch, Angela walked the wheelchair around to Bay's and took her to a nearby 'open' garden. Meanwhile I rubbed-down the walls and woodwork.</p>
        <p>Thursday 23rd July</p>
        <p>This morning started with Angela going to the health centre to get batteries for both her hearing aids and Bay's and to get some light bulbs for Bay from Bunces. So we were a little late setting off to do the weekly shop. Add to that the closure of the Bostal (with the sign half way up the hill) and it was quite late before we sat down in M&amp;S for a coffee. Consequently it was after three o'clock before we finished our lunch. Late yesterday I received a reply from the New England MG T Register. It seems that Ronald Durno, the owner of the TC in 1973, lived in Trumbull, Connecticut, not California! They also new that it had later been owned by a George Mayfield, of an unknown address and at an unknown date, but earlier than the early 90s. Today I managed to find an address for Ronald, who is 88, so I might write to him. Angela had taken Bay's shopping to her and I was about to start washing down the ceiling and walls when she came home saying that Bay's burglar alarm was sounding and they could not turn it off. So we went back and I disconnected what appeared to be a sounder on the wall, only to discover that it was actually a smoke detector that was sounding! She has two mains operated and connected smoke detectors and I had to unplug one to make the noise stop. Consequently we were late with dinner again.</p>
        <p>Friday 24th July</p>
        <p>Angela made another trip this morning to the health centre for an appointment with the audiologist. She now has a further appointment on 21st August to get new hearing aids. When she got home, in spite of the rain, we drove to Shoreham and got the bus to Brighton. We had planned to have lunch in Harry Ramsdens, but there was a queue, with an estimated waiting time of half an hour! So we walked back through the Lanes and ended up in M&amp;S for lunch. Then we went into the Churchill Centre, heading for Lakeland. We bought a new (and smaller) bread maker. Then we found Millets and bought two light-weight cagoules before getting the bus back to Shoreham.</p>
        <p>Saturday 25th July</p>
        <p>Angela spent all morning helping at a coffee morning at the church. She had made the cakes yesterday. Meanwhile I went to the newsagents at Beeding and posted my letter to Connecticut. Then I did the weekly accounts and washed the ceiling, walls and woodwork of the inner hall, filling the worse bits after lunch. I also checked that the grease nipple on the lower king pin bush would let grease through it.</p>
        <p>Sunday 26th July</p>
        <p>We had a slightly extended walk to the newsagents this morning since they had sold out of Telegraphs. So we went on to the garage. While Angela went to church I (read the paper) and then started putting 'basecoat' on the walls of the inner hall, finishing it after lunch. Later we spoke to Paul and then Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 27th July</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to Bay's and to Steyning, I did some filling of the walls and undercoated the woodwork in the main part of the inner hall. After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 28th July</p>
        <p>We had a relatively early start by taking the MG to Cripps in Storrington. The brakes were binding badly by the time we got there. They have ordered a new master cylinder from NTG, which should arrive tomorrow. They also could not get grease into the king pin, and think that the bush is not properly aligned. There is nothing that can be done without dismantling the king pin and replacing the bushes. They also think that the steering is fine. A little on the heavy side, probably due to the steering box bearing being tightened down too much. But loosening the adjustment is likely to result in more slack in the steering. I finished the undercoating of woodwork in the inner hall before lunch and afterwards joined Angela in the garden. She re-made the compost heap near the shed and I pruned the fig and strimmed under the front trees and various bits of grass in the back. I also cleared the rest of the gutter in the road outside. Later I took a photo of my RC 'starter kit' and made up an advertisement for the SRFC Flypaper.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 29th July</p>
        <p>A fairly slow start to the day. After showering I sent an e-mail to the editor of the SRFC Flypaper with my advertisement for a 'starter kit'. I also included a photo of my Cub. I then started painting gloss on the woodwork of the inner hall. Meanwhile, Angela went off for a beach party (at someone's beach hut at Shoreham Beach). Mid afternoon I went to the health centre to see a dermatologist about the spot on my scalp. She froze several spots of solar keratosis. She also looked at the red blotch on my shoulder and said that it was a superficial cancer. She will arrange for me to go to Haywards Heath to have PDT to remove it. Afterwards I did some more painting.</p>
        <p>Thursday 30th July</p>
        <p>Shopping day again. We took Dad to M&amp;S for coffee before doing the shopping. After a late lunch we took Bay's shopping to her. I tried to clean her smoke detector, but it still sounds all the time. I also removed a blocked bolt on her bathroom door. When we got home there was a message from Cripp's saying that the MG is ready to collect. We agreed that we would collect it in the morning. I did a little more searching for a plan for a DH Tiger Moth of a suitable scale.</p>
        <p>Friday 31st July</p>
        <p>Quite a busy day. After showering we went to Storrington to collect the MG. the brake master cylinder had been replaced and Dot 4 Girling brake fluid used. When we got home Angela went to Steyning and I did some more gloss painting. After lunch, Angela went to Bay's to help her sort out the contents of some of the boxes that still have not been unpacked. I did some more painting and then took my Cub up to the flying site. I only managed two, rather erratic flights before the batteries were too low. When I got home I finished the gloss painting.</p>
