        <p>Friday 1st May</p>
        <p>May Day already! Angela went to Steying this morning, then called into the church (tomorrow is the craft fair) and went on to Bay's, where she spent longer than intended, as usual. I replied to my electron microscope man and dealt with other e-mail. After lunch I drove to North Chailey to view a restored MG TC. It is very fine, but very expensive. Meanwhile Angela went back to the church to help set up for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Saturday 2nd May</p>
        <p>Angela headed of to the church while I went to buy a paper. I joined her at 10:30 when the craft and hobbies fair started. So, until two o'clock, while Angela prepared lunches I sold tickets for them. After we had eaten our lunches I looked around the fair (there really was not a lot to see) and then came home. I only read the paper and played the piano (and nodded off) before Angela got home. While we had a light tea I got Angela to watch the 'For the love of cars' episode on the restoration of a TC. She is still not convinced that buying one is a good thing to do. Prior to that I e-mailed Terry Bone to ask if he had any idea why his TC has a gap between the rear of the running boards and the rear wings.</p>
        <p>Sunday 3rd May</p>
        <p>Following a walk to the Beeding newsagents, I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly and monthly accounts whilst Angela went to church. After lunch we went to Dad's to 'turn over' his bed and have a cup of tea with him. I also showed him the video clips that I took at Paul's barn and some photos of Victoria's house in the middle of its 'reconfiguration'. When we got home we spoke to Paul/Rowan and then Victoria/Austin while we cooked in the kitchen. Angela made a lemon drizzle cake and a trifle for tomorrow's craft and hobbies fair. Victoria told us that the scan she had may have shown up the presence of abiotic bands! She is going to have a higher resolution scan so that this possibility can be checked.</p>
        <p>Monday 4th May</p>
        <p>A repeat of Saturday except that the sun was shining this morning and more people decided to have lunch at the Craft and Hobbies Fair. Again, Angela helped prepare the lunches and I sold the tickets. When I got home I cut the front grass. I should have started cutting the back, but it was spitting with rain, so I didn't try. But it didn't rain until later, after Angela got home.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 5th May</p>
        <p>It's difficult to work out what I've been doing today! I replied to my electron microscope speakers and sent the arrival instructions for the cottage in Cornwall to Paul. I then seemed to spend most of the day going through the Barefoot slides and looking at their website in preparation for tomorrow's workshop. It seems that we will have ten staff attending, so I copied a few more feedback forms. Then I started cutting out the fake engines that will be glued on to the Cub's cowl. Meanwhile, Angela went down to Steyning and worked in the garden. It was very windy.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 6th May</p>
        <p>Angela went walking this morning, but came back early because she was very wet. I did some more cutting out of fake engine parts for the Cub and went to the dentist to have a crown stuck back. It seems that the root of the tooth that is still in the gum is both rotting and fractured! Sounds expensive. Later in the afternoon I went to the model shop on the way to Lancing College Prep School to run a Barefoot workshop with Julian Bond. After dinner I had a FaceTime call with Dave Hartley about our Barefoot workshop next week.</p>
        <p>Thursday 7th May</p>
        <p>Shopping day again, and Dad came with us again. After lunch I cut the back grass and moved the mower back into the shed. I also got an e-mail from Terry Bone about another 1948 TC that he has for sale. It also turned out that the Coy's TC was made in 1947!</p>
        <p>Friday 8th May</p>
        <p>Another quiet day. The British Gas service engineer was here at about 8:45 to service the boiler. Meanwhile, Angela went down to Steyning, before working in the garden. I spent most of the morning cutting and trimming the fake engines for the Cub. I spent some time trying to get the yellow paint can to spray more paint on to the cowl. Later in the afternoon I glued the parts on to the cowl; very fiddly. After lunch I joined Angela in the garden, tidied the canes in the shed and then put up some canes for the runner beans and sweet peas. Before we had dinner we had a short video call with Rowan on her birthday.</p>
        <p>Saturday 9th May</p>
        <p>Following our walk to the newsagents, just before I was about to join Angela in the garden, it started raining. So I did the accounts! This took the rest of the morning, but it brightened up after lunch so that I could clear the gutter on the side by the wood. Then I cut down brambles and ivy that were growing over from the wood. We ate dinner at lunchtime, since we went to a Music Society concert at the Steyning Centre. We took Bay.</p>
        <p>Sunday 10th May</p>
        <p>I went to buy a paper on my own this morning since Angela went to a church gathering at Ashurst. Then I checked the flat tyre on the wheelchair. I could not find any puncture. So I put it back and then cleaned and oiled (and pumped up the tyres of) the bikes. This afternoon Angela worked in the garden while I painted the fake cylinder heads on the fake engines on the Cub. I started pruning a 'dead' bush when the children called. So we spoke to Victoria and then to Paul</p>
        <p>Monday 11th May</p>
        <p>This morning I went over to Dad's to help him change his bed and do his washing. I also cut his grass and helped him trim his box hedges before cooking some dinner for the two of us. Meanwhile, Angela went to help with the lunch club. This afternoon I sold the chaise langue and started painting yellow around the windshield of the Cub. We also had a quick call with Austin, who was fast asleep when we called. He wasn't exactly awake when we finished, but we wished him a happy birthday.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 12th May</p>
        <p>Angela made one of her frequent trips to Steyning while I did a little more painting around the windshield of the Cub. Then we went to Bay's to do one or two jobs. We had agreed to go at eleven, but she was still not out of bed! However, we managed to get away before 12:30. So we had an early lunch and Angela went to her WI committee meeting. I again drove to North Chailey to see another of Terry Bone's TCs. It was disappointing. He was asking &#163;34,750 for a 15 year-old restoration, which is showing its age. The undersides of the front wings and running boards were rusting and on one wing was coming through the top surface! The seats had been fixed to the floor, rather than on runners, but we're not back far enough. Also, we could not get both sides of the hood on to the windscreen at the same time! And the hood was very grubby and a bit frayed.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 13th May</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went walking, I finished painting around the windshield of the Cub and cut out the two flashes to go along the side. After lunch Angela put weed/feed on the grass and I went to Hove to help run a Barefoot workshop with Dave Hartley. It seemed to go well.</p>
        <p>Thursday 14th May</p>
        <p>Shopping day again, and Dad came with us. We were quite early, so we did the shopping in M&amp;S before we stopped for coffee. We got very wet on the way back to the car. In fact, it rained for most of the day. After lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her as usual and I checked e-mail and added the flashes to the side of the Cub. In the evening I experimented with using Scratch to set up a simulation of filling (and emptying) tank for use in a STEM careers event.</p>
        <p>Friday 15th May</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning and on to Bay's (to take her ham to her that we forgot to take yesterday) while I e-mailed Andy Latham at Dorothy Springer school and completed a survey from UoB Philanthropy about a 'thank you' event for alumni donors/volunteers. Then we cycled (yes cycled) to Shoreham airport for lunch, and then cycled back. Angela then worked in the front garden and I measured the floor area of the house and then cut out (not very well) some black numbers for the rudder of the Cub.</p>
        <p>Saturday 16th May</p>
        <p>As usual on Saturday we walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. I experimented with the idea of building a tank control simulation using Scratch. The idea is to use this for the Dorothy Springer event. Angela spent the rest of the morning working in the garden and the afternoon working in the church garden while I cut the box hedge and raised the base of the big conifer in the back garden.</p>
        <p>Sunday 17th May</p>
        <p>Another walk to Beeding, but this time Angela went straight on to church. I spent most of the day mounting a push button, a switch and a potentiometer in pots for use in the tank control simulation. I connected them up to an Arduino and used the Scratch to Arduino software to get the system working. We also spoke with Victoria and Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 18th May</p>
        <p>This morning I went to Dad's to help him turn over his bedding and show him some photos of Rowan and Austin. I then went into Worthing to buy a new inner tube for the wheel chair and some wire and a box for my tank level simulation. After lunch I fitted the inner tube and started making the cables to use between the Arduino box and the sensor pots. In the evening I went to an IET committee meeting in Crawley. I also had an email from Terry Bone saying that he had got the prices wrong (too high) and was wondering if I was still interested!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 19th May</p>
        <p>I seemed to spend most of the day making two cables for the tank control simulation and wiring them up. I also introduced a real tank as the background to the simulation. After lunch Angela took Bay to M&amp;S to buy clothes. Then I went to Sussex University to an IET talk on future cities. It was not a good talk, made worse by the food not arriving. The speaker seemed to be promoting a technical solution to a problem that had not been defined!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 20th May</p>
        <p>In the morning Angela went walking with the WI group, while I did some more on my tank control sensor interface, mainly working out a way to mount the Aduino in the box. I spent most of the afternoon cutting the front and rear grass. It was long because Angela had put 'weed &amp; feed' on it and it had to be left at least four days either side without mowing. In the evening we went to the Steyning Centre to see a film; The Theory of Everything. It was very good.</p>
        <p>Thursday 21st May</p>
        <p>Once again on a Thursday, the morning was spent shopping at Holmbush (with Dad). Then Angela spent most of the afternoon at Bay's. I continued to work on my container for an Arduino UNO, plus connectors and associated circuitry. I also found that Coy's Ascot auction results did not contain mention of their TC, implying that it was not sold. To Angela this means that no one wants to buy such rubbish! To me it is an opportunity to buy it for a good price. But Angela is still anti the whole idea.</p>
        <p>Friday 22nd May</p>
        <p>Before lunch today we divided to take the old spin-dryer to the tip and call into Rogers Farm garden centre to get wall basket liners and compost. Unfortunately, the traffic on the A27 was very bad and so it was quite late before we got back for lunch. After lunch I lined the baskets and then tested my tank control simulation. I also started documenting the tank sensors and simulation.</p>
        <p>Saturday 23rd May</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to the Beeding newsagents I did the accounts (for two weeks). I then strimmed under the front trees and cut the back hedge while Angela worked in the garden. After lunch I completed the documentation for my Scratch tank control simulation.</p>
        <p>Sunday 24th May</p>
        <p>A walk to the paper shop, followed by looking up flights and hotels for our visit to California. After lunch I cut out the second set of rudder numbers for the Cub while Angela worked in the garden. Then we spoke to Victoria and then Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 25th May</p>
        <p>Bank holiday Monday. But not really any different to any other day. Except that it was the Steyning Country Fair. Angela went down to the church just before ten to help make and serve tea/coffee/sandwiches/cakes. The weather was fine so they set up tables in the front garden. The bus stop by the church was the start and finish for the open-top bus tour, so the 'cafe' did quite well. While Angela was working there, I sent an e-mail to Alex at Coys and then went to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and cut his grass. I took my lunch with me. When I got home I walked down to the church to have a cup of tea and then walked along the High Street. Things were just starting to pack up. On my way back I looked in at the art exhibitions in Church Street and at the Steyning Centre. After dinner I booked our flights to California in October and made a list of the other things we need to do.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 26th May</p>
        <p>Angela had her hair cut this morning and went to Bay's this afternoon. She seemed to unpack cardboard boxes and put most of it back in the same boxes! Meanwhile, I checked the expiry of our ESTAs and booked a hotel near San Fransisco airport for our first night. I also applied the small letters to the rudder of the Cub and cut out one set of letters for the wing.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 27th May</p>
        <p>A relatively early start (well, up at 7 o'clock) saw me head off to George's house to spend the morning working with him and Hamish on the ASI workshop. We worked through the high-speed camera part of the workshop. Meanwhile Angela went walking with her WI group. I got home at one o'clock, but Angela did not get home until half past. After lunch Angela did some work in the garden and I completed the calculations from the morning session and drew out the second set of wing letters for the Cub.</p>
        <p>Thursday 28th May</p>
        <p>We were up a little later than usual, but our Thursday shopping trip seemed to get back on track. Dad came with us and we started with coffee, shopped in M&amp;S and then in Tesco. We were home by about two o'clock. Angela then took Bay's shopping to her while I started cutting out the second set of letters for the Cub's wings. However, I was distracted by a half-hour telephone call from a house insurance agent! Late in the day I got a reply from Alex at Coys. He says that they have dismissed offers higher than my &#163;18,000, but that they would be prepared to accept an offer of between 22 and 23 thousand.</p>
        <p>Friday 29th May</p>
        <p>I e-mailed Alex at Coys, saying that 22K was a possibility and saying that next week I could only get there on Monday morning. However, I did not get a reply. Angela went to Steyning and to Bay's and I completed 'decorating' the Cub. I also started installing on Windows everything needed for the Scratch with Arduino projects.</p>
        <p>Saturday 30th May</p>
        <p>Our usual walk to the newsagents was followed by doing the accounts while Angela worked in the garden. She continued to work in the garden after lunch and I cut the grass, in the front and the back.</p>
        <p>Sunday 31st May</p>
        <p>I had a wet walk to the newsagents while Angela went to church. Otherwise, I started looking at setting up the Scratch to Arduino interface on Windows. As usual, we spoke to both Victoria and Paul.</p>
