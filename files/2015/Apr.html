        <p>Wednesday 1st April<br />
        Another day where I didn't venture outside! However, I did turn my hand to vacuuming (the dining room, sitting room and hall) and cleaning tiles in the bathroom. Both quite tiring! Meanwhile, this morning Angela cooked the Easter biscuit dough that that she made yesterday and then went to table tennis this afternoon. I spoke to Terry Bone and he sent me photos of the 1948 MG TC that he has for sale. He is asking &#163;34,500 for it! I discovered that it has been brought back from California and found a lot of photos from when it was on sale there. I now just need to persuade Angela that we should go and look at it.</p>
        <p>Thursday 2nd April<br />
        Angela started the day by walking down to The butchers and Post Office in Steyning. Then we drove to Holmebush, where we started with coffee!. It was quite late by the time that we got to Dad's. After a late lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her while I walked down to the Co-op to buy some Horlicks for Dad, which I forgot to buy at Tesco this morning. The rest of the time was spent dealing with e-mail.</p>
        <p>Friday 3rd April<br />
        A quiet Good Friday. I collected Dad just after eleven o'clock and brought him back for lunch. Later in the afternoon we spoke briefly with Victoria (and Austin) and then, later still, with Paul (and Rowan). I then took Dad home about 7:30.</p>
        <p>Saturday 4th April<br />
        A relatively early start to take Dad to meet Alan at the Cobham services on the M25. We were there by 10:30 and got home, without Dad, just before 12:30. After lunch I did both the weekly and the monthly accounts. Meanwhile, Angela washed the car and I vacuumed out the inside. She then worked in the greenhouse and in the garden. I helped a little with some cutting down of buddleja that was coming over the fence from the wood.</p>
        <p>Sunday 5th April<br />
        In the morning, as usual on a Sunday morning, we walked to the newsagents in Beeding. I got a chance at least to start reassembling my RC prototype, although that was no more than clearing the desk and looking up how to power the ground station and plane modules. After lunch I persuaded Angela to let me pursue the purchase of an MG TC. So I e-mailed Terry Bone and Coys about viewing the cars they have for sale. Then, approaching three o'clock, I collected Bay. So we spent the rest of the afternoon, dinner and evening talking, until we decided to watch Indian Summers, when she fell asleep! Before dinner we did get a chance to talk firstly with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 6th April<br />
        Easter Monday, and a very fine, sunny day. We got up late, I had a shower while Angela put on some washing and then we went for a walk to the far side of Beeding to deliver an envelope (and buy some potatoes). We stopped at the Castle Hotel for a coffee. Very pleasant sitting outside (under cover), even if the coffee was not very hot. We got home just in time for lunch! Afterwards, while Angela worked in the garden, I glued the cord back on to Sam's scratching post (she must have very sharp claws) and prepared my IC trainer for flight. I also charged the two LiPo batteries for the Cub with the thought that the weather might be good enough tomorrow to go up to the flying site. I also replied to Terry Bone to suggest a time to view his TC. He is delivering one to Holland next week!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 7th April<br />
        Quite a momentous day really. However, it started gently with a walk into Steyning, actually to the pharmacist to get some treatment for fungal nail disease. Then I checked over the Cub before, after lunch, going to the flying site. After two flights with the trainer, Alan (Murray) and Les helped me check over the cub. The elevator was the wrong way round! Then I flew it, with Alan helping to set the trims. After six or seven minutes I landed it safely. Then I drove to Crawley for an IET talk on 'Cars, Cavities and the Cold War'.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 8th April<br />
        This morning I opened the drain cover on the patio for the first time for a long time. Luckily it was clear and the hole that had appeared in the flower bed next to the manhole was just a hole in the soil. Meanwhile I was putting my two LiPo batteries into storage mode. I also tried to widen the hole in the main former of the fuselage through which the battery passes and stuck back the Velcro strip that had pulled away. After lunch Angela went to table tennis from where I picked her up to go to Rogers Farm and then to B&amp;Q. We got back just in time for me to change and drive to Crawley to attend an IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Thursday 9th April<br />
        We did the shopping as usual, even though we only had a little to get for Dad. We took his shopping to his house and in the afternoon Angela took Bay's shopping to her, as usual. However, before we went shopping we both walked down to Steyning, me to go to the pharmacist to get something for my fungal nail disease and Angela to buy meat and vegetables and go to the library. I carried home her shopping.</p>
        <p>Friday 10th April<br />
        Angela went shopping for food for the lunch club on Monay while I did some quick vacuuming before Kate and Dick arrived. After a latish lunch we drove down to Shoreham Beach and walked to Beach Green and back. Then back home for dinner and talk.</p>
        <p>Saturday 11th April<br />
        Kate and Dick like to start the day gently, with tea in bed at about 8 o'clock. So we left at about eleven and drove East to Batemans, where we started with a brief look at the mill and then had lunch! After looking around the house (and having afternoon tea) we moved on to Birling Gap and hAd a.short walk up the hill. We got home at about seven after a pleasant drive along the 259 coast road through Newhaven and Brighton.</p>
        <p>Sunday 12th April<br />
        Another leisurely start to the day. Kate and Dick left at about ten o'clock and we walked down to the shop in Beeding to buy a paper (the newsagents was being refitted). After lunch we went over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and cut his grass. When we got home we talked firstly to Victoria and then to Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 13th April<br />
        After driving Angela down to the church with her things for the lunch club I sent my notes on an award process/criteria to the Sussex IET LN and caught up with the weekly accounts, including reconciling them with the bank statement. After that I compiled notes on the things to inspect/ask about the TC tomorrow. I still can't persuade Angela to show any interest. After a latish lunch I cleared e-mail and updated the Aduino IDE on the laptop. I also updated my RC blog about the maiden flight of my Cub.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 14th April<br />
        A beautiful, sunny day, but I didn't go out! I had intended going to Terry Bone's to see a TC, but he e-mailed last night to say that the garage had not been able to put it through its MOT and so the car would not be available today. Perhaps it failed and needs work doing on it! So I have arranged to go on Saturday morning. While Angela went down to Steyning I mailed Julian at Sussex about his electron microscope talk and sent a suggested abstract to Tim Bruton for his PV talk. Then, after lunch and while Angela was at a WI committee meeting, I started looking at my RC project. It took most of the afternoon to simply get it working as it was almost a year ago. A new version of the Arduino IDE reset the processor type to 16MHz rather than 8MHz. So I got some funny effects on the serial monitor and the servo driving. I also corrected a couple of errors and added a test that the packet had come from the plane. But most of the errors are timeouts, so it had no noticeable effect.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 15th April<br />
        This morning I chased up Jules Thorpe and sent a suggested abstract to Tim Brunton.. Jules has pulled out, so I have e-mailed Dr Salvage at Brighton again. I also charged the batteries and adjusted the controls on my Cub so as to remove the trims on the elevator and rudder. However, when flying it this afternoon it still seems to need some rudder trim. It was a very fine day and there were lots of people up at the site. I had three flights. It is very difficult to make it taxi in a straight line, so takeoff is difficult, but landing seems easier. However, on my final flight the plane started making a noise. So I landed hurriedly to find that the motor had come lose! When I got home and took off the cowl I found that the motor mount had broken!<br />
        Angela worked in the garden this morning and, before lunch, I helped dig out some compost.</p>
        <p>Thursday 16th April<br />
        Angela started the day by walking down to Steyning, actually to get batteries for her hearing aids, while I had a shower. We then went to Dad's to get his shopping list before going to Holmebush. After lunch, while Angela went to Bay's, I put some silicone sealant around the window frames. I also removed the motor from my Cub. But I don't know how best to make a new mount. This evening I mailed more people about providing a speaker on electron microscopy.</p>
        <p>Friday 17th April<br />
        This morning Angela set off to catch the bus to Worthing, only to find that they now only run on Tuesday's, Wednesday's and Thursday's. And then only one bus per day! So she came back for the car and drove to Shoreham, catching the Coastliner from there. When she returned, she had a new jacket (to wear at the Buckingham Palace garden party) and lots of small presents for Rowan and Austin. Meanwhile I went to the hygienist and worked through the Barefoot workshop slides, adjusting the notation for who does what. After lunch I added some white silicone to the windows, having repaired the translucent silicone yesterday. I also heard from Terry Bone that his TC needed a new brake cylinder and so would not be available to see tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Saturday 18th April<br />
        A walk to the newsagents; the weekly accounts; gluing the Cub's motor mount back together and cutting the front and read grass. A normal sort of Saturday.</p>
        <p>Sunday 19th April<br />
        I walked to Steyning this morning with Angela. She went to church and I went on to buy a paper and some flowers for Angela. I then spent the rest of the morning checking travel in Rotterdam. After lunch we went to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes and join him for a cup of tea. When we got home we talked with Victoria and Austin and then with Paul (Rowan was not in the mood to talk). Brandon, having removed all the floor tiles containing asbestos, was about to start removing the bubble layer on the ceilings, which also contain asbestos!</p>
        <p>Monday 20th April<br />
        I walked to Beeding, with Angela, to get a haircut, but the barber's was closed! Angela was delivering posters, so I walked on with her, we bought some rolls for lunch and stopped for coffee at the Baptist Church cafe. This all took most of the morning, but it was a fine day. After lunch Angela went to her WI 60th anniversary meeting while I finished strengthening the motor mount of the Cub. I also read about the evolution of the dashboard on TCs and checked the use of my new debit card for regular payments.i also printed and signed the patent form that Mark sent, but the scanner would not work when I tried to scan it to send it back.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 21st April<br />
        Firstly I went down to Beeding to the hairdressers. I was a little late since there was a queue! By the time that I got home and showered it was time to go to Baloos for lunch. It was very good. When we got home we walked down to Steyning to buy some euros. Later I drove to Falmer to an IET talk on 'Engineers without borders'.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 22nd April<br />
        We brought shopping day forward since we are off to Rotterdam tomorrow. It also coincided with Dad's appointment at the Dermatology department at Southlands. So we dropped Angela at Tescos and went on to Southlands. Dr Ali froze a couple of spots on his temple and neck, but we were out and back at Holmebush before Angela had finished. After a late lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her and I sorted out things to take with us. Then we took Sam to the cattery.</p>
        <p>Thursday 23rd April<br />
        We got up early this morning and drove to Gatwick. We arrived in good time, which was lucky, since it took me a long time to get through security. I inadvertently left my keys in my pocket and so was searched, thoroughly! Then my iPad was checked. Anyway, we arrived at Schiphol a little early, bought some filled rolls, added money to our OV-chip cards and caught the train to Rotterdam. We were earlier than planned, so we had a coffee (while waiting for Paul to join us) and then caught the metro to Capelsebrug where Krista collected us. Rowan was asleep in the car until we arrived at their apartment block. We spent the rest of the afternoon playing with Rowan.</p>
        <p>Friday 24th April<br />
        We finally saw Paul and Krista's barn today. After a walk in the forest, followed by cake and coffee at a cafe with a closed kitchen, we went to Achterbroek. It was a very fine day, so we spent quite a long time there, looking around the garden. Rowan played on the trampoline and the tyre swing and managed to fill her shoe with sand. We then went back to their flat for a cup of tea before walking to the supermarket and the fish stall on the market. We bought some cooked pieces of fish, which we ate in a soft bread roll.</p>
        <p>Saturday 25th April<br />
        We were up late this morning, which was fine since it was a grey, wet morning. Greet and Wim came over for coffee (and cake) and we had an early lunch. Then we went to Achterbroek ein to look in the upstairs of the barn. We had to climb a ladder to get up there. The thought of converting it is quite scary! From there we went to Greet's for coffee before going to a pancake house in Krimpen an der Issel. When we got back to Paul's flat we spoke to Victoria and Austin before reading Rowan her bedtime stories.</p>
        <p>Sunday 26th April<br />
        We had quite a lazy day today in Krimpen an de Lek. We got up late and played games with Rowan. After lunch we went for a walk around some parkland on the edge of Krimpen, just a few minutes from their flat. Meanwhile, Krista went to her sister-in-law's baby shower. At six o'clock Paul drove us to Schiphol airport. We had a hot roll and some fruit at a kiosk near the departure gate and caught our 08:55 flight to Gatwick We arrived home to a dark and not very warm house at 10:30 UK time.</p>
        <p>Monday 27th April<br />
        This morning I downloaded the photos from the weekend and then we went over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and show him the photos. After lunch Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and then on to the garden centre. Meanwhile I did the weekly accounts and did some more research on Coys' TC.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 28th April<br />
        Angela started the day with a walk to Steyning while I had a shower. Then, at ten past eleven, we drove to Richmond and had lunch in Pembroke Lodge. We then went to Coys and I inspected their TC. It seemed to be in excellent mechanical condition, but the bodywork is very shabby. I spent about an hour crawling over and under it. On our way back we stopped at Denbies for a cup of tea and got home at 5:30.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 29th April<br />
        A much lazier day today, at least for me. Angela did some vacuuming and went around to Bay's for when someone from the DHP called; just to check before the Queen sends her a birthday card! Angela then got quite wet walking home. Meanwhile I refitted the motor in the Cub, although I did clean the filters in the vacuum cleaner first.after lunch I cleared some e-mail, looked at my income over the past few years and combined the video clips (both of them) from the weekend into a little film.</p>
        <p>Thursday 30th April<br />
        Dad finally decided to come shopping with us today. This was really because he wanted to buy some flowers.to put around the house, since it was Mum's birthday. As usual we started with coffee in M&amp;S and then, luckily, the lists were short. Even so, we were quite late home for lunch. Angela then spent quite some time with Bay, while I caught up with e-mail and spray painted the decorative bits for the Cub.</p>
