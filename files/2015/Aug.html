        <p>Saturday 1st August</p>
        <p>This morning we walked to Steyning rather than Beeding, since we wanted to go to Bunces and the bookshop. When we got home I phoned someone in Brighton who has a TA. He offered help and for me to visit him. Then it took me the rest of the morning (and part of the afternoon) to do the weekly and monthly accounts and share dividend data. I then took the MG to Beeding to get some petrol. We then took the car to Dad's to meet up with Alan and Chris. I also downloaded a plan for a 50&quot; wingspan (1/7th scale) Tiger Moth. It is quite an old design, but might be suitable for conversion to electric power.</p>
        <p>Sunday 2nd August</p>
        <p>Following a walk to the Beeding newsagent I started putting white emulsion on the ceiling and walls. It took most of the day, on and off, to finish it, but tomorrow I can put the inner hall back together. Angela worked in the garden and we spoke to Paul (in his new/old cottage) and then Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 3rd August</p>
        <p>We were later getting to Dad's this morning than we had intended. Nevertheless we washed his dining room net curtains, changed his bed, did his washing and trimmed his box hedges before we left for a late lunch. After which I put the inner hall back together (apart from hanging the paintings) and experimented with multi-page print options for the Tiger Moth plans. I also investigated flights and trains to visit Paul, but the cattery is full during the whole of September. Later I phoned Stewart Penfound and arranged to visit him in Brighton on Friday.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 4th August</p>
        <p>After hanging the pictures in the inner hall (plus one in the back bedroom) I walked to Beeding to have my hair cut. Then, before lunch, I adjusted the brakes on the MG. After lunch I took the car for a test drive and added 10l of petrol. I then talked with Neil while he was working on his MGB before helping Angela in the garden by doing some shredding. We then went off to Holmbush to fill the Panda with petrol and buy some puddings for today and tomorrow. After dinner I worked out how to print my Tiger Moth plan to the right scale.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 5th August</p>
        <p>Quite an eventful day. This morning I looked up what I had done to use a digital thermometer with the Arduino and laptop so that I can document it on my projects web site. I also found that the laptop battery was completely flat, since I hadn't used it for a few weeks! Then we went off and collected Bay (who was in a panic because she had broken one of her hearing aids, which we fixed) and then Dad and took them to Chichester Theatre. We dropped them at the door and then parked the car in the WI offices. Then we had a sandwich and coffee before taking our places (on the back row) to see Mac &amp; Mabel. We all enjoyed it very much. We then brought them home for dinner. When we took Bay home her burglar alarm went off! Eventually, with the help of a neighbour, we removed the battery and the mains fuse and it stopped. Why it was activated when it has been off for so long, we have no idea. So finally we took Dad home as well.</p>
        <p>Thursday 6th August</p>
        <p>The telephone woke us at 6:25 this morning! It was the care line operator saying that Bay had fallen in the bathroom and could not get up. He said that paramedics were on the way. So we dressed quickly and went round. In fact she was sat on the toilet and could not send up! She was still in her day clothes (apart from her trousers). When we left her last night she had sat down and gone to sleep. As far as we can work it out, at about three o'clock she had decided to go to bed. But she got stuck on the toilet! It sounds as though she sat there for over three hours before pressing the button on her call system. We were able to easily get her up and she went to bed. So we cancelled the paramedics and waited a while before coming home for breakfast. Then, back to our usual schedule, we went to Dad's and took him to Holmebush for coffee and grocery shopping. We also borrowed the toilet frame for Bay to try. After lunch we went back to Bay's, made her something to eat, fitted a new bolt on the bathroom door and did numerous other jobs. Eventually we came home to make dinner. We hope that Bay is just recovering from her exertions yesterday.</p>
        <p>Friday 7th August</p>
        <p>Today was an MG day. I started by driving the TC to Stewart Penfound's in Brighton. This is the furthest that I have driven the car. He helped me adjust the headlights and showed me how to check gearbox and back axle oil levels. The journey there, on the A27, was a little frightening and it was difficult to keep my hat on. So I returned via the A270. This was better, even though there was a long queue of traffic going into Brighton. After lunch I removed the gearbox cover and extracted the gearbox dipstick. The hole in the cover is actually too high, and so the dipstick needs to be pushed down, distorting the cover, so as to fully insert it and get a true reading. Then I removed the floor in the tonneau area and topped up the oil in the rear axle.</p>
        <p>Saturday 8th August</p>
        <p>We unexpectedly started with a visit to Bay. She had phoned to say that she was not feeling well, so we went round. After talking to her for a while and giving her some breakfast she seemed to be much better. I came home to do the weekly accounts while Angela helped her get dressed. I also got my trainer plane and its associated kit ready to take it up to the flying club's fun day to try to sell it. I went up there after lunch, putting it together and leaving it in a marquee. I can collect it tomorrow afternoon. I then came home and took Angela to the Roger's Farm garden centre to buy some lavender plants. When we got back I started Angela' tax return.</p>
        <p>Sunday 9th August</p>
        <p>Apart from a walk to the Beeding newsagents, today was spent mainly in front of the computer. I started putting together a web page on interfacing a digital thermometer to an Arduino, but spent most of the time tracking down data for Angela's tax return. We also spoke with Victoria and Paul. Whilst talking with Victoria I went up to the flying site to collect my trainer, but found that it had been sold yesterday! A new member had bought it (for the asking price of &amp;75) and the guys had rigged up a buddy box. It was then used until quite late yesterday and again today. I gave five pounds to Paul Gladstone for the Air Ambulance collection.</p>
        <p>Monday 10th August</p>
        <p>This morning I went to Dad's while Angela went to Bay's and then to help at the lunch club. After cutting Dad's grass I came home for lunch and finished my web page on temperature measurement and plotting. Later in the afternoon I cut the front grass, but it started drizzling before I could start cutting the back grass. This evening I took the MG to Worthing Rugby Club for the WSMGOC quiz night. Our team came second (out of five) and then I drove home in the dark. The headlights give enough light on the road, but point to the right! So that was a 30 mile round trip and my first night-time drive.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 11th August</p>
        <p>Bay's new smoke detectors arrived shortly after breakfast this morning. So I walked round there with Angela and fitted them. We left just as her 'helper' arrived. I spent the morning sorting out e-mail and adding to my TC web page. After lunch, while Angela went to her WI quiz, I tried adjusting the headlight alignment on the MG, but as one side dips, the other goes up! After dinner I went to Nuthurst to the MGCC 'natter'. A slightly 'odd' collection of people.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 12th August</p>
        <p>Angela went walking this morning with her WI group while I sorted e-mail and then retired one of the headlights on the MG so as to make the dip work in the right direction. After lunch I mowed the back grass and started cutting the top of the laurel bush at the top of the garden. I also did a little more research into which RC transmitter to buy.</p>
        <p>Thursday 13th August</p>
        <p>We needed to start our shopping trip a little earlier this week since Angela had to be back in time to go to a funeral this afternoon. It had rained heavily over night and was still raining this morning. We started at Dad's, took him for coffee in M&amp;S, shopped there and then in Tesco. We tried to find him a new, light-weight rainproof jacket, but his waist is too large for the size that fits his arms. After lunch I completed my research on which RC transmitter to buy and read articles on removing the radiator on the MG so as to tackle the rust that I can see at the bottom.</p>
        <p>Friday 14th August</p>
        <p>Today mainly revolved around Bay. Angela went there this morning before going into Steyning. Then we both went back (on our bikes) just before lunch so as to meet up with Michael and sort out the documents for her car, which she was giving to him. Prior to going there I ordered a new transmitter and receiver. After a very late lunch Angela worked in the garden while I sorted out some e-mail and did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Saturday 15th August</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to Beeding to buy a paper, Angela went to Bay's (on her bike) and I bought our travel insurance for our trip to the U.S in October. After lunch we worked in the garden. I dug up some lavender bushes and cut a lot out of the top of the laurel bush, but am still less than half way! After a relatively early dinner Angela again went to Bay's to help her prepare her dinner... She has agreed that she needs someone to come in twice a day to give her help. So we started looking at the West Sussex care guide for suitable suppliers.</p>
        <p>Sunday 16th August</p>
        <p>The day started with Angela going to Bay's before going on to church and me walking to the Beeding newsagents. Today I had to get a Daily Mail for Dad as well as our own paper, since his local shop is being refurbished. I then advertised the bath taps and the tiles on Greencycle Adur, disposing of them both before the day was out. I also started looking up care service providers. After lunch we went to Dad's (in the MG) to change his bed and do his washing. When we got back, we spoke with Paul before dinner and Victoria after Angela had visited Bay again (complete with some rice pudding). Paul and Krista are thinking of getting a dog!</p>
        <p>Monday 17th August</p>
        <p>Angela.went to Bay's in the morning and again in the evening. In between I arranged for two care providers to call tomorrow to discuss what could be provided and when. At eleven o'clock, Bay phoned to say that she had woken in the chair to find that she had upset a mug of coffee down her. So we went round to help her. Earlier I fron edged up the new receiver and tested it before fitting it in the Cub.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 18th August</p>
        <p>Most of today revolved around Bay. Angela went round early and I went for 10:30 to meet with the supervisor from South Coast Care. We both went back to meet someone from AbiCare at 2:30. Later we asked SCC to provide care twice a day. They will call again around midday on Thursday and care provision will start on Monday. This morning I checked that my new transmitter moved all the controls in the right direction and set it up on the flight simulator. Later I started updating my RC web site.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 19th August</p>
        <p>A morning of doing odds and ends while Angela went to Bay's and then went walking with her WI group. I finished updating my RC web site about my transmitter upgrade, cleaned Angela's secateurs, disposed of old eggs and jars of stuff from Bay's and checked Angela's tax return. After lunch we went to Dad's and took him to do the weekly shop, a day early since I have to go to the dermatologist tomorrow. When we got home we cooked and ate before Angela went again to Bay's to cook her some dinner.</p>
        <p>Thursday 20th August</p>
        <p>We had a day out in Haywards Heath today. This morning, after going to Bay's, we went to the Dolphin clinic for me to have cream applied to the patch on my shoulder. We then walked into the town for coffee and bought a panini and eat them in a park near the clinic. I then went back to have the red light treatment and we were home by three o'clock. After an early dinner Angela went back to Bay's and I phoned Alan Sinclair and spoke to him about the TC. It turned out that he bought it from Terry Bone! When he found that he could not get behind the wheel, he sold it and an MGA to The Real Car Co. in South Wales in exchange for a Rolls Royce. I found it's photo on the RCC web site, but not on Bone's site.</p>
        <p>Friday 21st August</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Bay's and to Steyning I sent a few e-mail and tried to find more information about the MG. then we set off to Dial Post in the MG, meeting up with Hamish and Sue McNaughton and Simon and June Keeble. There were about twenty five interesting cars there in the sunshine for lunch. Afterwards we went back to Simon's for coffee and cake (Hamish and Sue were staying to play crocket) before we came home so that Angela could go to the audiologist to get new hearing aids. Before tea Angela went back to Bay's.</p>
        <p>Saturday 22nd August</p>
        <p>A sad day for Shoreham. A plane at the air show crashed on to the A27 and killed seven people. We did not know anything about it until Dad phoned, although we had noticed the police closed Annington Road, thought there had been an accident. After going to Bay's, Angela spent most of the day in the garden, until it was time to go to Bay's again. Meanwhile, I removed the bonnet of the MG (with a little help from Angela) and then removed the chrome radiator shell.</p>
        <p>Sunday 23rd August</p>
        <p>Angela again started her day by going to Bay's. And then went to church. Meanwhile I walked to the newsagents. Afterwards I did the weekly accounts and then continued to undo bits attached to the radiator of the MG. I now just have the stays to remove and then try to get the radiator out. After lunch we walked down to Steyning to have afternoon tea in the garden of a cottage in Church Street. Later we spoke to Victoria, before Angela again went to see Bay. While eating dinner we spoke to Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 24th August</p>
        <p>Since it was raining this morning we took our time getting ready. We then walked to Beeding to get a paper for Dad, who it turned out had got his neighbour to get him one! After an early lunch we took Bay to the dentist and then went over to Dad's. He had changed his bottom sheet, but not changed the pillows or quilt. In fact he only needed to turn the sheet and duvet over and switch the pillow cases. When we got home I managed to get the radiator out of the MG.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 25th August</p>
        <p>A slightly disjointed day today. We had agreed to take Phillip (from around the corner) to the health centre, which we did for his 11:40 appointment. So it wasn't really possible to do anything on the car before lunch. However, after lunch I reorganised things a little in the garage and moved the radiator on to the bench. I then spent the rest of the afternoon removing the bolts and cleaning the radiator with white spirit. I also e-mailed Stewart Penfound to see if he had any approach for un-sweating the solder joints. He replied later, saying that he had tried to clean up and paint the mounting bracket without removing it from the radiator. He thinks it too dangerous to try.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 26th August</p>
        <p>Rather than go walking (in the rain), the WI walking group met for coffee in Steyning! My rust remover crystals arrived this morning, so I tested it on a few small bolts. Not a lot seemed to be happening! However, once I had removed a strip of felt (or the remains of it) from between the radiator and the bracket, I discovered that one of the U-shaped elements on the bracket had rusted through on both sides, one was complete, but had come un-soldered from the radiator and the middle one had rusted through on one side, but was still soldered on the other. So there was only one side of one piece that needed to be un-soldered. This came away easily with a little heat from a blowtorch. So I was then able to put the bracket into the detox-C solution, in the hope that there is enough of it left to reuse. I also did a little cleaning at the front of the engine, deciding that the chassis cross-member does not need painting. I also decided that I should replace the engine mounts, since they are cracked and they are accessible while the radiator is out. While I was in the garage, Angela spent some time in the greenhouse, sheltering from the rain.</p>
        <p>Thursday 27th August</p>
        <p>Because of the A27 road closure we went to Lyons Farm (Sainsbury's) to do the weekly shop. After lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her and then took her to the chiropodist. Meanwhile I tried cleaning the radiator mounting bracket, but later discovered that I had not made the solution strong enough. I also compiled a list of parts that I want to buy from the Octagon Club. After dinner we went to Holmbush to collect a bird house that we had ordered online. When we got it home we found that the base was missing. So we took it back and exchanged it for one they had in the store. Then we wrapped it and put out our things for packing.</p>
        <p>Friday 28th August</p>
        <p>We got Sam to the cattery by 9:30 and set off from there for Badby. Since we were relatively early we stopped at Denbies winery at Dorking for coffee. However, when we got to the M25 the traffic was stationary! And it stayed 'stop/start' all the way around to Heathrow. We eventually go to Badby at ten to two! Four hours 20 minutes (including a half hour coffee stop) for a two and a half hour journey. After a late lunch Dick drove us to a nearby village where we went for a short walk before returning for a cup of tea and then some supper.</p>
        <p>Saturday 29th August</p>
        <p>We had an excellent day out with Kate and Dick. They took us to a NT property just to the NW of Banbury. We had been there before, but the NT were exhibiting it around the fact that the owner during the Second World War (Lord Bearsted) had moved the family merchant bank there, out of London. The weather was fine and so we had a picnic in the grounds, although Angela was stung by a wasp). We started with a talk/tour by a volunteer who told us about the history of the house and it's architecture. On the way back we went past another NT house that we had hoped to visit, but we're too late.</p>
        <p>Sunday 30th August</p>
        <p>We had expected to leave Kate and Dick's after breakfast. However, they persuaded us to go to another NT property in the morning and leave after lunch. However, the house was the other side of Northampton! So it was after three before we got back for lunch and five past five before we left. We arrived home at 5:20. We then spoke to Dad, Bay, Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 31st August</p>
        <p>So we started the day by going over to Dad's to change his bed and do his washing. After lunch I made up another batch of deox-C, the right strength this time, and started soaking the radiator mounting bracket. I also put some rust killer on parts of the back of the radiator grill. The rest of the afternoon was spent doing the accounts and dealing with e-mail while Angela worked in the garden.</p>
