        <p>Sunday 1st November</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to buy a newspaper, Angela went to church and I returned home. I read some of yesterday's paper, had a brief practice on the piano, practiced on the flight simulator and then adjusted the link between the carburetters on the MG. After lunch I took the car for a short run to warm it up and tried adjusting the tuning, but ended up with the settings much the same as were to start with. Then we spoke with Paul et al and Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 2nd November</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went down to Steyning, I went over to Dad's. Whilst there I helped him turn his bed over and cleaned the inside of his fridge. This afternoon I changed his energy tarrif with Scottish Power to hopefully save him over &#163;200 a year. I also installed Skype on the iMac and MacBook in preparation for a video conference call tomorrow. After an early dinner I went over to George's to meet with him, Hamish and Dave Hartley to talk about the work that Dave has been doing with schools.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 3rd November</p>
        <p>I started by looking at the 'wearable technology' workshop documents that Daniel sent, before we had a video conference call with Sarah. Then, after completing the monthly accounts, I generated small and medium versions of photos of Rowan for the Grandchildren web page. I also started looking at the Arduino clones that I had bought before we went to California. I made up a temporary connector between the Pro Mini and the USB interface board and tested one module using the onboard led. Then it was a trip to the Hawth in Crawley for firstly the IET Sussex LN AGM and then a talk from Jeremy Watson. The AGM, which had not been publicised, was the strangest yet! But the talk (from next year's IET President) was good, if somewhat rambling.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 4th November</p>
        <p>I started by dealing with e-mail, including sending Sathish my notes from the AGM yesterday. Later I helped Angela set up her WI accounts spreadsheet for the new year and tested the other Funduino and the two voltage regulators, including remaing the temporary connector between the Funduino and the USB interface board. I created small and medium photos for the Austin collection for the Grandchildren web page. I then spent some time researching savings accounts and trying to set up one with the Post Office. After a couple of failures with Verified by Visa I phoned Barclays, who reset my debit card. However, the PO have e-mailed welcoming me to their online account!</p>
        <p>Thursday 5th November</p>
        <p>A wet day. We drove over to Dad's as usual on a Thursday, but today Angela drove off to Holmebush to do the shopping while Dad and I walked over to the surgery for his annual health review. He is very fit for his age. When we got back, I cleared out his filing box. However, it took Angela quite a long time to do the shopping on her own. After a very late lunch Angela went to Bay's and I finished creating small and medium photos for the Grandchildren web page.</p>
        <p>Friday 6th November</p>
        <p>The day started with me dropping Angela off at the church, complete with her jars of lime marmalade, for her to help set up for tomorrow's bazar. I then went on to deliver some of Bay's coats to the hospice shop. When I got home I copied all my web page files to Google Drive, so that they can be accessed from any device, and created a document (html) that described the organisation of the files and web sites. Angela got back very late for lunch and I did a little more to the 'Grandchildren' page. It seemed to rain pretty much non-stop all day!</p>
        <p>Saturday 7th November</p>
        <p>Most of today was taken up with the Christmas Bazzar at Angela's church. We collected two elderly women, becasue one's car had broken and the other had marmalade to transport. Angela helped in the kitchen and I sold lunch tickets. We had our lunch there before I took the two ladies home while Angela helped clear up. When home, I did the weekly accounts before sitting down to read bits of the paper that I bought in Steyning after parking the car. I also had a quick look around the Steyning Art Group exhibition in the Steyning Centre.</p>
        <p>Sunday 8th November</p>
        <p>Our walk to the Beeding newsagents was disrupted this morning when we found that Maudlin Lane had a puddle right across. So Angela turned around (she was wearing shoes since she was going on to church), but I managed to climb around it. Then I spent the rest of the day creating a 'history' page for the TC, while Angela did a good deed by taking two people to see Peter in hospital. When she got home we spoke to Paul et al and then Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 9th November</p>
        <p>Angela was scheduled to to do the later shift for the lunch club, but someone was ill and she did both the early and the later shift! Meanwhile, I went to Dad's to help him change his bed and do his washing. I also took some frozen fish and chips and had lunch with him. When I got home, just before Angela, I copied my RC files to Google Drive and started trying to design a breadboard for my 'clown' demonstrator, using a Funduino Pro Mini. After tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting. The talk was given by the publisher of the Worthing Journal.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 10th November</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela visited Mel and Val, I ordered some hand brake cables and reworked my breadboard design for my 'clown' demonstrator. We eat dinner at lunchtime and then I ent to the RCEA meeting while Angela went to her WI committee meeting. Then it was home for a quick sandwich before going off to Moulescomb for the awards ceremony. There were about 100 people, recipients of awards and their relatives/friends.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 11th November</p>
        <p>A good day. Luckily it stayed dry and, in fact, the sun came out for a while for the Sussex Wanderers run. I started by driving the MG to Beeding and putting 20 litres of fuel (plus additive) in the tank. Then I drove, via Small Dole and Hurstpierpoint, to the Sportsman pub at Goddards Green, about 12 miles. I was early, but before long other MGs arrived. In total there were about 20 cars. We had coffee and left for Handcross. The route directions were typed and impossible to read as you were driving along. So the three T-Types drove in convoy, with a navigator in the lead car. After a terrific drive of 18 miles, going past Balcombe viaduct, we arrived at the Red Lion in handcross for lunch. We had quite a wait to be served (in spite of having pre-ordered), but the food was good. I drove home, followed by an MGA to the Beeding roundabout, arriving just after three. After dinner I replied to Bernard and had a long conversation with George.</p>
        <p>Thursday 12th November</p>
        <p>We were back to our normal shopping day today. Although as I tried to open the garage door I found that the joints on the end door had come apart! I hammered it back together so that I could open the doors. Then we went to Dad's to compile his shopping list and then took him off to Holmbush. We started with coffee and did the M&amp;S and Tesco shopping. After lunch Angela went around to Bay's while I repaired the garage door. I cleaned out the track and screwed a piece of plywood across the joint that had come apart. At least the door now opens. Following that, I wiped over the MG and removed the mud from under the wings. I also took out one of the spark plugs. It was oily! Later I transferred money (from the AA account) into my new Post Office account.</p>
        <p>Friday 13th November</p>
        <p>After a shower and breakfast I left at 7:30 and drove to Simon's house on this side of Storrington. There was no traffic at Washington, so I was early! When Hamish arrived he offered to drive and so we set off for Birmingham. We stopped for coffee just north of Banbury and arrived at the NEC around midday, parking in the station multi-story and walking across the covered bridge into the exhibition halls. There were five halls and we walked up and down the aisles of them all! By six o'clock we had done and I had picked up my handbrake cables from the Octagon Club stand. It turned out that the daughter of the club chairman, Brian Rainbow, lives in Bramber! We stopped for a KFC meal at Warwick services and I arrived home just before 10:30. A tiring, but good day.</p>
        <p>Saturday 14th November</p>
        <p>By the time we had walked to Beeding newsagents, driven to Bay's to find that she was not up to going out, been to have our flu jab and then returned to Bay's to tidy up, the morning had gone. After lunch Angela cooked the Christmas cake and made mince pies and carrot cake buns while I did the weekly accounts and replied to e-mails. Another day gone, with only culinary items to show for it.</p>
        <p>Sunday 15th November</p>
        <p>This morning I had to walk on to the BP garage to buy a paper, while Angela went on to church. Then I read some of yesterday's paper before continuing with my 'clown' demonstrator. Later in the afternoon I tried using an old power supply as input to the step-down module, but the module started overheating. Even though the 12V DC module was supplying 18V, the module should work with up to 50V. However, all is well if I use a regulated 12V supply or a 12V battery pack. We then spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 16th November</p>
        <p>The morning started by a walk down to the opticians in Steyning. It seems that my eyes are in good condition and have not really changed over the past two years. Then we walked around to Bay's. She had heard yesterday evening that Sally (Sam's nice) and her husband would be visiting her today. They arrived at about 11:30 and left at 1:30. This just gave us time to walk home and for me to drive Angela to the Steyning Centre for her WI meeting. I then went home, ate a sandwich and went to Dad's. Today we only had to turn over his bed clothes. So my day was taken up with things associated with Bay and Dad.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 17th November</p>
        <p>I started the day by walking down to Beeding to have my hair cut. Meanwhile Angela went to Steyning. When I got home, called to say that his boiler had stopped working. He (actually Pat) called BG, who came later and fixed it. We ate our main meal at lunch-time since I went to Falmer for an IET talk on wearable technology. During the afternoon I tested the breadboard for my 'clown' demonstrator. I just have the voltage to the motor to correct.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 18th November</p>
        <p>Actually, the motor drive on my 'clown' demonstrator didn't need fixing. I read the embossed text on the motor to find that it wanted 3-8V, rather than the 12V that I was using. So I put the step-down module in between the battery pack and the motor. I compiled the list of STEM related activities this year and sent them to STEM Sussex. I also wrote to a note to Ron in Connecticut, sending him a photo of cars on our Wanderers run, and then cleaned the plugs on the TC. They were actually not as bad as I had feared. Nevertheless, I started doing some research into oil leaks.</p>
        <p>Thursday 19th November</p>
        <p>Today was Dad's 92nd birthday. So we had arranged to go over to him at about midday and take him out for lunch. Before that we went to Steyning so that Angela could get batteries for Bay's hearing aids. I got some cash and went into Bunces to look at fan heaters (for Bay) and mouse traps (for us). The former were too expensive and the latter (Little Nipper) could not be set! We took Dad to a steak house in North Lancing. The steaks were cold (and so replaced) and then Dad's was too tough for him to eat (so we both swapped parts of our steaks for his). Not a great success. We then went on to Holmebush to do the wekly shop. After leaving Dad, with his shopping, we went around to Bay's (again), with her shopping. Unfortunately, the fan heater that we bought in Tescos did not work!</p>
        <p>Friday 20th November</p>
        <p>Quite a busy day. While Angela went down to Steyning, I took the faulty fan heater back to Tesco at Holmebush, getting it replaced with one that worked. Later I took the MG out of the garage and drove to Patcham for lunch with Simon Windust. Unfortunately Mark could not make it due to a recurrance of his back problem. Simon seems a little lost following the loss of his wife. I went on from there to Shoreham Airport where I met up with George and Bronagh to talk about her visit to the IET Sussex LN committee meeting on Tuesday. It was dark by the time that we left and comming up Annington Road was probably not a good idea. After an early tea Angela went to the church hall to help with a 'rock concert'!</p>
        <p>Saturday 21st November</p>
        <p>The day started with flurries of sleat and snow, but soon turned dry and later was sunny, albeit with a strong, cold wind. We wrapped up to walk to the newsagents, after which I did the weekly accounts. I also e-mailed Paul, asking a question about the 'div' tag in html, including a simple example. Later he replied with a good explanation of what was happening. After lunch, while Angela worked in the garden, I cleaned the mud off the MG. It really needs the wheels removing so as to clean under the wings properly. I then did some more to my 'Grandchildren' web page and then rebuilt the TC's page so as to overcome the layout changing for different window sizes (I think).</p>
        <p>Sunday 22nd November</p>
        <p>I had to walk to the BP garage in Beeding to buy a paper this morning. Meanwhile, Angela walked back from Beeding bridge to go to church. Then I created a new version of my TC web page; one that will not get rearranged when the window size changes. After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed and put on his washing.</p>
        <p>Monday 23rd November</p>
        <p>Just before I was due to go to Storrington, to Rydon school, Bay phoned. In a weak voice she asked if we could go round. So I took Angela to her and then went off to Storrington. Bay recovered and the wearable technology workshop was intresting. When I got home I sent feedback to STEM Sussex.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 24th November</p>
        <p>A busy and interesting day. I added photos of Juniper to my 'grandchildren' web page, but ran into problems adding a link to the iWeb-generated Family page. After an early lunch i went on an RCEA-organised visit to Ricados. Then I went to the Hawth in Crawley for an IET Sussex LN committee meeting. We started with a presentation from Bronagh on STEM Sussex.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 25th November</p>
        <p>I spent most of the day in the garage, trying to remove the first of the handbrake cables on the MG. Two bolts that hold on the greasing point on the cable proved stubborn. So I left them covered in penetrating oil and ordered some new Whitworth spanners. Later in the afternoon we had a call from Bay's help line saying that she was without power. So I went round there while Angela completed dinner. Bay had started turning on her lamps in the sitting room (using her remote) and a bulb had broken, causing the fuse in teh plug to blow and the main breaker to trip. So I replaced the bulb, fitted a new fuse and reset her clocks. While Angela went to a flower club meeting I started writing up the minutes for last night's IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Thursday 26th November</p>
        <p>We set off for our weekly shopping expedition a little earlier this week. This allowed us to call into Dunelm Mill and buy Dad a new vertical blind for his kitchen. Now I just need to cut it to size and fit it! I also called into Screwfix to collect some Whitworth spanners that I had ordered, but I had not ordered them early enough yesterday. We then went on to Holmebush and did our shop, getting home no later than usual. However, this week we also did a little shopping for Philip in Maudlin Parkway. So after lunch Angela bought a few more items in Steyning and then took the shopping to both Philip and Bay. Meanwhile, I completed the minutes for the IET committee meeting and sent them to Sathish. I also continued modifying the Family and Grandchildren pages.</p>
        <p>Friday 27th November</p>
        <p>This morning, after Angela had been to Steyning and I had modified the font size on my Family page, we went to B&amp;Q in Shoreham to buy mouse traps and a Christmas tree. It is early, but we want a small tree and they seem to sell out quickly. I cut an inch off the bottom of the trunk and sttod it in a bucket of water in the greenhouse. I also set the two mouse traps! As well as B&amp;Q, we called into Screwfix and I collected my Whitworth spanners. I'm pleased with the set (in a roll), but the particularly difficult bolts turned out to be 7/16&quot; AF! They were clearly odd bolts that had been lying around when the handbrake cable was installed. Anyway, I got them undone, removed the old cable and fitted the new one. I still need to refit the hub and adjust the cable. Then I have to tackle the other side! While I was 'playing' with these things, Angela went to a WI science meeting at Washington. </p>
        <p>Saturday 28th November</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to buy a paper I read some of the paper, did the weekly accounts and paid for our telephone line rental. After lunch I put the brake drum back and adjusted the handrake cable. Then I finished cleaning the mud off the underside of the near-side. Finally I moved everything around to the off-side and sprayed some penetrating oil on the handbrake cable bolts. But it looks as though they have been painted over!</p>
        <p>Sunday 29th November</p>
        <p>This morning, after buying a Sunday paper, I started trying to remove the off-side handbrake cable on the MG while Angela went to church. However, I got stuck when I found that the fixing of the cable sheath to the chassis has a washer stuck in it, preventing the cable from coming out of the slot in the fixing. After lunch we went to the Steyning Centre to a Music Society concert. It was by Bella Trompe, an all female trumpet quartet. Not my favorite sound, but an entertaining afternoon. When we got home we spoke to Paul and then Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 30th November</p>
        <p>While Angela went off this morning to do a food safety course, I went over to Dad's to replace the verticle blind in his kitchen. It took most of the day. In fact I got home a little before 4:30, just after Angela arrived home. Then Angela went round to Bay's to collect a list of people to whom she wanted to send pots of bulbs for Christmas. I then entered all this information into the Thompson &amp; Morgan web site and ordered her bulbs. This evening I ordered a road play mat (and some road signs) for delivery to Victoria for Austin's Christmas present.</p>
