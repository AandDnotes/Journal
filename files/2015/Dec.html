        <p>Tuesday 1st December</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to Steyning I managed to firstly remove the washer that was stuck in the cable clamp and secondly to remove the whole cable. The greasing point was difficult to remove, with bolts with a 7/16'' AF heads and 3/16 BSW bolts! After lunch we went to the tip and then to Dad's to see if we could get his folding bed in the car. One part of it was just too wide! Then Bay phoned to say that her TV had stopped working. So I called there on my way out and reset her TV to use the digital input. I then went to Crawley to an IET talk on 5G. The food had all gone by the time that I got there!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 2nd December</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to Steyning, I started installing the off-side handbrake cable. After lunch we both walked down to Steyning; Angela to go to her table tennis and me to see the dermatologist at the health centre. The mark on my shoulder is fine. When I got home, the window cleaner had started cleaning the windows. Then I went back to the MG, but got stuck when I tried to pull the cable to the lever connection. It is necessary to compress the spring that is at the hub end of the cable. I could do this on the near side, but on the off side the cable runs through an exhaust pipe bracket, preventing me from pulling the cable against the spring. I tried compressing the spring using a G-cramp, but it wasn't stable enough. After dinner I wrote the template for my Christmas letters.</p>
        <p>Thursday 3rd December</p>
        <p>Our trip to Holmebush started this morning in Next, looking for slippers for Rowan. We had to order her size. Then coffee, M&amp;S shopping, followed by Tesco. Angela was shopping for Philip as well today. We were quite late home, so it was three o'clock before I got into the garage, after Angela had left for Philip's and Bay's. I managed to fit the off-side brake cable using a small G-cramp and a small mole wrench to clamp the cable, but it is pulled too much! So I took photos of all the parts to help analyse the problem.</p>
        <p>Friday 4th December</p>
        <p>This morning was mainly about Barefoot. A number of files arrived before the online training session from midday to about 1:30. It is all being organised centrally, with documents auch as teacher packs being posted. I had decided that the handbrake cable was not going into the hole in the chassis fixing point just behind the lever fixing point, so after lunch I removed the cable and tried to remove the fixing. However, I could not undo the nut, even though I had scraped away the paint. Then I realised that I could remove some of the plastic outer covering so that the spiral sheath would fit into the hole, which it did. I got the cable installed and all seems well. After dinner I went tot he SRFC Christmas party at Worthing Leisure Centre.</p>
        <p>Saturday 5th December</p>
        <p>As usual, we bought a paper at the Beeding newsagents. Then, after reading a little of the paper, I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly and then the monthly accounts. Meanwhile, Anglea did some clearing up and emptied the wardrobe in the back spare bedroom. I then moved it out a little so as to get at the fused spur for the shower room machinator. We turned it off and put some descaler in it. After lunch I went into the garage, removed the near-side handbrake cable, cut back the plastic coating and refitted it. I then applied some preservative to exposed ends of the body frame, cleaned up under the wings and along the chassis, painted the nut of the fixing on the off-side, wiped the oil off the differential, gearbox and engine and put back the rear hubs and wheels. Tomorrow I can adjust the handbrake and then take the car off the axle stands.</p>
        <p>Sunday 6th December</p>
        <p>Another walk to the newsagents was followed by time in the garage. I checked that the hand brake locked each rear wheel and then lowered the car to the ground. Then I checked the tyre pressures and the engine and gearbox oil levels. After lunch we went to Dad's. We changed his bed and put on two lots of washing, the second beign for jumpers. Later we had a long chat with Victoria and then a talk with Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 7th December</p>
        <p>This morning I dropped Angela at a bus stop on the Worthing seafront so that she could catch a bus into Worthing. I then took the wicker washing basket to a charity shop, went to Halfords to pick up (free) LED bicycle lamps and a mirror for Angela's bike, moved on to the tip and then went to Screwfix to buy a set of overalls. When I got home I opened up the back of the MG and topped up the differential with oil. After lunch I took the car of a test run (of seven miles). The handbrake seems fine, although I think that the collets at the the reart of the cables should fit into the plate on the bakplates. So I will need to take off the cables again! Later I went to Falmer to the talk by Ravi from NASA, going on to have dinner with him in Brighton.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 8th December</p>
        <p>This morning I switched our electricity and gas supply from eon (who's annual cost was going up by &#163;250) to First Direct (fixed until 21st Jamuary 2017). This should save us over &#163;400 a year. Later I also started looking at an alternative insurer for the Panda. After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting at Field Place.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 9th December</p>
        <p>A gloriously sunny day, even if it wasn't very warm. I set off just before ten o'clock with the hood down and made my way to Camelia Botnar, via Henfield. Brian was already there, so we bought coffee and gradually the others arrived. We then all set off on our 24 mile run, via some very muddy lanes, to Dial Post where we had lunch in the Crown. And a good lunch it was too. I arrived home at about 3:15, having completed 43 miles. I put the car in the garage, changed and then tried to remove at least some of the mud! When I finished, Angela arrived back from table tennis.</p>
        <p>Thursday 10th December</p>
        <p>Shopping took us a little longer this morning, so we had a very late lunch. While Angela took shopping to Philip and Bay, I organised insurance for the Panda through Heritage. I then cancelled the RAC cover. Later I completed my (fairly short) list of Christmas cards.</p>
        <p>Friday 11th December</p>
        <p>Victoria's birthday (39 today). Angela spent most of the day shopping and cleaning for the lunch club. Meanwhile, I tried to install the outside light by the garage. Fixing it outside and bringing the cable into the garage was the easy bit. I had originally intended wiring the new lamp into the distribution box, but it already has the full complement of wires in that circuit breaker and is very congested. So I decided to break into one of the existing outside light cables, using a fused spur box and a connector with an extra piece of cable. However, the connections in the fused spur box will not tighten enough on the multi-stranded cable that I am using to run to the light. I vacuumed part of the garage, mainly to remove the cobwebs where I wanted to install the new cable.</p>
        <p>Saturday 12th December</p>
        <p>This morning we collected the lunch club's turkey from the butcher and put it in the fridge in the church hall kitchen. I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts and e-mailing Ron in Connecticut. Then after a longish lunch I managed to finish wiring the new outside lamp.</p>
        <p>Sunday 13th December</p>
        <p>This morning, after walking to the newsagents at Beeding and while Angela was at church and cooking the lunch club's turkey, I started making a new wooden block for the top of the trolley jack that will fit under the differential. After lunch we went down to the church hall and sliced the turkey breasts for tomorrow's lunch. When we got home we spoke to Victori and to Paul. Later I put an advert on the Totally T-Type web site for a copy of TC Forever.</p>
        <p>Monday 14th December</p>
        <p>After taking Angela to the church hall with her lunch club things (and her WI bag for later), I showered and set off for a little shopping expedition on my way to Dad's. Halfords do not stock Bilt Hamber wax in store, only online. So I ordered a tin later from Opie Oils, since I found a discount code that saved me all of 60p! I also bought some rather drab plastic garden 'trugs' from B&amp;Q and then bought an F-clamp and vernier callipers from Screwfix. Finally I got to Dad's, turned his bed clothes over, collected his tablets and changed a photo of Juniper in his frame. After a latish lunch I went in the garage and finished making the wooden adapter for the trolley jack. Now I can jack up the rear of the MG and refit the brake cables! Later I discovered that Terry Bone had indeed sold TC4985. However, it was almost unrecognisable (thus why I missed spotting it on his web site). I e-mailed him to see if he has any more details, even though he did not reply last time. Bay had phoned last night about brown water in her bath and toilet. The plumber found a blocked drain (as we suspected) and cleared it.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 15th December</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning cleaning the inside of the windows while Angela went to Steyning and did other housework. After lunch we went to Bay's. I checked a table lamp that had blown the bulb and Angela helped her write Christmas cards. When I got back I fond a reply from Terry Bone. It was he who imported my MG and he gave me the name of the person from whom he bought it. He also gave a suggestion on how to find that person, but the postings on the MG Enthusiasts web site suggested that he was not a very reputable supplier of MG parts. Then I went to an IET talk on lasers and had a dring at the Red Lion with Hamish, Dave and Dave.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 16th December</p>
        <p>Today has been a day of doing small jobs. This morning I brought in the Christmas tree, put on the lights and put lights in the front porch. While Angela was at her table tennis club this afternoon I checked one of the MG's spark plugs, cleaned up the trolley jack and tidied the garage so that the Panda can be put in it and I replied to several e-mails. I also updated the applications and OS on the iPad.</p>
        <p>Thursday 17th December</p>
        <p>We were a little early this morning getting to Dad's and he was still at the corner shop. So we did the shopping in M&amp;S before stopping for coffee and we were not as late home as usual. This afternoon I had a (pre-arranged) call from the head of STEM South East about my experiences with STEM Sussex. Afterwards I dusted and vacuumed the spare bedrooms while Angela went to Philip's and Bay's.</p>
        <p>Friday 18th December</p>
        <p>We started the day by driving to Littlehampton, primarily to visit the Kent Reliance office. There we openned a new regular savings account for each of us and got cheques for this past year's savings. We then did a little shopping before coming home for lunch. Angela then went to Steyning and to Bay's while I dusted and vacuumed the dining room and tried (unsuccessfully) to set up a standing order to pay money into the new regular savings accounts. I also updated my TC history page.</p>
        <p>Saturday 19th December</p>
        <p>Being Saturday we started with a walk to the Beeding newsagents, only to find that they had sold out of Telegraphs. So we walked on to the BP garage. I spent the rest of the morning setting up standing orders for our regular savings accounts and doing the weekly accounts while Angela prepared dishes for this evening. After lunch I did a little more to the Year Notes pages, bringing them up to the state they were previously in and adding to the 2012 page. Then Paul et al arrived just before five.</p>
        <p>Sunday 20th December</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church so Paul and I took the MG to get some petrol at Beeding and then on to Lyons Farm to buy a jigsaw roll from Argos. as we were approaching Lyons Farm so it started raining! Not only did the car get wet, but I had to try out the windscreen wipers. Although the car had dried quite a lot by the time that we got home, I wiped it over and tried to remove at least some of the mud from under the wings. After lunch we prepared vegetables for dinner before Angela went out again. I cooked the meal, but made the mistake of putting oil in the pan, which smoked badly. We all spoke to Victoria et al after dinner.</p>
        <p>Monday 21st December</p>
        <p>We started the day fairly late this morning, but while Angela, Paul, Krista and Rowan went to Steyning, I went to Dad's. I changed his bed, put on his washing, cut his toe nails and started his packing. When I got home, Angela was still at a funeral in Bramber. After lunch Paul et al went round to Bay's, while we did some of the jigsaw (that Krista had continued with this morning). We then fed Rowan while Paul and Krista went out to dinner and to the cinema to see the new Star Wars film. I then sent my article to the editor of Main Gear and uploaded year notes for 2013.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 22nd December</p>
        <p>Another late start to the day. We went down to Steyning to collect the turkey (and other meat). It was raining and blustery so we dressed up in waterproof trousers and went in the car. It stopped raining by the time we got there! After lunch Paul edt al went off in the direction of Guildford to visit freinds in the afternoon and others in the evening. Meanwhile I took Angela to Worthing hospital for an audiology appointent. We then finished the jigsaw (Krista had done quite a lot in the morning) before getting dinner.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 23rd December</p>
        <p>Paul et al went off this morning to visit friends in Hampton and in Horley. Since tomorrow is Christmas Eve, we brought our shopping day forward, but went to Sainsbury's at Hove because Angela thought it would be quieter than Tesco. It was packed! Nevertheless we were back at Dad's by one o'clock. After lunch Angela went to Philip's and Bay's while I downloaded our quaterly energy statement and dealt with e-mail.</p>
        <p>Thursday 24th December</p>
        <p>Angela went off to Steyning this morning, but it started raining! Just before lunch Paul and Krista went to Lyons Farm to do a little shopping, while Rowan decorated some Christmas buscuits. Meanwhile, I cleared away the jigsaw so that we could use the table for lunch. Apart from cooking and eating, we did little this afternoon. However, Paul and Krista went off just after eight to meet up with friends in Storrington, while we put Rowan to bed. Our move to First Utility as an energy supplier is progressing and I had to supply them woth meter readings today.</p>
        <p>Friday 25th December</p>
        <p>Christmas Day! Luckily Rowan did not wake up too early. Before breakfast she opened the few small parcels that were in her stocking. Once breakfast things had been cleared away we started preparing lunch. Luckily Paul went to collect Dad and then, later, Bay. We had a good lunch, opened presents and then spoke with Victoria and Austin. Although they had only just finished breakfast, we watched Austin open some of his presents, including the road mat that we had given him. I just managed to get Bay and Dad home and get back in time to watch most of the final 'Downton Abbey' (we only missed up to the first commercial break).</p>
        <p>Saturday 26th December</p>
        <p>Boxing started with Paul et al leaving just after eight to head to Gatwick. They had a good journey home. We left at a quarter to nine to help Dad do his final packing and drive him to Cobham services. We were early, getting there at a quarter to eleven, and Alan was late, by an hour! So we didn't get home until after two. While Angela prepared lunch (and cleared up) I collected Bay. We were hopeless at the Telegraph quiz after lunch and then watched the TV until I took Bay home.</p>
        <p>Sunday 27th December</p>
        <p>Today was a day of catching up with things. We walked to Beeding to get a paper, then, while Angela was at church, I did the weekly accounts and downloaded photos from the camera. Then I whiled away most of the afternoon before we had a chat with Victoria and Austin. Then it was watching TV and creating the 'kitchen update' page.</p>
        <p>Monday 28th December</p>
        <p>Today was a bank holiday since Boxing Day fell on a Saturday. It was also a fine, mainly sunny day and so we went out for a walk. We drove to Slindon, had coffee in The Forge, went for a four-mile circular walk, mainly through beech woods, had lunch in The Forge and walked around the village before driving home. When we got home Angela put on some washing, I updated the Linux and Windows systems and we read and prepared dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 29th December</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to the butchers, I cleared my work bench in the study and tidied up things, including recording details of the flasher wiring on the MG. After lunch we went into Worthing and ordered a new matress. It will be delivered on Monday! Then I started looking at build logs for Tiger Moth models.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 30th December</p>
        <p>We set off at ten to ten thismorning to pick up Dad. We had heard on the radio that today was going to be the busiest day on the roads this holiday, so we left ten minutes early and arrived at Cobham services ten minutes early! Alan was only a little late. We got home just before two, having taken Dad home, turned on his house and got him to put on his lunch. After our lunch Angela made two lots of soup and a cake, while I sent Victoria her tax statement, arranged for Dad's parcel to be re-delivered and got him a quote for house insurance. we should be able to save him &#163;15 each month. I then looked at someones build log for a Tiger Moth.</p>
        <p>Thursday 31st December</p>
        <p>Although it is New Year's Eve, it was also shopping day. Our lists were not very long, so we were home relatively early. While Angela was delivering the shopping, I arranged Dad's house insurance and cacelled the drect debit with eon. I then spent some more time researching Tiger Moths.</p>
