        <p>Thursday 1st October</p>
        <p>Sam started her holiday at 9am this morning when we took her to the cattery! Then we had a sit down while waiting for the taxi (which arrived at ten), although I only just remembered the BART cards and the Avis card. There was some congestion on the M25 and the driver did not handle it very well. However, we got to Heathrow at 11:30, checked our bags, got through security and had plenty of time for half a sandwich and a coffee before our flight. The flight was scheduled for 14:00, but it was 13:50 before we started boarding and, since the plane was an A380, there were lots of passengers. We took off at about 14:45. We had seats on an emergency exit row and so had plenty of leg room. However, there was no window! They gave us a hot meal, a snack and then another hot meal, which was really too much. I watched two films (45 Years and Kingsman) and Angela watched one. We arrived at about 5 o'clock local time. Passport control was very quick, although we had quite a wait for our cases and then another long wait for the right shuttle bus to the hotel. We got to the hotel just before seven and sent a message to Brandon.</p>
        <p>Friday 2nd October</p>
        <p>After. a poor night's sleep we were up at six, showered, had breakfast and caught the 8:15 shuttle bus to the airport to catch the BART into San Francisco. We changed trains at Powell and then caught the Amtrack train at Richmond, arriving in Davis just after twelve. Brandon was there to meet us. We then spent the rest of the afternoon talking with V &amp; B, before B collected Austin from pre-school. After dinner we went for a walk to the park.</p>
        <p>Saturday 3rd October</p>
        <p>We all had a bit of a lie in this morning. It was ten o'clock before we had finished breakfast and showered and we're ready to do something. We started by taking Austin for a walk, except that he rode in his buggy. We tried to find a playground, but got a bit lost. We had a snack by a playground and then walked back. After lunch we spent a lot of the afternoon either playing with Austin or doing a jigsaw puzzle. After dinner we took Austin back to the playground (that we had passed in the morning), but this time he took his bike.</p>
        <p>Sunday 4th October</p>
        <p>A quiet day. We spoke to Paul mid morning, but otherwise just held Juniper, played with Austin and finished the jigsaw puzzle. After dinner we went for a walk to a playground with Austin. We then gave him a bath, but he would not get dressed for bed!</p>
        <p>Monday 5th October</p>
        <p>We had another lazy day. We had intended walking Austin to school, but ran out of time. So Victoria drove and I went with them. We then sat around for the rest of the day, holding Juniper and talking, until it was time to collect Austin. Then we all walked to his pre-school to collect him (including Juniper), with his balance bike. He rode the bike all the way home. After dinner, Brandon and I went to s meeting of the local 'maker space'. It was quite interesting, finding out what they do.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 6th October</p>
        <p>We have walked to Austin's pre-school twice today (and back). This morning he rode his bike the and we saw a RouteMaster bus on the way back. This evening we forgot to take the lock key and so had to leave his bike and so he walked all the way home. This afternoon I spent a lot of the time looking at the Tiger Moth plans and making notes about motor, ESC and servo placement.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 7th October</p>
        <p>Today Juniper was two weeks old! So I took some photos. This was after we had both showered and walked Austin to pre-school. We had left his bike there yesterday, so Brandon pushed him in his three-wheeled buggy. Brandon and I went to firstly the Target supermarket and then to Nugget, to get some nappies and some food. After lunch Angela and I lined some kitchen cupboard shelves before we all walked to pick up Austin. He was able to ride his bike home, since we had the lock key with us this time.</p>
        <p>Thursday 8th October</p>
        <p>We had a very tiring day today. It started with a walk to Austin's pre-school. Aston rode his bike, but while Victoria and Brandon cam home, we walked on into Davis. We found that most shops didn't open until ten, so we went into the Whole Foods supermarket to have coffee and look at the map and bus timetable that we had picked up at the tourist information centre. We then bought two postcards, one for Rowan and one for Bay. Angela wrote them and we found the post office. But it did not open until midday! However, it did say that the main post office was open. So we walked a long way along 5th Street to the post office and bought stamps (round ones). It was nearly middY by this time and getting quite hot, so we caught the Perimeter bus around to F Street and then walked through the park. We got back just before one. after a late lunch we sat outside reading. I also finished writing a short item for the WSMGOC Main Gear booklet before it was time to collect Austin. After that walk we were very tired. After dinner I e-mailed the item to Roger Drake. We then had a fight to get Austin bathed and in bed!</p>
        <p>Friday 9th October</p>
        <p>A less energetic day today. We did walk to Austin's pre-school this morning, but then we sat around until lunch-time, when we drove to a BBQ restaurant in Woodland. From there we went to Target and to Costco, both on the outskirts of Woodland. When we got home there was more sitting around until it was time to collect Austin. However, it was still very hot, so Brandon went to collect him. After tea we tried out a couple of WII games with Austin.</p>
        <p>Saturday 10th October</p>
        <p>Another lazy, but exhausting day. We didn't get up until 8:15 and it was nearly 10 o'clock before we had finished breakfast. Brandon had started a new jigsaw puzzle and I spent a lot of the day helping to do it. I did spend a short amount of time helping Brandon sort out a new remote controlled light switch for their ensuite bathroom. We also spent quite some time persuading Austin to eat his dinner. But then I gave him a bath. That really tired me out.</p>
        <p>Sunday 11th October</p>
        <p>We were up late for pancakes again. Then we finished the jigsaw puzzle before taking Austin to the nearest playground (that has the climbing frame and slides in the shade), getting back in time to make lunch. Meanwhile, Brandon was watching the Kansas City Chiefs lose! This afternoon we simply played with Austin. Again he was reluctant to eat his dinner, but the chance to go round to a neighbourhood party prompted him to eat enough. They then spent an hour chatting with neighbours while we had coffee and cleared up.</p>
        <p>Monday 12th October</p>
        <p>This morning we took Austin to school and then walked into Davis. In spite of getting up at 6:30, it was still 9 o'clock before we got to his school. Victoria brought Juniper home while we walked on. Most shops don't open until ten, so we had a cup of coffee before going to the charity book shop. There we bought four paperbacks before looking around some of the other shops. I decided to walk to a bus route that would take us back to Cataline Drive, but it was further than I thought and we missed the bus! So we walked all the way back! After lunch I set up the MacBook Air (while Angela swept up some leaves). Victoria collected Austin in the car, since it was quite warm today, and barbecued some chicken, that we had on a bowl of salad.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 13th October</p>
        <p>We were earlier this morning and got Austin to school just after 8:30, although he wanted to be pushed in his new wheels. When we got back we moved the piles of leaves into the road, ready for collection tomorrow.. I also cleared out the front gutters. We had intended going to the supermarket after lunch, but Juniper kept sleeping and by the time that she woke it was too late. So I did some more experimentation with mu Trips web page on the Mac Air. Victoria collected Austin from school in the car, since it was still hot. He was not in a very good mood. After dinner he improved and while Victoria gave Juniper her first bath (in the sink) I gave Austin a bath. We then took some photos of the two of them on the sofa.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 14th October</p>
        <p>We were quite early this morning, in spite of showering and Austin's late bed-time. However, as we left, Juniper started crying. So Victoria came back and we took Austin to pre-school. He was surprisingly easy to leave there. We then went to Target, where I bought a hat and we stopped for coffee, and then to Nugget to get some food, getting home just in time for lunch. This afternoon Angela hung out washing and did some cooking, while I sat down! After dinner Austin went round to their next-door neighbours to play for a while.</p>
        <p>Thursday 15th October</p>
        <p>Today was a successful day until this evening, when Austin wanted to stop at the ABC playground on the way home from school and then would not ride his bike the rest of the way and later would not eat his dinner. We had dropped him off this morning with his BeeBike, so as to take part in the Trikeathon, and then walked on into Davis. We bought our train tickets for Saturday and a loaf of bread, had coffee in a 'connoisseur's' coffee shop, took books to the charity shop, bought some things in Ace and eventually used our P.O. card in an ATM to get most of the cash out, before we walked back. After lunch Angela did some cleaning and I vacuumed throughout. She then prepared a casserole before we went to collect Austin; then the trouble started.</p>
        <p>Friday 16th October</p>
        <p>Today was our last day in Davis. We walked Austin to school, had a Skype call with Alan and Dad and then went into Davis for a long lunch with Victoria and Brandon. Finally we collected Austin from school before having a light tea. Now just need to pack!</p>
        <p>Saturday 17th / Sunday 18th October</p>
        <p>These two days merged into one as we caught the train from Davis at 09:30 (Pacific Time) on Saturday and arrived home by taxi at 15:20 (BST) on Sunday.Brandon and Austin took us to the station and waved goodbye. The Amtrack Capital Corridor took us to Richmond, where we caught the BART, firstly to Powell and then to SFO. It all worked too smoothly (including airport security) and so we had over two hours to wait before our American Airlines flight to Pheonix. Then we had just over an hour to wait for our BA flight left for the overnight trip to Heathrow. And the taxi was waiting. When we got home and had 'turned on' the house we called Dad and Bay and messaged Victoria before FaceTiming Paul. Then an early night.</p>
        <p>Monday 19th October</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to Steyning to buy some food, I drove the MG, firstly to the Beeding garage to get another ten litres of fuel and then on to Dad's. After lunch I did the weekly and monthly accounts while Angela went to her WI meeting. There were also quite a lot of dividend notices to download. I created a new Altervista site (djwebpages) and ftp'd my Cambridge page and my new Trips page to the TalkTalk site. I also updated the OS on the iMac to El Capitan, which took quite a long time. Then I created a notice for the lecture theatre redirection at tomorrow night's IET talk and printed the notes supplied by Tim Bruton.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 20th October</p>
        <p>Jetlag really hit today! I spent some time sorting out the photos from our visit to California, creating an album of reasonable snaps of the grandchildren. I picked some raspberries and ordered two LED bulbs for the kitchen, finding a discount code that saved 20% and gave free delivery. Late afternoon I drove to Falmer for the IET talk on photovoltaics. In spite of the football match, Tim Bruton and I were there very early. The rearranged venue (Chichester Lecture Theatre) was very good, however, the food did not arrive! But 62 attendees did.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 21st October</p>
        <p>During the day I e-mailed several people in connection with the IET talk last night. I told Chris aout the lack of food; I thanked Tim; I sent Tim's slides to Laurence; and I scanned the attendance register and sent it to Julie. In between I took Dad to his dermatology appointment.</p>
        <p>Thursday 22nd October</p>
        <p>Today was shopping day, which describes most of the day. As usual we started with coffee in M&amp;S, followed by food shopping. After quite a late lunch, Angela went to Bay's and I got distracted by the continued disk activity on the iMac and its poor performance. It has been suggested that, if something is modifying data regularly, then Spotlight is constantly trying to re-index. But even turning Spolight off did not stop the disk noise. So I installed an application called Onyx, but have not yet tried using any of the tools it provides. Angela came back from Bay's with a car load of stuff for the charity shop!</p>
        <p>Friday 23rd October</p>
        <p>We were very late up this morning and so there was no time to do anything before my appointment at the hygienist. Meanwhile, Angela went to Steyning. Afterwards we took some of Bay's stuff to the charity shop. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I cut the grass in the front and the back. I also tried to install iWorks 08 on the Air by simply copying the files from the CD. The apps installed, but would not operate properly.</p>
        <p>Saturday 24th October</p>
        <p>Another late rise. After breakfast we walked to the newsagents in Beeding and then I walked on to Steyning. The health centre was closed, so I put my repeate pescription and pharmacy nomination form in the post box. I had intended finding out how to apply for repeats online and check our flu jab times. I also called in the optitian's and changed my appointment so that I can go to the Classic Car show with Hamish and Simon. After lunch I managed to copy the iWork 08 apps (and supporting files) from the iMac to the Air. They seem to work. Meanwhile, Angela worked in teh garden. Later, when Angela was preparing a casserole for dinner, Bay phoned. A wheel had come off her trolley and she couldn't get it back on. We needed to go there for other reasons, so the cassarole went in the oven and we went round. I fixed the trolley, fixed the leaking water hose on her washing machine (hopefully) and explained to her why she seemed to have a smaller dividend than she had expected.</p>
        <p>Sunday 25th October</p>
        <p>Yet another late rise. However, we seem to have finally recovered from our trip to California. We walked to Beeding to buy the last paper, before Angela went to church and I read parts of yesterday's paper and started looking at reproducing the 'events' page from our web site. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I checked over the cars, including cleaning the windscreen of the TC. We spoke to firstly to Rowan and then to Austin (and their parents).</p>
        <p>Monday 26th October</p>
        <p>A little earlier rise this morning. I was asleep, but Angela woke me at 7:45 to say that breakfast was ready. However, after showering there was little time before Angela needed to go for her appointment at Southlands. I took her, dropped her at the hospital and then went on to Speedy Spares in Portslade to buy some engine oil for the MG. As I was driving back so I saw Angela at the bus top near the Holmbush round-about. She had finished quickly and walked up the road. I then spent what was left of the morning topping up the oil (it took two pints) and fitting the side screens. After lunch (and after sending Victoria a copy of her tax calculation) we took the MG to Dad's, where Angela helped him change his bed and put on two loads of washing, while I cut his grass, hopefully for the last time this year. When home, I experimented a little more with the replacement for the 'events' web page.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 27th October</p>
        <p>It was a relatively early start this morning. Angela was being collected just after eight and the Panda was collected for its service at 8:30. PDH couldn't hear the rattle, so that was not fixed. So they returned the car at about 3:30, just a short while before Angela returned. She was at a 'Women's day of prayer' event, where she seemed to be selling things. Meanwhile I uploaded the new Events web page, fixed the pergola, got remote printing working from the Macbook and sent off the extended warranty form to LED Hut. I also spent quite some time trying to create another web page for the trip to Brighton with Dick and Kate.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 28th October</p>
        <p>I started by completing the 'Brighton' web page and then spent most of the rest of the day getting my Scratch to Arduino interface installed on the MacBook. By dinner time I had the 'control' Scratch program and the 'clown' program installed and working. Meanwhile, Angela went to table tennis this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Thursday 29th October</p>
        <p>Shopping day. But today Dad did not join us, he had the first of his (three) appointments for his annual review at the doctor's. So after we compiled his (short) shopping list, he went to the surgery and we went to Holmebush to do the shopping, starting as usual with coffee. He seemed to have used five sachets of cream for his head, whereas he should have only used three (Friday, Monday and Wednesday). I think he might be applying cream in the mornings as well as the evening. After a late lunch Angela went to Bay's and I dealt with e-mail and did a little research into Chesterfields. I also experimented with modifying the 'family' web page to include Juniper's birth.</p>
        <p>Friday 30th October</p>
        <p>I had nothing planned for today. So I was intending selecting photos of Rowan and Austin and starting to build a 'Grandchildren' web page. Angela went to a course on hearing difficulty this morning, but had a call from Bay before she left. Bay's trolley had broken again and she wanted a new one. So after a morning dealing with e-mail and exporting some photos we took Bay into Worthing to look at trolleys. We found what she was looking for, basically one that was very similar to her old one, but with better handles and brakes. We then stopped for tea and cakes before calling into a jewelers to get a ring adjuster for her and then took her home. It then only took a little while to assemble the trolley. After dinner I did a little more exporting of photos. I think that I have them all exported, but need to create small and medium versions for use on the web page. </p>
        <p>Saturday 31st October</p>
        <p>By the time that we had walked to the Beeding newsagents, then walked along the river to Bay's (to deliver some mayonaise that she desparately needed) and then walked home, there was little time before lunch to do more than the weekly accounts. However, Angela did some work in the garden and after lunch made some lime marmalade as well as doing more gardening. Meanwhile I removed the spark plugs from the MG to discover them very sooted and oily! I also checked the contact points, which were fine. I lubricated parts of the distributor and cleaned the plugs. Having read about carburetter tuning, tomorrow I will try to make the engine run more leanly. I also did a little more on my 'Grandchildren' web page.</p>
