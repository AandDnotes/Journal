        <p>Sunday 1st February</p>
        <p>After walking to the newsagents only to find that they had sold out of Sunday Telegraphs, I walked on to the BP garage to buy one. Meanwhile, Angela had taken the long route to church (via the Bramber roundabout). Apart from reading some of yesterday's paper, I struggled trying to read serial data reliably from the Arduino. Late in the day I realised that, since I had the Serial Monitor open as well as my Python program, data was being shared between the two! We also spoke with Victoria (and Austin) and Paul (and Rowan).</p>
        <p>Monday 2nd February</p>
        <p>It was quite late before I got going this morning after having a shower. However, I then spent the best part of the day trying to get my Python program to plot only one value. Adapting the example plots two values and I could make it plot three, but not one! In the evening I went to the IET programme sub-committee meeting at Bernard's house. I have two talks to arrange!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 3rd February</p>
        <p>I spent the morning searching for PV researchers and e-mailing people at Southampton and Imperial. Someone at imperial replied to ask when we wanted the talk to take place, to which I replied later in the day. I also e-mailed the person at Brighton who seems to be responsible for electron microscopy. After lunch I took Dad to Worthing hospital to have his dressing changed. Then I drove to Crawley for an IET talk on low-dimensional carbon. Afterwards I asked the speaker about one of his slides that implied they used a technique to make graphing that I used when at Lancaster. He said it was exactly that! He also asked if I had a copy of the report.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 4th February</p>
        <p>Today I took my model.from the curtain rail and hung it on the wall. I put two medium-sized screw-eyes in the study wall and made hooks from an old aluminium coat hanger. As on the curtain rail hooks, the new hooks hold the model by the landing gear, just behind the wheels. With Angela's help I moved money out of the Barclays account, into which they had put her regular savings, to the Post Office Easysaver account. It doesn't pay much interest, but it is the only instant access account that we have and it pays better than Barclays. I also experimented a little with my Python module for plotting temperature read from an Arduino.</p>
        <p>Thursday 5th February</p>
        <p>We were later than usual setting off to do the weekly shop since Angela needed to get batteries for Bay's hearing aids and meet her WI committee members to sort out their bank account. So we started with coffee! After lunch we took Bay's shopping to her and looked at one or two things for her. Then we went back to Dad's to take him to collect his new glasses. However, I managed to make a little progress with my temperature plot.</p>
        <p>Friday 6th February</p>
        <p>This morning we took the lunch club vegetables to the church and Angela then went on into Steyning and on to Bay's. Meanwhile I striped down Bay's bedside lamp and found some suitable cable. After lunch we went back to Bay's to pick up a fence panel that had blown down and I nailed it to the posts. Then I managed to save an image of my temperature plot and started looking at how I make a remote connection to the Raspberry Pi. After dinner I went to the flying club's quiz night. You needed to be an aircraft enthusiast to know any of the answers!</p>
        <p>Saturday 7th February</p>
        <p>Our usual walk to the newsagents was a little extended this morning since we went from Beeding to Steyning to look at Paul Cutt's exhibition of paintings in the Penfold Hall. They were quite good, but far too expensive! Apart from reading the paper, I spent most of the rest of the day trying to use my laptop as a Remote Desktop to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
        <p>Sunday 8th February</p>
        <p>The usual walk to the newsagents and reading more of yesterday's paper took quite a lot of the morning. Then I spent most of the rest of the day sorting out my Raspberry Pi. I managed to get the direct connection (from the laptop) and a connection via the router to work. This means that the Pi has access to the Internet. So I started installing the Arduino IDE and copied the Python program across. We then spoke to firstly Victoria (and Austin) and then Paul et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 9th February</p>
        <p>After driving Angela down to the church with 'bits' for the lunch club I tried to set up more on the Pi, only to find that it would not connect to the router! At about eleven I went over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and have lunch with him. When I got back, I continued to try to find out why the Pi would not connect to the router, but with no success.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 10th February</p>
        <p>What had worked yesterday in terms of connections to the Pi did not work today! I tried setting up a route in the router, but it would not accept my values. So I resorted to asking a question on the TalkTalk forum. A reply gave me some useful information about things to research, but answered the wrong question! After lunch I went to the retired engineer's meeting at Field Place. The talk was about the Princess Flying Boat, built in East Cowes and was quite interesting.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 11th February</p>
        <p>I spent most of the day trying to sort out my Pi. I discovered that setting a fixed IP address for the eth0 ports on the laptop and Pi and reserving those addresses in the router allowed the router to see the devices, but not let the device connect through it. So I left the laptop using DHCP (but with a reserved IP address) and two startup files for the Pi, one to use DHCP and one to use a fixed address. However, to use a direct connection I will also need to fix the address in the laptop. I also installed Synaptic and updated the modules on the Pi. In parallel I downloaded the latest version of Raspbian (within the NOOB application) and found advice on installing it without a monitor attached to the Pi.</p>
        <p>Thursday 12th February</p>
        <p>Thursday's seem to come round with alarming regularity! So we had a relatively early start to get Dad's shopping list. Nevertheless we started with coffee in M&amp;S! After lunch I spent quite a long time reading and writing e-mail before picking up from where I left off with the Raspberry Pi. I managed to make an ssh connection to the Pi to switch the startup IP address. I also removed the VNC client (Vinagre) and installed an alternative, which seems able to handle screen resolutions better. I then installed on the Pi the extra 'bits' needed for Python.</p>
        <p>Friday 13th February</p>
        <p>This morning we took Dad to Worthing hospital to get his dressing changed, calling into Wickes on the way home to buy a slate tile to cover the drain gulley outside the kitchen. Most of the afternoon was spent finding an alternative to Motley Fool. They are changing their administrators and want to start charging &#163;20 per quarter. I set up an Investment Account for Angela with Equiniti, but she needs to send them some proof of identity. Then she can send them a form to request a transfer from Motley Fool. This needs to be done within a month from now. I also discovered that Raspbian does not have matplotlab for Python 3.</p>
        <p>Saturday 14th February</p>
        <p>We were a little late getting up, but the newsagents at Beeding still had some papers. By the time we had eat some of the paper, most of the morning had gone. After lunch Angela went off to a garden centre and to buy a new cat scratching post. This morning Sam got a claw caught in the old one and we had to cut her out! When Angela got home we found that the new post was missing its bolt. So rather than take it back to Argos at Lyons Farm, I walked down to Bunces and bought a bolt. Meanwhile I did the weekly accounts. Otherwise, I decided to try building my plotting application on the Pi using Python2 (rather than 3). There were only a couple of changes needed, but I discovered that the plotting put to much load on the Pi. I had to reduce the temperature reading frequency to five seconds in order to get the load below 100% (most of the time). To celebrate my success I posted some details and a photo, plus an image of a plot.</p>
        <p>Sunday 15th February</p>
        <p>It was a fine, sunny day (most of the time), so we had a good walk to the paper shop. I then spent most of the morning reading yesterday's paper! After lunch I messed around with my plotting software, adjusting it to plot points over 24 hours and trying to get the x-axis labels to be displayed vertically. As usual, we spent from four o'clock until after six talking to Paul et al and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 16th February</p>
        <p>Another day of relative inactivity! I finally managed to figure out how to get the x-axis tick labels to display vertically and so set my temperature recorder off on a 24-hour plot. I also read some articles on MG TC owning.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 17th February</p>
        <p>I spent a little time reviewing a few more Springbaord grant applications. At midday I stopped the temperature plot for the study and copied the image to the laptop. After lunch we took Dad to Worthing hospital to have his dressing changed. His wound is doing well, so next week might be the last. We just got home in time for me to leave for Brighton and the Barefoot Computing training session.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 18th February</p>
        <p>I tried e-mailing people at Imperial College and Brighton again in connection with talks for the IET on PV cell development and electron microscopy. I also set up my temperature measurement in the hall, fixing the sensor to the thermostat. Most of the afternoon was spent trying to organise a meeting with Nigel Clout at Edward Street. I also accepted an invitation to join George and Hamish at two sessions in East Grinstead and volunteered to run a Barefoot workshop, again in East Grinstead. Between this, I reviewed a few more Springboard Grant applications.</p>
        <p>Thursday 19th February</p>
        <p>Since we already had people's shopping lists we were able to get to the supermarket relatively early, which meant that we were home just after 12:30. When we got home I stopped and saved the temperature plot in the hall. After lunch, while Angela took Bay's shopping to her I dealt with e-mail, both in and out. Later I started looking at the code for my RC design. I got a little worried when I thought for a while that I had lost my cyrf library.</p>
        <p>Friday 20th February</p>
        <p>This morning I checked that the failed light in the kitchen was the bulb and not the fitting. Then I e-mailed the electrician to find out from where he got the LED bulbs. They, LEDHut, want the electrician to contact them. I also tested that the grill trips the circuit breaker when turned off and arranged for a service engineer to call to replace the element. This afternoon I booked Sam into the cattery at the end of June. Otherwise I read some articles about aspects of TC's and continued looking at the code for my RC design. Then I 'tinkered' with Scratch.</p>
        <p>Saturday 21st February</p>
        <p>After walking to the newsagents in Beeding I finished my 'tinkering' with Scratch and then did the weekly accounts while Angela worked in the garden. After lunch I cut branches off trees and bushes and put a peg in the ground to help hold hold the raised bed together. I also cleaned and sharpened Angela's secateurs and tried to take my pair apart, but could not undo one of the screws. So they are in pieces, but I will not be able to get them together again! Then I spent some time trying to set up another SD card for the Pi, without having a display attached. But so far I can connect to the Pi, but not get an an X-terminal or a VNC connection.</p>
        <p>Sunday 22nd February</p>
        <p>I went on my own to the newsagents this morning since Angela was getting ready to go to church where she was staying for lunch and was taking a trifle. When I got home I went to Dad's to help him change his bed and do his washing. After lunch I read some of yesterday's paper, had a short piano practice, had a 'tinker' with Scratch Junior on the iPad and tried my newly installed Pi SD card on the TV. It seemed to work perfectly, but I still could not the laptop to open a VNC connection when it was plugged back into the network. We also had a chat with Victoria and Austin.</p>
        <p>Monday 23rd February</p>
        <p>It was fairly late this morning by the time I had showered. Then, while Angela went to the village, I reviewed a few more Springboard grant applications. After an early lunch I went over to George's at Ferring, where he and Hamish led me through the 'control' programme for Wednesday and Friday in East Grinstead. It will be an early start on those two days. When I got home I started doing some research on physical interfaces to Scratch.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 24th February</p>
        <p>This morning we took Dad to see Mr Pratt at Worthing hospital. All seems well and his dressing is now off. He has to return in six months. After stopping for a coffee in the hospital reception (because Angela had not returned) we took Dad home. After a late lunch I reviewed a few more Springboard Grant applications. Then I found a way to get individual applications on the Pi to open a window on the laptop and finally to get the Pi desktop to open as an X session on the laptop. However, it is not quite independent of the Mint desktop! I also arranged to meet up (briefly) with Howard Rush when I go into Edward Street next week.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 25th February</p>
        <p>The alarm clock woke me with a start this morning at six o'clock and Hamish arrived to pick me up just after 7:30. We were just a little late getting to East Grinstead.. The morning went very well and after a light lunch we set off back home. I reviewed a few more Springboard Grant applications and looked a little more at Scratch interfaces.</p>
        <p>Thursday 26th February</p>
        <p>Whilst waiting for the cooker service man to come, I did some more research on physical Scratch interfaces and fitted foil behind another radiator (using double-sided tape). The service man initially could not reproduce the fault, but then found a broken wire that was occasionally shorting. He had finished by about 12:30, so we had lunch and then set off to Dad's to get his shopping list before going to M&amp;S and Tesco. When we got back, I reviewed a couple of Springboard Grant applications before helping to prepare dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 27th February</p>
        <p>A second early start this week as Hamish, George and I went to Barleytyne School in East Grinstead again to run another 'control' workshop. I got home at about 2:30. What was left of the afternoon was spent reviewing the remaining Springboard Grant applications.</p>
        <p>Saturday 28th February</p>
        <p>Not a day for actually getting anything done. After updating the weekly accounts, I went to collect Dad. Shortly after our return we went down to the church hall for lunch, organised by St Barnabas Hospice. Afterwards we read the paper (although I did spend a little while looking at the Barefoot slides), took Dad home and went on to M&amp;S so that Angela could buy some new trousers. By the time we got home it was nearly time for tea. So I updated my morning accounts and boiled some eggs.</p>
