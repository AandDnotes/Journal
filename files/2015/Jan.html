        <p>Thursday 1st January</p>
        <p>New Year's Day. I collected Dad and Bay for lunch and tea. However, the day did not start well when Dad walked dog mess into the hall! I managed to get Bay home just after nine, getting home from Dad's at about 9:30.</p>
        <p>Friday 2nd January</p>
        <p>This morning Dad phoned with news of a phone call from the eye clinic at Chichester hospital. He was slightly confused, so I phoned them to find that it was an appointment with the MFU. We then walked around to Bay's to remove her bed in preparation for the arrival of her new one. But the new bed arrived early, before we had removed the base. However, it all went well and we made up her bed and had coffee with her before walking home. We decided to get the bus to Shoreham, have lunch and walk back along the Downs Link. However, the bus did not arrive! Apparently it had broken down. So we walked into Steyning, had lunch in Truffles and the walked around Steyning Bowl. Also, my Christmas present arrived; an Arduino Uno and a stylus for use with the iPad.</p>
        <p>Saturday 3rd January</p>
        <p>We walked in the rain to the newsagents at Beeding before walking on to Hyde Square to get some cream for a trifle that Angela was making to use up the remaining rice pudding. Otherwise, I did the monthly accounts and read the paper. Dad is getting very confused about the two hospital appointments that he has next week. He keeps forgetting that he has to go to Chichester on Wednesday to the MFU. Then. Thinks that it is another eye clinic!</p>
        <p>Sunday 4th January</p>
        <p>I went to Dad's this morning, just to swap his bed around and have coffee with him. After lunch I moved the striking plate on the front porch door so that it catches when closed. Then I started looking at my new Aduino. But I have updated the OS on the laptop since I last connected an Arduino and I could not get the USB connection working.</p>
        <p>Monday 5th January</p>
        <p>Most people have gone back to work today, but not us. I finished making the wing struts for my model and worked out how to make the Arduino IDE on the laptop talk to the Uno. However, I need to start the IDE as root! But I uploaded a sketch to the Uno (the blink sketch) and it worked. We also took down the Christmas decorations and packed them away. We now just have the tree to take out. I also experimented with a blog to use in place of the Maxjournal application on the iPad.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 6th January</p>
        <p>I actually managed to get some work done on my model today. However, I found that the wing struts were too long, even though they were built to plan! So I cut down both ends so as to retain enough of the strengthened ends. After lunch we took Dad to the eye clinic in Worthing. We had quite a long wait to find out that all is well and he can have the cataract removed from his other eye when the optician thinks it needs doing. Meanwhile, Angela went into Worthing. Then we just got home in time for me to drive to Crawley to an IET talk on the Wey and Arun Canal Trust.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 7th January</p>
        <p>Another visit to a hospital! This time St Richard's, where Dad had more skin removed from behind his ear and the side of his nose. All went very well. I had to get him their by 10:30 (we got there at ten) and they phoned me at two to say that he was ready to go home. He was very impressed with the treatment and the helpfulness of the staff. I got him home by four and was home by five. Then I finished putting the shortened wing struts on my model.</p>
        <p>Thursday 8th January</p>
        <p>Angela started by walking in the rain to the health centre to get new batteries for her hearing aids. We then drove (in the rain) to M&amp;S and Tesco to do the weekly shop. After a late lunch I worked on my model and Angela took Bay's shopping to her.</p>
        <p>Friday 9th January</p>
        <p>Today's highlight was having my haircut at Beeding. I only had a little taken off. Otherwise, I worked on my model. I completed the battery adapter, fitted the battery and balanced the plane. So I then screwed the servo plate in place and started looking at connecting the servos to the elevator and rudder.</p>
        <p>Saturday 10th January</p>
        <p>Our new freezer is due to arrive tomorrow. So today, after a walk to the newsagents, we moved the old freezer into the garage and cleaned out the cupboard. The rest of the day seemed to be spent reading the paper.</p>
        <p>Sunday 11th January</p>
        <p>Even though we went to bed late, we needed to get up at 6 o'clock so as to turn off the old freezer to start defrosting it. We put the remains food in the garage fridge. We needed to do this since Curry's had posted that they would deliver the new freezer between 8:10 and 12:10! As it happened, they arrived at 11:10, so the freezer was defrosted and dry. We had to leave the new freezer standing for four hours before turning it on. So I fitted the door handle and Angela wiped it out when she returned from church. At three, we turned the freezer on and went around to Bay's to have a cup of tea with her and collect our food from her freezer. When we got back (at about 4:30) the freezer was well down in the required temperature range and so we put the food in it. Then we spoke to Paul et al and a little later to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 12th January</p>
        <p>This morning we went over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and take him to buy a pair of shoes. Whilst at Lyons Farm I bought a cheap USB stick for Dad's photo frame and we had a cup of coffee in Sainsbury's.. Later I created modified forms of the photos sent by Alan of Eva, Teddy, Theo and Ollie, added them to those of Rowan and Austin, and loaded them on to the new memory stick. I will swap the sticks when we visit him on Thursday. I spent quite a lot of the day looking for a suitable supplier of a free website. I eventually chose Altervista, an Italian operation, and set up a site.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 13th January</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela was at a church meeting, I caught up with a number of e-mail and moved money in preparation for buying Pensioner Bonds (when they are announced). Since I was going to a meeting in the evening and there would be sandwiches, I cooked lunch. Afterwards I went to the RCEASUSSEX meeting at Field Place in Worthing. There was a talk on offshore wind power by someone from Siemens. It was a good talk and I got his card. I only just got back in time to get to the IET committee meeting in Crawley. I gave Neil a lift to the station and got some petrol, arriving home at about 9:15.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 14th January</p>
        <p>A quieter day today. I managed to 'finish' my model. At least, it should just about be ready to fly. I now just need some fine weather (warm, dry and calm). Otherwise, I organised meeting Simon and Mark (for lunch), sent Paul his car insurance no-claims record and got Laurence to add a note about the B&amp;W talk to the Sussex IET blog.</p>
        <p>Thursday 15th January</p>
        <p>Shopping day. After lunch I restored Windows 8. Although I now need to sort out the boot options. I also applied for a one-year pensioner bond! Their site would not work on Safari, and the whole process was slow on Firefox. I had hoped to also apply for a three-year bond, but they want to send a form to sign before they accept my application.</p>
        <p>Friday 16th January</p>
        <p>The morning was spent at Worthing hospital, where Dad had his stitches removed. They were running about an hour late! After lunch I added to my RC blob and then tested the control surface throws on my model. Whereas the elevator and rudder are good, the ailerons do not move enough and there is insufficient differential throw. I spent some time trying to work out the required position of the holes in the servo horn, but really I just need to follow the plan. I need to try to make a larger servo horn.</p>
        <p>Saturday 17th January</p>
        <p>After a slightly extended walk to the newsagents (we went along the resurfaced river path and the new extension to the Downs Link) and reading the resulting paper, I made a larger aileron servo horn from an off cut of ply. Now I need to buy some new threaded rods so as to link the servo to the aileron horns. I spent a lot of time trying to understand why the laptop will not boot into rEFInd directly and I signed up for 12 issues of SelfBuild &amp; Design magazine (using part of Auntie Bay's Christmas present). The first issue (April's) will be dispatched at the end of February!</p>
        <p>Sunday 18th January</p>
        <p>It was calm, but cloudy and cold with a little drizzle for our walk to the newsagents this morning. I had to go over to Dad's since the dressing on his ear had come off. I managed to clean up the area around the wound and fix a new dressing in place. Hopefully it will hold until Tuesday. I, hopefully, secured the tail wheel on my model by twisting some wire around the pieces of heat-shrink tubing. I also did some more investigation into efi booting. I have discovered a utility called efibootmgr that is already installed. It prints (in the terminal) the boot manager order, so perhaps it will allow me to change them. We spoke with Paul et al and then with Victoria and Austin. It seems that Victoria is pregnant! This is quite a surprise. She is due in September.</p>
        <p>Monday 19th January</p>
        <p>I spent most of the day trying to sort out the dual boot of my laptop. However, I failed to get a power on or restart to boot into rEFInd; if left to its own devices it boots into Win8! I need to continually press the ESC key so as to get into the boot options. After lunch I walked to Bay's, set up her fourth remote power switch and brought her car back. I put it in our garage so that is will start tomorrow morning, even if the weather is very cold. I installed Phoenix R/C flight simulator on the newly recovered Win8.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 20th January</p>
        <p>A busy day. I started by taking Bay's car to Tesco to fill it with petrol. This was on my way to Dad's, where I noted his shopping list and then took him to the optician. We then made a return visit to the optician so as to take his old frames and choose a new pair. After lunch Angela toke Bay to the chiropodist and I took Dad to Worthing hospital to have his dressing changed. They were running 50 minutes late, so I was too late to take John Dibb to his IET talk at Falmer. I actually got there before him (he missed the turn off the A27), but his talk was very good and well received.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 21st January</p>
        <p>This morning I had a call from the hospital about an appointment for Dad on Friday to have his dressing changed. Then I e-mailed John to thank him for his talk yesterday and sent the attendance sheets to the IET HQ. I also installed a lot of updates to Win8 and changed the settings so that I will be asked before updates are downloaded. Angela went to the Sussex Produce Company for lunch with her walking club and then went on to table tennis. After lunch I resolved my issue with my transmitter and the simulator. I then started looking at interfacing a digital thermometer to an Arduino. I installed the OneWire library. Then I went to the Creativity Centre at Moulscombe to a STEM event.</p>
        <p>Thursday 22nd January</p>
        <p>Shopping day. That was the morning gone. Dad's dressing had come off, so I had to put a new one on. After lunch, while Angela was taking Bay her shopping, I sorted out the documents for Monday's DAG meeting. I also wired up my digital temperature sensor and loaded the sample sketch. It worked! I also sorted out starting the Arduino IDE from my account. By adding myself to some groups, the IDE can now see the USB port.</p>
        <p>Friday 23rd January</p>
        <p>We overslept slightly this morning, so I did not have time for a shower before needing to leave to take Dad to Worthing hospital to have his dressing changed we were 15 minutes early, so I went to buy him a paper. When I got back, the nurse was calling him! So he was finished early and we went to the model shop on the way back. Unfortunately, the wire rods that I bought are too narrow., so I either have to change them for wider rods or find clevis pins that can be screwed on to the narrower rods. I also bought some terminal strips, so I rewired my digital thermometer and tested it. Since it was cold but clear, we also went for quite a long walk. Angela had to go to the Tollgate to pay a deposit for the table tennis 'Christmas' lunch and go to Hyde Square to buy some eggs. So we went via the river bank and St Peter's church. We also returned on the river bank.</p>
        <p>Saturday 24th January</p>
        <p>Somehow, Angela hurt her leg last night while sitting on the sofa! However, it was a lot better this morning and, after a shower, our walk to the newsagents in Beeding was not too painful. Nevertheless, it was quite late by the time that we got back and so I did little other than read the paper before lunch. After lunch Angela went down to the church and I pruned the two small apple trees. They had not grown much last year (and did not produce any apples), so I only tidied them up. Afterwards I researched ways of producing a graph of my temperature measurements. I decided that some existing applications were too restrictive, that the Processing language was really too specific and so decided to try using Python. I started learning a little about the language structure and syntax.</p>
        <p>Sunday 25th January</p>
        <p>We walked to the newsagents as usual. Then I pruned the large apple tree. After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed and put on his washing. When we got home we spoke with Paul et al and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 26th January</p>
        <p>Today started with a journey to Brighton for a DAG meeting between 10 and 12. There were a lot of people at the meeting since there are a number of new staff in the PAO. There was also the new member of the Board of Governors. As usual, Steve Maycock drew the meeting to a close on time. Which was handy, since I was meeting Simon and Mark for lunch at Patching at 12:30. I was only five minutes late, but the others were all there, Simon, Mark, Steve Elliott and Jamie Stapleton. Afterwards I went to the model shop to change the control rods for others (which turned out to be the same as the originals) and two metal clevis pins.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 27th January</p>
        <p>While the piano was being tuned I made the new aileron connection rods. However, the aileron throw is still not as much as it should be! During the afternoon we took Dad to Worthing hospital to have his dressing changed I also installed some Python libraries and did some research on the plotting application. I also finally got through to the NS&amp;I phone line and arranged for a temporary password to be sent. It seems that I chose a password when I applied for the bond online.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 28th January</p>
        <p>I spent some of the morning investigating the aileron movement on my model. I could not see anything stopping the movement. I also re-initialised the ESC in the hope that it will prevent it running the motor when I switch off the receiver. After deciding to do a drawing to check the design of the differential servo wheel, I found that I needed to install what has replaced the Apple X11 app and then the latest version of Inkscape. The drawing confirmed that the wheel shown on the plan should work!</p>
        <p>Thursday 29th January</p>
        <p>Thursday again. We were fairly early, since we did not have to go to Dad's to get his list. After lunch I finished making an experimental servo wheel, a little larger than the previous. And it worked! Plenty of aileron throw in both directions. So I used some epoxy to fix the relatively thin plastic 'wheel' to the servo arm, covering the wire that held them together.</p>
        <p>Friday 30th January</p>
        <p>Today I completed the aileron servo linkage on my model and continued to research the display of temperature, read by an Arduino, on a scrolling plot. I updated my Cub build blog, having firstly to charge my camera battery since the light level was too low for my phone camera. I also received my temporary NS&amp;I online password and so I was able to buy a 3-year 65+ bond. We have now both applied for a 1-year and a 3-year bond. This afternoon Angela went to a WI science talk on conservation of fabric by someone from Polesden Lacy NT house.</p>
        <p>Saturday 31st January</p>
        <p>We dressed up in our waterproofs to walk to the newsagents this morning, although it had stopped raining by the time that we left the house! Then, the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon was spent doing the weekly and monthly accounts. It took longer than usual because it was the end of the first month (and so I had to set up the analysis equations) and I needed to add the NS&amp;I 65+ bonds. I had an e-mail to say that my 3-year bond had been set up. One of Angela's cheques had been cashed, so we are assuming that she has her two bonds. Afterwords I spent some time trying to understand the Python code that draws a scrolling graph of analogue values against time. It is hard going!</p>
