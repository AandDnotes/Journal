        <p>Tuesday 1st September</p>
        <p>This morning some time was spent doing the monthly accounts. I also dipped the other side of the radiator bracket (for a short while) and then this afternoon gave it a coat of black Hammerite. This should have been touch dry in 30 minutes, but was still wet three hours later! The paint is over 25 year old. Also this afternoon, while Angela worked in the garden I cleared out the gutters.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 2nd September</p>
        <p>By this morning, the paint on my radiator bracket had still not completely dried. So I wiped it with some thinners and a little later gave it a second coat. We will see what it is like in the morning. Meanwhile Angela went walking and brought her WI friends back for coffee. After lunch we went to Holmebush to do the weekly shop, taking Dad with us. Then Angela took Bay's shopping to her while I cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Thursday 3rd September</p>
        <p>We started the day by going to Haywards Heath, to the dermatology clinic. At 10:30 I had some PDT cream put on my shoulder and at 1:30 I had the light treatment. In between we had coffee in a cafe in the park and then lunch in another cafe. We were home by 2:30. The MG parts that I had ordered from the Octagon Club had arrived and taken in by Terry. All are present. In preparation for tomorrow's SRFC meeting I stuck together one quarter of the fuselage sheet of the Tiger Moth plan, to see if I can get any advice on my planned build project.</p>
        <p>Friday 4th September</p>
        <p>Most of my day was spent in the garage, while Angela spent the morning in Steyning, at the church and at Bay's and the afternoon in the garden. She finished cutting the grass and pruned the rose on the frame by the greenhouse. It took me most of the day, but I managed to change the engine mounts on the MG. After an early dinner I went to the SRFC meeting. I saw Les's part-built Fokker biplane and got some tips on my plan to build a Tiger Moth.</p>
        <p>Saturday 5th September</p>
        <p>Another day with a lot of time spent in the garage. After our usual Saturday morning walk to the Beeding newsagents, Angela went into the garden and I started trying to put the radiator back into the MG. I discovered that the radiator had been mounted incorrectly, with both rubber rings on top of the chassis bracket and an extra rubber ring underneath. This means that the radiator is 1/4&quot; higher than it should be. However, if I remove one of the rings, the mount point for the bonnet will be too low. So I installed both the new rings on the top of the chassis and put the old, lower rings in some brake fluid to soak over night. Later in the day I continued to cut branches out of the laurel bush.</p>
        <p>Sunday 6th September</p>
        <p>It was the MG South Downs Run today. I arrived at the Western Lawns in Eastbourne at 9:30 and helped set up, then helped Marshall the cars. 200 had set off from Whiteways Lodge. Finally we cleared up and I got home at 6:30. Luckily it was fine and sunny for most of the day, if not always that warm. After dinner we spoke to Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 7th September</p>
        <p>This morning, before we took Bay to the dentist, I cleaned the original lower rubber elements (after they had soaked in brake fluid for 24 hours) and fitted them under the flanges on the chassis. I also re-fitted the temperature sensor and tightened the radiator stays. Then I had a short practice on the flight simulator before we went round to Bay's. We pushed her to the dentist in the wheel chair. After lunch we went over to Dad's. We cut his grass and pruned a couple of bushes. Before we went to Bay's, the postman brought the MG manuals from Ron in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 8th September</p>
        <p>I started trying to put together the radiator and its shell. However, the various fittings will not line up. After lunch we walked to Bay's and took her to the dentist. Later, after dinner, I went to the MGCC natter at Nuthurst. I had a good chat with Brian and Alan.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 9th September</p>
        <p>Following last night's discussion with Alan, I removed the radiator and took away one of the rubber rings from the top of the chassis bracket and put it underneath in place of the original rubber. However, there does not seem to be any way to adjust the angle of the radiator (to make it at right angles to the bonnet hinge) since the bottom bolts will not move and the top is fixed by the top hose. After lunch, Angela went to table tennis (the first of the season) and I went to The Globe school in Lancing to help run a Barefoot workshop.</p>
        <p>Thursday 10th September</p>
        <p>This week we got to Dad's a little earlier this week to go shopping. As usual, we started with coffee and then did the shopping, getting home reasonably early. After lunch Angela went in the garden and I went into the garage. I tightened the bolts under the radiator and connected the top braces, having adjusted their length, reducing them by about 1/4&quot;. I then put the shell in place and fitted the joining pieces between the wing braces and the radiator. I had to loosen the radiator bracket so as to get the off-side joining piece to fit, and then tighten them all up. Then I put in the bolts that hold the shell to the radiator. Quite a successful day, provided that the bonnet fits!</p>
        <p>Friday 11th September</p>
        <p>Whilst Angela went to Steyning and the dentist I caught up with some e-mail, downloading of photos and printing train schedules for our trip to California. Just before lunch we drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Worthing. We started with fish &amp; chips in Harry Ramsdens, then I bought some shoes and we bought books and various presents to take with us or to send people. We got home a little before six. Mark e-mailed me to say that Simon's wife died today.</p>
        <p>Saturday 12th September</p>
        <p>Following our usual walk to the newsagents I worked on the MG. I glued the loose dowel into which the bonnet attachment fitting is screwed, filling both holes with some slivers of wood. After lunch, while Angela took Bay to the garden centre, I did the accounts and printed the remaining pages of the first sheet of the Tiger Moth plan. When Angela got home she helped me lift the bonnet on to the car. It did not fit! So we took it off and it loosened all the bolts I could, including those under the wings holding the wing stays to the radiator. I was then able to move the top of the radiator forward a little, extending the radiator stays on both sides. After tightening all the bolts and the top radiator hose we lifted the bonnet in place again. It seems to fit. I will screw/bolt it in place tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Sunday 13th September</p>
        <p>After a walk to the newsagents I fixed the bonnet to the MG and refilled the radiator. After lunch I took the car off the axle stands, started the engine and drove to the BP garage at Beeding to get some petrol (the low level light was on). I tightened the jubilee clips on the two hoses that had been disturbed After talking to the children I also topped up the carburettor dash-pots and aligned the headlights and fog lamp.</p>
        <p>Monday 14th September</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went to help with the lunch club, I replied to the DAG meeting papers and went over to Dad's. We changed his bed and did his washing. We cooked fish, chips and peas for lunch before I came home. Then I started documenting my work on the MG, actually spending more time trying to work out how to arrange photos and text as I wanted. After tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting, where someone from Littlehampton museum, who spoke about the postcards of Donald McGill.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 15th September</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning, I taxed the Panda, told nmba that we were going the U.S. and topped up my mobile. After lunch Angela went to a WI committee meeting and I drove the MG to Field Place for an RCEA meeting. It was soon obvious that the engine was idling too fast and the indicators turned on, but did not flash! However, in spite of very slow traffic and coming back over the Bostal, the engine did not overheat. It was also the first time that I had driven the car with all the side screens on. But the driver's door screen does not fit well.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 16th September</p>
        <p>This morning Angela's sore throat has turned into a streaming cold. I spent a god amount of time in the garage tinkering with the MG. I found that the outer sheath of the slow-running cable simply slots into a hole and it was not pushed right in. This probably happened when I was checking the running of the engine. I also pushed the connectors further on to the flasher relay and the indicators now flash. In addition I did a little bending of the offside side screens so that they fit a little better. This afternoon I went, with George, to Steyning Grammar to talk to the IT and physics teachers about how we could help support them.</p>
        <p>Thursday 17th September</p>
        <p>We were not exactly early starting out to do the weekly shop. Nevertheless we started with coffee in M&amp;S and bought food, both there and in Tesco. So we were quite late getting home and having lunch. While Angela took Bay's shopping to her I started gluing the rest of the pages together that make up the first page of a Tiger Moth model plan.</p>
        <p>Friday 18th September</p>
        <p>Apart from getting my hair cut, I seem to have done little today. I printed the pages of the second sheet of the Tiger Moth plan and completed the documentation of the radiator mounted bracket clean-up, although I still have the engine mounts replacement to document. I spent some time examining the first sheet of the plan, trying to work out where I could install a battery.</p>
        <p>Saturday 19th September</p>
        <p>In spite of having a heavy cold, Angela went to Guildford to meet Carroll and June. She got back just in time for me to go to Bay's to take her to the Music Society concert. It was all baroque music played on period instruments and was very good. During the day I walked to the newsagents, did the accounts, trimmed the pages of the second sheet of the Tiger Moth plan and finished documenting my work on the MG.</p>
        <p>Sunday 20th September</p>
        <p>Angela, still suffering from a cold and cough, was helping with a 'Harvest lunch' at church. As I got home from the newsagents, so she was just leaving. I then had a fairly busy day. I started by uploading the MG files to my web site, then started gluing together the pages of the second sheet of my Tiger Moth plan. After lunch I removed the side screens form the MG, lowered the hood and drove to Dad's, via the Bostal. The car went up the hill quite well. In fact it was easier than coming down the hill! I cut his grass and started sorting out what he needs to pack for his visit to Alan's. Although the slow running problem was solved, on the way back the indicators stopped flashing again. They were fine on the way there. I will probably need to get a new flasher relay. Just before dinner we spoke with Victoria. If her labour does not start by Friday they will start to induce it.</p>
        <p>Monday 21st September</p>
        <p>This morning I took Dad for his hospital appointment, where Mr Pratt decided that Dad could be handed back to Dr Ali in Dermatology. We then spent some time sorting out his trousers, putting those that were too small around the waist in the spare room cupboard. We then turned his bed clothes over and put on some washing containing things he will need to pack. After lunch Angela went to a WI meeting, while I finished sticking together the pages of the second sheet of the Tiger Moth plan and started looking at extending my 'notes' web site. I decided to try to reproduce the existing iWeb-generated page, got stuck quite early on.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 22nd September</p>
        <p>This morning I refreshed my memory on the Barefoot workshop and then went to help Terry connect his iPad to his printer. After lunch I removed the tonneau floor to investigate the side screen box. I cleaned the glue off the side screen cover and noticed that there are corrosion holes in the front panel of the box. There also seems to be wood across the bottom, when I thought it should be steel. I e-mailed Stewart Penfound to ask if it is easy to replace it.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 23rd September</p>
        <p>Not a very productive morning. I completed my renewal for the Octagon Club and sent that off. Otherwise I just dealt with e-mail. Mick Landmann brought the teacher packs and BeeBots and this afternoon I ran the workshop at Washington. There were 10 teachers plus the head (part time) and one of the teacher's husbands! At 5:30, Victoria posted a message to say that she had gone into hospital to start inducing the baby, although she thought that it was ready to come out.</p>
        <p>Thursday 24th September</p>
        <p>Brandon posted a photo and message at about 8:30 this morning saying that Juniper Autumn had been born just before midnight (on the autumn equinox), weighing in at seven pounds one and a half ounces. Apart from her length (47cm) we don't know any more. We downloaded the photo to show to Dad and Bay. After breakfast we went over to Dad's. I collected his tablets and sorted out his request for another lot at the doctor's surgery. We had asked him to collect his tablets from the chemist, but he had found another copy of his repeat prescription and had taken it to the surgery, saying that he was going away of Friday! Meanwhile, Angela compiled his shopping list and we went off to Holmebush, starting with coffee. We also collected some slippers that we had bought on line from Next. After lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her and I worked out roughly where to put the battery in my Tiger Moth conversion and experimented with some html. I then cooked dinner while Angela prepared for tomorrow's coffee morning.</p>
        <p>Friday 25th September</p>
        <p>So far there has been no further posts about Juniper or Victoria. We had a fairly early start, with Angela going down to the the church to run a MacMillan coffee morning. I took the rest of her things down a little later, when I had finished my shower. I then went to the doctor's and was given a stronger form of steroid cream and some more Epederm cream. The doctor was running 30 minutes late, just 90 minutes into the day! From there I went to the bank to pay in the chequers and get Bay her cash. Then it was time for me to have coffee and cake. Angela made about &#163;185 for the charity. After lunch I took a box of of Bay's things to a charity shop while Angela did some food shopping. We then took Bay's cases and quite a lot of bush prunings to the tip. We went on to Speedy Spares to buy a flasher relay and looked in Sainsbury's unsuccessfully for an advent calendar.</p>
        <p>Saturday 26th September</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went for the paper (and some potatoes) and I stayed at home in case Mick Landmann called for the Barefoot equipment/folders. Actually he did not call until after lunch and I took the box down to him at the Chequers. Otherwise, I installed the new flasher relay in the MG and did the weekly accounts. The flasher seemed to work. We will have to see if it continues to work, since the old one starts out working, but then fails to flash. Later in the afternoon, when most of the dampness on the grass had dried, I cut the front and rear grass. In the process I lost one of the locking hand-nuts that hold the handle on. I found the washer, but not the nut. So I put on another nut until we find the original one. In the middle of mowing the grass we spoke to (and saw) Victoria, with Juniper asleep on her. They came home yesterday evening. I also ordered some US dollars for collection on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Sunday 27th September</p>
        <p>Once again Angela walked to the newsagents on her own. This time I was collecting Dad and driving him (and his suitcase) to Cobham services to meet Alan. We arrived at 10:45, bought a coffee and Alan arrived, with a coffee that he had just bought. We spent about an hour talking and I got home just before one o'clock. This afternoon We worked in the garden. I cut the top off the bush just behind the laurel. After dinner we spoke with Paul and then with Victoria. We saw Juniper sleeping and then requesting more food!</p>
        <p>Monday 28th September</p>
        <p>Last night I got up at about 2:45 and saw that the lunar eclipse had started I took some photos of the moon just before it was completely eclipsed (at about three o'clock). The images are very small. Whilst outside, I heard the sound of shattering glass, not once, but about four times. I phoned 101 and the police officer said that they already knew about it and that someone was on their way. I didn't hear any more about it. Then it took a long time to get back to sleep, so we were up late this morning. While Angela went down to Steyning to get some cash for our holiday and go to the butchers, I called PDH to, eventually, book the Panda in for a service when we get back. I also e-mailed people about the bookings for the PV talk at Falmer. After lunch we took the MG to Henfield so that Angela could pay her coffee morning money into the bank. I also started sizing the motor and servos for the Tiger Moth.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 29th September</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went off to sort out her WI finances while I did a few odds and ends. After lunch we walked down to Steyning to collect the US dollars that we had ordered. We also went to the chemist and the library. On the way home I met Paul, who lives at 35 Goring Road and has spent the last six years restoring a cream MG TF. He invited me round when we get back. Then I worked on my trips web site before going to the IET committee meeting in Crawley. I was persuaded to become the Vice Chairman, with a view to become Chairman when Kate gives up the job in a year's time.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 30th September</p>
        <p>Today was really about getting ready for our holiday. We put out the things to pack Before lunch I obtained a DVLA access code and after lunch I checked us in and printed our bonding cards. Angela went to Steyning this morning and then went to table tennis this afternoon. I met her afterwards and we went to Bay's for a cup of tea. After dinner I packed the cases.</p>
