        <p>Monday 1st June</p>
        <p>A fairly low-key birthday. During the morning I worked on my Scratch to Arduino interface on Windows. After lunch I went to Dad's while Angela went to a WI committee meeting. I 'turned over' Dad's bed and cleared out his front gutter. We had a 'special' lunch of fish and chips! Then after an early tea we went to Chichester theatre to see the musical 'Damsel in Destress'. It was very enjoyable (particularly for only &#163;10 per ticket) in spite of the wet, rainy weather on the way home.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 2nd June</p>
        <p>This morning I delivered Angela, in the rain and the wind, to the Tesco car park in Durrington to catch the coach to go to the palace; Buckingham Palace! I then spent most of the rest of the day woking on my installation of the Scratch to Arduino interface software on Windows. I managed to get it working and then documented it on my projects web site. We were expecting Angela to be back at Durrington by about seven.. The coach did not get back until 8:30! So we did not start eating dinner until 9:30. However, Angela kept dry and had a good day, even though not a lot happened at the garden party.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 3rd June</p>
        <p>Angela went off walking this morning with her WI group while I completed documenting my Windows installation of s2a_fm and had a long flying practice on the simulator. My flying of an electric Cub was pretty erratic. I also started looking at how to update my web sites. Angela was quite late back from her walk and doing some shopping in Steyning and after lunch we walked to Bay's. I put her cushion cover back on and Angela did a few jobs.</p>
        <p>Thursday 4th June</p>
        <p>Dad was not feeling very well and so didn't come shopping with us this morning, but at least Angela felt better. Whilst Angela took Bay's shopping to her this afternoon I found the problem with my modification to one of my web pages. It seems that iWeb built each piece of text as a text box, with an absolute definition of its position! Afterwards I built another Scratch program to read the three inputs from my 'control' Arduino and display them. I hope to use this to demonstrate the concept of sensors. I hope to use this to demonstrate the concept of sensors. I also did the monthly accounts. This took quite some time, since I was trying to find out how to transfer cash from Angela's Equinity account into our current account. I ended up leaving a message.</p>
        <p>Friday 5th June</p>
        <p>This morning I went to George's to work on the ASI workshop. We managed to get the infra-red camera working and downloaded the viewer software. After lunch we went to Bay's and washed her car, in the hope that Michael will take it when he visits on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Saturday 6th June</p>
        <p>It was a typical Saturday morning, a walk to the newsagents at Beeding bridge, followed by reading some of the paper and doing the weekly accounts. Angela spent most of the day in the garden, while I only trimmed the sides of the laurel bush (which has to be done using secateurs so as not to cut the leaves). I also updated my slides for a Process Automation presentation. I will use it at Steyning Grammer (if asked to help) and a subset at Dorothy Springer. I also added another 'hanger' from the garage ceiling so that I can put shorter items up there.</p>
        <p>Sunday 7th June</p>
        <p>After our walk to Beeding newsagents I started going through some of the contents of the garage. After lunch we went over to Dad's. I cut his grass while Angela washed his windows (and frames). When we got home we spoke to Victoria and then to Paul. I also discovered that the TC in the Brooklands Historics auction went for &#163;26,880.</p>
        <p>Monday 8th June</p>
        <p>An almost totally wasted day! I had arranged to go to Coys in Richmond to look again at (and test drive) an MG TC. So I set off at ten to eleven, stopped for lunch (I took some lunch) in Richmond Park before going on to Coys. But the TC was still in the showroom and the salesman I had been emailing and with whom I had agreed a likely offer was away sick! No one else knew that I was coming, but the phoned the salesman. They then said that the offer of &#163;22,000 was too low to warrant them getting the car out. They indicated that others were interested and so they were expecting it to sell for more. If I wanted to up my offer then they would get it out for a test drive. I told them that they had wasted my time and that I was not prepared to offer any more. So I left and got home at three thirty.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the afternoon buying ISA and putting some money into a savings account.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 9th June</p>
        <p>I started the day with a haircut. Then I cut the front grass before lunch and the rear grass after lunch. I lowered the mower by one notch, which was a mistake since it took off a lot of grass. After dinner I spoke to Chris about his MG TC. He will send me some photos. The car was brought back from the US and restored by the then owner. Chris has put back a lot of original/reproduction parts over the past three years that were changed while in the US. He also had it re sprayed from white.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 10th June</p>
        <p>Today was Bay's 100th birthday. This afternoon we took Bay to West Dean gardens for a cream tea and a push around the garden. We then brought her home for dinner.</p>
        <p>Thursday 11th June</p>
        <p>Dad came shopping with us today. We also changed his bed and did his washing. After lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her, while I cleared e-mail and experimented with the DAG SharePoint site and app, adding annotations and finally losing my downloads and access to the documents! I also tried to get a house insurance quote, without success, and phoned Chris Hall to arrange to view his TC on Saturday. Finally, I ran through the DAG papers again.</p>
        <p>Friday 12th June</p>
        <p>This morning was the DAG meeting at Moulescomb. Sam had a hard time and I think was quite put out. The University is spending more on fundraising than the funds raised! It was suggested that that they should focus more and use less of a 'scatter-gun' approach. They were also asked to do more work promising a data pack and prevented from starting talks with the Diageo Foundation. After lunch I got another quote for house buildings and contents insurance, cancelled the two Halifax policies and the direct debits and bought the Sainsbury's policy. It was less than half price (at least for this year). I also updated the weekly accounts and bought our Dartford crossing tolls for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Saturday 13th June</p>
        <p>Today was a day to note in the diary. This morning we set off for Little Clacton in Essex, stopping at Coggeshall for lunch and to look at an NT barn. At Little Clacton I viewed, was driven in and then bought a 1948 MG TC for &#163;24,650! The owner, Chris Hall had a four-car garage containing the TC, a Morris Minor and a Ford Prefect 107E! There was also a modern car, as well as his main car, which was on the drive along with a large caravan. I paid a deposit and now need to move the remaining money and work out how to get it home. It is 125 miles from here, on nasty roads (M23, M25, A12), so I might find out what it would cost to get it transported.</p>
        <p>Sunday 14th June</p>
        <p>Apart from a walk to the Beeding newsagents (and on to the garage because the newsagents had run out of Telegraphs), I've not done much other than sit in front of the computer. I moved money into the current account and searched for some people who offer car transportation services. I also downloaded some photos on to the iPad to show Dad tomorrow. Later we also spoke with Victoria and Paul. I have to confess that I also researched negative earth conversions and bulkhead foot plates as well as starting to look at the TC instruction manual.</p>
        <p>Monday 15th June</p>
        <p>This morning I found someone who would collect the TC, on Saturday, and take me with them, for &#163;280. Before I had a check-up at the dentist, I tried and failed to make an appointment to see a doctor, bought some ball-valve washers and checked with the bank that I could transfer &#163;25K in one go, free of charge and within 24 hours. Chris gave me his bank details to use later in the week. I also obtained an insurance quote from the RAC, which was higher than I expected. After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting and I loaded some things from the garage into the car and took them to the tip in Shoreham. Then I went on to Dad's for a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 16th June</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time today in the garage, sorting out things to throw away and vacuuming around the edges. Angela went down to Steyning before lunch and went round to Bay's this afternoon. Meanwhile I got another insurance quote from Hagerty for the TC and then phoned Heritage, the same company used by Chris. The last one was the cheapest, so I accepted it. I also registered for Totally T-types. I also set up Brandon's drip-feed watering system, but could not get it to start pumping.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 17th June</p>
        <p>Today was a combination of trying to get the greenhouse watering system working and continuing to make space in the garage. I took some stuff to the tip this morning and called into Dad's to fill his pill box in case I did not get there tomorrow. However, I heard nothing from Sarah at STEM Sussex, so I assume that I am not needed at Steyning Grammar tomorrow. After lunch I did some more vacuuming (until the vacuum stopped working), filled two bags with more things for the tip and removed and dismantled one of the shelving units. There is still a lot to be done. We will also see in the morning if the drip-feed pump is performing as it should. Angela went walking this morning and then went with her table tennis ladies to the Artisan Bakery this afternoon for a cream tea. They thought that it was over-priced!</p>
        <p>Thursday 18th June</p>
        <p>I heard nothing from STEM Sussex or Steyning Grammar about their careers day, so I went shopping with Angela. However, we first went into Steyning to the bank to transfer the TC money to Chis. But they failed to do it! They needed a second teller to authorise the transfer, but the other girl was not accepted. However, they said that the daily limit had been raised from &#163;10,000 to &#163;50,000. So we came home and used Angela's PINsentry to transfer the money. Although the transfer was accepted, it was delayed until tomorrow so that checks could be made! When I phoned their support line they said that 5% of transactions had to be checked, but it would be completed tomorrow. Normally it takes about two hours for an online transfer to be completed, but they say it will take up to 24 hours so as to cover these checks. So we went shopping a little later than planned. Dad came with us and we started with coffee. He and I then did the food shopping in M&amp;S and the Tescos while Angela changed some T-shirts in Marks and then caught us up. After lunch, Angela took Bay's food to her and I completed rearranging the garage. After dinner I phoned Chris to give him an update.</p>
        <p>Friday 19th June</p>
        <p>A tiring day. I started by loading the old metal cupboard and other rubbish into the car and taking it to the tip at Shoreham. I then fixed a wooden bracket to the wall and hung up the second ramp. The garage vacuum would still not work. I took it apart and checked the fuse, cable and switch. The foam rubber inside had perished, but I could see no evidence of the fault. I checked our bank account and found that the TC money had gone. I then had a call from Chris Hall to say that the money had arrived in his account. After lunch we walked down to Steyning. I took some things into a charity shop and then went to the doctor's about the spot on my scalp. Dr Creek thinks that it is not cancerous, but is obliged to refer me to the community dermatology group. Meanwhile, Angela had been clearing out the top shed and had more stuff for the tip. So we went to Shoreham again, taking the vacuum with us. On the way back we called into Tesco to get strawberries and sugar for jam.</p>
        <p>Saturday 20th June</p>
        <p>Today started as usual for a Saturday. We walked to the newsagents in Beeding. But at 11 o'clock a car transported arrived and we set off for Little Clacton. We didn't stop and arrived there at twenty to two. The TC was loaded while I completed the paperwork with Chris and we set off at 2:15. We had a very short stop at the Shell garage in Henfield and got home at 4:30. I then drove the car into the garage; backwards, taking some photos of it first.</p>
        <p>Sunday 21st June</p>
        <p>After a walk to the newsagents and on to the BP garage I checked the oil, water and tyres on the TC. Then I spent quite some time lowering the hood and trying to fold it. It does not seem to be made in the way that is described in the manual, and so will not fold as described. John was over to look at the car before I had even got it out of the garage! After putting on the tonneau cover (to a fashion) I drove it to the BP garage at Beeding. I had marked 50 ml on a small jar and put this much additive in before putting ten litres of unleaded petrol in the tank. When I got back, Neil (and Tom and Ben, plus a friend) came over and Terry soon followed! After lunch we drove the TC to Dad's to cut his grass and change his bed. When we got home the brakes seemed to be stuck on, perhaps due to the fluid getting hot. I also bent the rear offside wing when reversing into the garage! Then we spoke with Victoria (Austin was being uncooperative) and Paul (Rowan was very boisterous).</p>
        <p>Monday 22nd June</p>
        <p>An early start. Hamish (and George) picked me up at ten to seven and drove us to Hastings. We ran the ASI workshop at Hastings College from 9:30 until 12:30. We had 21 students, although we lost some during the break! Overall it seemed successful, even though we did not have time to run the camera activities twice. We stayed for lunch and were home by 3:30. This afternoon Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and to the garden centre.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 23rd June</p>
        <p>I started the day intending to put the TC up on axle stands. However, I only managed this morning to investigate the foot brake adjustment (which looked fine), take off the spare wheel (and put it on again) and remove and replace one rear wheel. After lunch I took Angela to Worthing hospital to have her ears checked. I went on to Hamish's house to pick up my coat. I saw his Triumph Gloria.before going back to the hospital to pick up Angela. We walked to Waitrose for a cup of tea before coming home. I also completed an Octagon Club application form and spoke to the membership secretary of the West Sussex MG Owners Club.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 24th June</p>
        <p>Angela went walking this morning while I cut the grass (well most of it, I had to finish it after lunch). After lunch Angela went to the funeral of one of her table tennis players. Meanwhile I managed to put the TC up on axle stands. I needed to use two bottle jacks at the rear and the trolley jack at the front. Luckily I found that the steering is light when the wheels are off the ground. The brake master cylinder, however, is still quite inaccessible, even when the car is on stands. I took the offside front wheel off, but it was not obvious how to remove the brake drum. A job for tomorrow. With the garage door open, it wasn't long before both John and Terry called in! I also tried to set up the automatic watering system in the greenhouse. However, the pump in the unit would not run this time. So I took it all out and put in a gravity fed drip-feed system, that was also left by Brandon. We will see if it is up to the job.</p>
        <p>Thursday 25th June</p>
        <p>A pretty standard format for Thursday morning. We went to Dad's to make out his shopping list and then took him off to Holmbush, starting with a cup of coffee in Marks. Since we are going to Cornwall on Sunday for a week we had to buy both Dad and Bay extra food. In fact their lists were longer than ours and for once Angela completed our list before Dad and I finished the others. However, we were not too late getting home. After lunch Angela took Bay's thing to her and I played with the TC, removing each of the brake drums in turn. The brakes on all four wheels were fine, although they were binding a little on the rear near side, even when I had them fully slackened off. But the drums (which are cast iron) were not scored and there was no sign of leakage from the slave cylinders. There was also no evidence of oil from the back axle contaminating the brake drums. I also took the opportunity to grease all the steering gear points, with the exception of the lower nipple on the near side kingpin. All-in-all, a good day's work.</p>
        <p>Friday 26th June</p>
        <p>I printed off a map to help find the holiday cottage on Sunday, but spent the rest of the morning playing with the TC, while Angela made cakes to take on holiday. Whereas I thought that the lower grease nipple on the near side kingpin needed to be turned in order to get the grease gun on to it, I realised that all I had to do was turn the wheel'! However, I still couldn't get grease into it, even though the nipple itself was fine. I also wanted to check the oil in the steering box, but all my imperial scanners are too lose on the nuts and bolts. I will probably need to buy some new sockets and spanners, perhaps second hand. So I took the car off the axle stands and, after lunch, took it for a short run, just going down Clays Hill, through Bramber and Beeding, along the bypass and back up Clays Hill. I guess in total about three miles. When I got home I reversed into the garage, jacked up the front wheels and checked them for binding. Both where binding badly! So I suspect that it is the pressure relief hole in the master cylinder getting covered by the piston rubber. I then experimented further with the hood and re packed the side screens. The new hood does not appear to conform to the original design! I also wiped over the linings and upholstery with a damp cloth and discovered that the original horn does not work (thus the new plastic one under the bonnet). Meanwhile, Angela helped at a 'messy' event for children at the Penfold hall. I managed a quite go on the flight simulator and played the piano before she came home.</p>
        <p>Saturday 27th June</p>
        <p>A day of doing bits and bobs. We walked to Hyde Square to get some bread and a paper (the Co-op is closed for refurbishment) and then, while Angela tidied things in the garden I put out my things to pack. I also did the weekly accounts before lunch. Afterwards we went to Dad's to top up his pill box. When we got home, Angela put a casserole in the oven and we then took Sam to the cattery. Then we had a chat with Victoria before we started packing up in earnest.</p>
        <p>Sunday 28th June</p>
        <p>We left home at nine o'clock and after twenty miles ran into the traffics jams on the A27 for the Goodwood Festival of Speed! After spending 20 minutes in the queue we came to a road that looked promising and so we diverted around the jam. We stopped at a service area on the M27 for coffee and then stopped at a Tesco at Dorchester for lunch. But they did not have a coffee shop and so we bought a sandwich and ate it in the car! The traffic was heavy on the A31, but improved from just before Dorchester. So we had a very brief stop just after Bodmin and arrived at the cottage park at 4:30, after 266 miles. It is a very good little cottage, with superb views. After a cup of tea and unpacking, we walked along an old tram track to Portraeth. We thought it would take 20 minutes, but it took 40 minutes to get to the beach. After looking around we went into the Basset Arms for a meal, before walking back. My hake with ham was very good, but Angela's salmon cakes were a bit bland.</p>
        <p>Monday 29th June</p>
        <p>After a leisurely breakfast and a shower we drove to the Tesco store in Redruth, just five minutes away. As well as some food for lunches we bought two folding chairs for only &#163;10 the two. We had started our lunch when Paul, Krista and Rowan arrived. They had driven from a friend's farm in Devon. After lunch, and several trips to the play area, we went for a short walk along the tram track and then ordered pizzas from the mobile pizza oven that was on site, although Rowan hardly eat anything.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 30th June</p>
        <p>A warm, bright, sunny day, although there was quite a strong wind from the East. After a leisurely breakfast and show we made a packed lunch and drove down to Portraeth, complete with bucket and spade. We spent the morning on the beach, paddling and having our lunch, getting back to the cottage mid afternoon. Later we walked down the tram track to Bridge and went to the Bridge Inn for dinner. A bit of a dump, so we ate in the garden (across the car park and next to the river). The food was passable, but only just.</p>
