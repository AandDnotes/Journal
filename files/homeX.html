It is intended only to be read by me; a sort of aid memoir to help my poor memory.</p>
        <p>I set up this format in 2018, so years prior to that have one page per month. From 2018 onwards there is one page per day. There are few photos with us both and usually those have other people. This one was taken in January 2007 at Victoria's and Brandon's wedding in Gainesville, Florida.</p>
        <p>It would be good to have a search capability on this page. However, at least for the time being, I can search in the repository on GitHub.</p>
