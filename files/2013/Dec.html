        <p>1 December 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>We spent the day at Paul's. We had a fairly early start (at about 9:30), played with Rowan, had lunch, talked and then walked into Twickenham to go to an Italian restaurant. It was about 10:15 pm before we got home.</p>
        <p>2 December 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A day spent mainly working on my RC project. I documented the breadboard Arduino ISP, looked at the RF module connector and started reading about SPI.<br />
        I also updated the monthly accounts and we tried out the security device that Barclays provided to Angela. However, we tried to set up a standing order on the 1-2-3 account and found that to do it online it was necessary to have a mobile phone registered in order to receive a transaction code.</p>
        <p>3 December 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>We caught the 10 o'clock bus to Worthing. Angela had a short list of things to look at. In practice we bought most of the Christmas presents and caught the last bus home.<br />
        Before dinner I soldered connections on to one of the voltage regulators and tested it after dinner (after modifying the breadboard layout so as to get the pins right).</p>
        <p>4 December 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Part of the morning was spent at Brighton, at the DAG meeting. However I was home for lunch.<br />
        After lunch, while Angela went to table tennis, I worked on my RF module pin conversion in parallel with producing more cine film conversion to a DVD. I put on as many clips as I could, so a few got left off. I left the Mac burning the DVD.<br />
        After dinner we walked down to Steyning, to the Christmas market. We just walked the length of the High Street and looked in a couple of the new shops.<br />
        When we got home we tried the DVD, which worked! Unfortunately some of the dates in the menu are wrong and some titles are two long. I also produced a label for the disc.</p>
        <p>5 December 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again. We started by going into Worthing to the bank and to M&amp;S before going to the model shop, to Argos and to Saisbury's. After lunch I wired up my Arduino/AWA24S/voltage regulator. But ,when checking, I realised that I had got the pins on the AWA24S the wrong way round. I then spent some time modifying the images of the device and trying to rework the breadboard layout.</p>
        <p>6 December 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I took the bus into Worthing to pick up the child booster seat from Argos and to change the shirt for Dad.<br />
        After lunch I finished redesigning my breadboard layout and wired it.<br />
        In the evening I went to the SRFC Christmas party at Lancing Leisure Centre. I sat with Les and Derek.</p>
        <p>7 December 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The day started with a walk into Steyning to collect two rolled Turkey breasts and take them to the Methodist Church. Angela put them in the oven for the lunch club on Monday. We walked back down later to put the cooled meat in the fridge.<br />
        Then I did the accounts and put back the kitchen floor, moving the cooker back into place.</p>
        <p>8 December 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After a walk to the newsagents in Beeding, the morning was spent reading the paper, having a short piano practice, a short flying practice (on the simulator) and a short while reading the AWA24S data sheet on its SPI support.<br />
        After lunch we went to Dad's. We persuaded him to change his cloths so that we could put them in the wash! We also changed his bed and did a wash. I also wrote out instructions on how to watch his cine film DVD.<br />
        On our return we found a message from Bay saying that her heating was not working. So we went round, with another fan heater. The boiler is not lighting. Someone is due to come tomorrow to look at it.</p>
        <p>9 December 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent writing Christmas cards; at least those in which I normally put a letter. This year I wrote a short note in each of the cards. I also wrote a letter to Cadburys about Dad's Liquorice Allsorts and the orange rubber finger stall that he seems to have found in the packet. Meanwhile, Angela was slaving away in the church kitchen for the lunch club's Christmas lunch. Unusually they had fewer people than expected!<br />
        After lunch I read more about the SPI communications on the AWA24S RF module, checked the wiring on my breadboard and started programming a simple sketch to start my testing. After tea I did my first test, to simply read the default value from a register. It worked!!!<br />
        We then had a FaceTime call from Victoria. They are safely back in Missouri.</p>
        <p>10 December 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Most of today was spent in the study working on my RC design. Firstly I modified my sketch to include a case that wrote to a register and read the contents back. After a little experimentation this also worked. I then spent a lot of time trying to understand how a string of bytes are written to the TX buffer (register file) and read from the RX buffer. I started analysing Dunc's code. It is in C and so I cannot understand it all, but I can see the structure. Angela went to a WI committee meeting this afternoon.<br />
        I also phoned Mark and arranged, in principal, to meet next week for lunch.</p>
        <p>11 December 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>What did I do today? Nothing that I can really put my finger on! I did some research on dipole antenna making and tried to track down someone who had an ElectriCub II kit available. But everyone seems to be out of stock and they all use Ripmax as their importer. It also took a while to find the connector that I need to connect my DIY antenna to to the lead from the AWA24S. I found that Maplin stock them! So it is a trip to Maplin and the model shop tomorrow.<br />
        I also made a list of the tasks that need to be performed to upgrade the kitchen, along with a plan of the outline of the kitchen.</p>
        <p>12 December 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Thursday again! The day of the weekly shop seems to come around very quickly. We had such an eRly start that we caught Dad just leaving his house for a walk to the corner shop to buy his paper. So we got into Worthing quite early. I bought some coax connectors from Maplin and we trawled the shops for chopping boards and trivets for Bay's Christmas present. Beals were having a 50% off sale and so a &#163;15 chopping board was only &#163;7:50. Then we went to M&amp;S before dropping in at the model shop to order my Piper Cub kit. We had some lunch in the middle of our shop at Sainsbury's. Then back to Dad's and on to Bay's before getting home at about 3:30.<br />
        After an early supper, Angela went off to the Partridge Green WI Christmas party.</p>
        <p>13 December 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to Steyning (for most of the morning) I spent quite a long time doing the ironing. Then this afternoon I soldered the components for my other RC device. This included cutting a board to convert the RF module socket to the same pitch as the rest of the modules. After that, I went to the dentist for a check-up and then did the weekly accounts (including checking off the entries in the bank statement. This was all done while Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and tot he garden centre.</p>
        <p>14 December 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We spent the day travelling to Victoria's, having fun with Austin and travelling home in time for tea.</p>
        <p>15 December 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The morning was spent mainly researching the configuration of the AWA24S.<br />
        After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and vacuum around.<br />
        Later I worked out how/where to define the PN code in the RF module.</p>
        <p>16 December 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Having cut up the board that we previously used under the Christmas tree, I had to cut a new, circular board and put it on the old laundry basket. Angela put up the cards and I wrapped a few presents.<br />
        I also spent a little time doing further research on the RF module.</p>
        <p>17 December 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Another couple of steps forward on the RC front. I managed to read data from a register file and then write data to a register file (and read it back).<br />
        After a late lunch I brought in the tree and we started putting up the decorations.</p>
        <p>18 December 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>We had an interesting trip to Chichester. We caught the ten o'clock bus from the centre of Steyning and got off at Southgate alibi toe before eleven. After coffee, we finished our Christmas shopping, had lunch in the Cathedral cafe, looked around some shops and caught the same bus back at ten to two. We were home by three thirty.</p>
        <p>19 December 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day! We started in Worthing, going to Maplin, M&amp;S, the bank and then to Morrison's. There, we had coffee and bought the weekly shop for Bay and Dad, before going back to Dad's with our sandwiches. We then went to Lyons Farm to do our shopping, before going to Bay's. Finally, after dinner, I did a little more present wrapping.</p>
        <p>20 December 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent wrapping Christmas presents.<br />
        This afternoon I worked on the initialisation of the CYRF7936, prior to trying to make it transmit. However, I discovered that I had assigned a signal to an analogue pin, but it needs to be an output! And I've used all the digital pins on the Pro Mini! But I had already been thinking of abandoning the idea of using the IRQ output from the RF module, since running an interrupt routine might disrupt the servo control. So I can use that PMW output.</p>
        <p>21 December 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We had quite a long walk this morning, to the newsagent in Beeding, then on to the pharmacy in Steyning and then to Bunces.<br />
        This afternoon we went to Dad's to change his bed and clean. We also checked his present wrapping.<br />
        In between I worked on my RC design. I'm now ready to try a trial transmission.</p>
        <p>22 December 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The day started with another quite long walk. This time to Hyde Square and to the Beeding newsagents on the way back. I then called Alan to arrange to meet him at the Chobham services at eleven o'clock on Boxing Day (and then agin the following Sunday), before having a shower. I worked on my RC design until Paul and Krista arrived. Whilst everyone was out during the afternoon I finished testing the transmission of data and then soldered on the headers so as to start making a second device. However, it looks as though the second FTDI module is not working.<br />
        Otherwise, we had a lot of entertainment from Rowan.</p>
        <p>23 December 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A surprising amount of progress was made on the RC front, considering that Krista and Paul are here. However, they did go down to Steyning this morning with Angela, which gave me some time on my own. I e-mailed Proto-Pic about the dead FTDI module and got a reply saying that they would send a replacement! I also finished the second breadboard and tested it with my SPI test sketch. Then I made my first antenna.<br />
        Otherwise, we had an entertaining day with Rowan.</p>
        <p>24 December 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>No progress on the RC today. Paul and I took Rowan to Steyning this morning to buy some milk. Then Victoria and Brandon arrived at about 3:30, having spent almost 3 hours travelling. We had dinner early and both children were very good. Victoria and Brandon then went to to bed with Austin! Meanwhile, Paul and Krista went out to meet friends in Henfield. Certainly by the time that the children went to bed we were quite tired! Rowan went straight to sleep, but Austin was still awake, watching 'Cars' on their iPad.</p>
        <p>25 December 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Christmas Day!<br />
        Exhausting, but fun (with Rowan and Austin).<br />
        It was a little overwhelming for them, but they did very well.</p>
        <p>26 December 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Boxing Day!<br />
        A relatively early start to Dad's to help him pack before we set off for the Cobham services on the M25. We arrived exactly at 11 o'clock, but Alan was delayed due to traffic. I left at 11:30 and arrived home at 1:45. Then I collected Auntie Bay so that Angela, Bay and I could have lunch. The others had eaten and Paul, Krista and Rowan were just leaving for the airport as we arrived. Their flight to Amsterdam seemed to be on time.</p>
        <p>27 December 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A difficult day. Austin was allowed to eat anything he wanted, when he wanted, where he wanted. Brandon spent most of the day with his iPad and went to bed while we we washing up! But Austin was wonderful.</p>
        <p>28 December 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Victoria et al left at ten. We spent the rest of the morning tidying up and then after lunch went into Worthing to get a new electric blanket, to Sainsbury's to buy a few bits of food and to Wickes and B&amp;Q to pick up kitchen brochures.</p>
        <p>29 December 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>This morning was spent collecting Dad from Cobham services. Unfortunately they were a little late, so it was 2 o'clock before I got home.<br />
        After a late lunch I soldered pins on the replacement FDTI module, tested it and e-mailed thanks to Proto-PIC. Then I stared work on a makeshift antenna mount.<br />
        After dinner we looked at kitchen suppliers.<br />
        Dad phoned to tell us that he had set fire to his kitchen again!</p>
        <p>30 December 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>It was raining and blowing a gale this morning, so we stayed at home. I made a second antenna.<br />
        After lunch we went to Alexamders and Wickes to look at kitchens. Then we called in to Dad's to inspect the damage to his kitchen.</p>
        <p>31 December 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning we took Dad to Worthing Hospital for his three-month check-up. We arrived half an hour before his appointment time and he was called in almost immediately. He was all done by twenty to ten; twenty minutes before his appointment time!<br />
        The rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly shop for Dad, Bay and us, including buying Dad a new microwave. Then we had lunch in Sainsbury's before taking Dad and his shopping home and cleaning up his kitchen.</p>
