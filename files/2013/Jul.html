        Monday</p>
        <p>The first day of my retirement! So we decided to go out for the day. Actually it was the only day this week on which neither of us has something already organised! So we went to Arundel in the morning. We didn't go into the town, but walked around the lake and then along the river. We stopped at the George and Dragon on the way home for some lunch, before going to PDH at Findon Valley to look at a Fiat Panda. We had a test drive and got a price for trading in the Modus.</p>
        <p>2 July 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Getting up at five thirty was not really my idea of retirement. However, it was the Big Bang South East event at Crawley and I had volunteered! Each of the volunteers had a rota, but I seemed to spend most of my time either walking coaches from the gate around to the registration tent or, later in the day, getting coaches loaded and escorted out. There were about 3,000 school children, plus staff, from all over the South East and an excellent collection of shows, exhibits and interactive displays.</p>
        <p>3 July 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>After writing a quick reply to Greg McKim I spent most of the morning doing the monthly accounts. There have been lots of comings and goings this past month and so it took a while to reconcile them all. In the afternoon we took Dad to Worthing to Santander to try to sort out his savings accounts. We ended up making another appointment for next week! We then took him to Morrisons for a cup of tea and to do his grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>4 July 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Today was the first day of my retirement on which I had nothing planned, although Angela had an appointment at the hygienist this afternoon. I spent the morning sorting through Dad's finances, trying to decide if the Santander 1-2-3 account would work for him. By my reckoning he should be about &#163;100/month better off. However, it just adds complication to his finances.<br />
        I spent a good part of the afternoon designing (or rarer copying the design of) a field box that will hold a fuel container, a 12V battery and all the paraphernalia needed for radio control flying. A &#163;7 piece of plywood should be enough to make something that costs &#163;35.<br />
        I then did a little bush trimming before dinner.</p>
        <p>5 July 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Today I spent from 9 o'clock until 12:30 up at the flying site with Alan Murray, my tutor. I had about five flights of my plane, mainly doing circuits, because there were other flyers. Although we were the first at the site, there were a dozen cars by the time that I left.<br />
        After lunch I went to the Health Centre for an abdominal aortic aneurism screening. All was fine. I saw the ultra-sound picture of my aorta! We then spent quite a lot of time watching the tennis. Djokovic beat Del Potro (just) in five sets. Murray is now playing (and losing to) a tall Pole (Janowicz) in the other semi-final. However, he (Murray) won!</p>
        <p>6 July 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Today was a family celebration of my retirement. The children came over in the morning and then we collected Bay and Dad and all went to the Tollgate for lunch. When we arrived, Brandon was already part-way through his starter and Victoria had her main course on a plate! Anyway, we all had desert at about the same time. It is difficult to keep in synch at a carvery. Afterwards we came back for coffee. Victoria went off early and Bay wanted to be home by three thirty to catch Mick the gardener. So I took her and Dad home. When I got back, Rowan was in the paddling pool in the garden! She had a good time waddling uncertainly around the garden.<br />
        Bay was too tired to go to the Music Society concert, so after a sandwich, Paul and Krista went home and we walked down to the Steyning Centre. A young (16) cellist and a small Japanese pianist were quite spectacular.<br />
        So a very enjoyable day, and a hot and sunny one too.</p>
        <p>7 July 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A quiet day today. After walking to the newsagents Angela went to church and I did the accounts! I also decided where we should move money and what shares we should buy. I opened a Post Office one year bond and moved money into Angela's share dealing account.<br />
        Whilst doing this I popped in and out of the front room to see how Murray was doing against Djokovic. To my surprise he won the first set. Then he was a break down in the second, but came back to win it. Then he was down in the third, but won!<br />
        Another gloriously hot and sunny day.</p>
        <p>8 July 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We bought a car! We went to Findon Valley this morning and put down a deposit on a white Fiat Panda. It is currently due for delivery in September. We chose white because it is the only colour that does not cost extra. The on,y option that we chose was a height adjustable driver's seat. On the way home I remembered that the Panda does not have a spare wheel as standard and so we had meant to order one as an option. So I needed to phone through the amendment.<br />
        Angela is helping at the lunch club today, although she is not cooking.<br />
        Closed the main ING account because the interest rate is now so low. Although the cleared funds in the bank seem to account for the money transferred into the share dealing account, the statement does not show it. So decided to wait before buying more shares.<br />
        Revised my design for a field box. Now I just need to try to build it!<br />
        Started washing down the gutters and facias, but only got part-way along the back.<br />
        Angela went to a string quartet concert, with puddings!</p>
        <p>9 July 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Spent the morning (at least from 10 till 12:30) up at the flying site. It was quite breezy, but I got in four flights of simple circuits. I am still in reaction mode, rather than 'commanding' the plane. When flying against the wind the plane was practically stationary, but then raced downwind. There were hints from Alan that I should become self-sufficient with regard to equipment. He would then be able to travel to the site on his motorbike. A fellow called Ollie was also there. He was hoping to take his solo test, using his small electric 'foamy'. However, the wind was too strong. His plane turned over as soon as he tried to take off.<br />
        Angela had a committee meeting this afternoon, so I spent a lot of time sorting out some finances. I (Angela) bought &#163;10,000 worth of shares and opened a tracker bond with the Halifax (that will take &#163;60,000).<br />
        Another hot and sunny day, but still very breezy.</p>
        <p>10 July 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Started the day by finishing washing down the facias and guttering at the back and then did the garage side and front, plus the little bit next to the garage. Still the rest of the front to do and the front and rear apex, if I can each them.<br />
        After lunch we then took Dad to Santander to open a new account. We closed two old accounts and arranged for his direct debits to be moved from Barclays to Santander. We still need to go to Barclays to arrange a standing order to pay money into the new account and to transfer some more money into it. I also need to open an online account for him so as to reduce the amount in his current account. We then took him to Waitrose to do his shopping and have a cup of tea.<br />
        After taking him home we went to Wickes to buy a sheet of plywood (for my field box) and to the model shop to buy all the engine starting equipment that I need. We then went to Currys to buy two SD cards, although I found that my mobile needs a micro SD card! However, they are fine for the Rasperry Pi and the camera.. We then went into B&amp;Q for some petrol additive for the mower. All-in-all a very busy afternoon (and an expensive one).<br />
        There was as little more cloud around this afternoon, but it was still very warm and quite breezy.</p>
        <p>11 July 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>A day with nothing arranged. Angela went to do the weekly supermarket shop for us and for Bay, but prefers me not to go with her! So I spent the morning finishing washing down the gutters/facias at the front. In the afternoon I assembled my newly acquired 'starting equipment', changing and adding connectors and making a temporary mount for the power panel. I then started the engine using the glow stick and starter. I also adapted a plastic milk bottle cap, which fits the fuel container, and tried the hand pump. So I''m ready for flying tomorrow morning.<br />
        After a cloudy start, the sun came out and I kept the garage door open all day.<br />
        During this, Auntie Bay had an 'emergency'. The cord on one of her blinds broke! Angela was about to take Bay's shopping to her and take her to the chiropodist. So I waited until she returned before we walked over to her. The fitting that secures the two ends of the cord had broken. But a couple of knots fixed the problem.</p>
        <p>12 July 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Another busy day. It started with a flying lesson from nine till twelve. It was quite chilly up on the Downs. I did some circuits in both directions, figures of eight and landing approaches. My positioning of the plane is still terrible. My engine starting equipment worked well, although the tube inside the fuel container came off!<br />
        After lunch we took Dad to Worthing hospital for his biopsy appointment. We thought it was just going to be from his ear, but Dr Atkinson had other ideas! She took samples from his head (two places) and his wrist, as well as his ear. She will refer him to the 'facial' unit, who do everything associated with skin operations on the head.<br />
        On the way back we made an appointment with the nurse at his local surgery to have stitches removed and an appointment with Dr Emmanuel to follow up the chest x-ray and blood test.<br />
        We then filled his pill box, changed his bed and cut his grass. Angela also tidied his front borders. The grass was really dry and yellow, except in the shady areas.<br />
        After dinner we watched the first night of the Proms.</p>
        <p>13 July 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After carrying two pairs of Bay's curtains to the newsagents for dry cleaning (and buying a paper), I had intended cutting the front grass. Well, at least just cutting off the tall stalks and daisies. But the mower would not keep running, even after many attempts. It would start, using the priming fuel and then stop. So I arranged to take it to the man in Henfield some time next week.<br />
        By then it was too hot to work outside, so I retrieved the tubing from the bottom of the fuel container and re-fitted it in a way that should prevent it from falling off. I also re-positioned the prop and straightened the front wheel.<br />
        After lunch (in the garden, in the shade and made of freshly baked Dutch bread) I updated the accounts. It was quite a complicated week, since we had moved a lot of money around and I had a bank statement. Luckily it all balanced! I also investigated the nature of Dad's contract with Virgin Media. It looks as though he just needs to give 30 days notice. By replacing it with BT Anytime and our spare TV using Freeview he should save about &#163;20 a month.<br />
        When the temperature had cooled a little I went over to Dad's and borrowed his mower (and collected the rhubarb and red currents that we forgot yesterday). I then cut the front grass before dinner.</p>
        <p>14 July 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following the usual Sunday morning trip to the newsagent I used Dad's mower to cut the grass in the back garden. Then, before lunch, I only had time to straighten the front wheel of my plane and set up thee garage for starting to make my field box. I found that I could put the plane fuselage on one of the racks in the roof of the garage. After lunch I cut the first piece using the circular saw (which seemed to burn as much as cut), marked out the details (several times), and cut the tongues. The idea is to cut one of the sides so as to test cutting the holes into which the tongues should fit. I also sharpened my tenor saw, which took some time. At this rate, it will take quite a while to complete the box!<br />
        We found that Paul and Krista were visiting Victoria and Brandon, so we were able to see Rowan and Austin in one call.<br />
        Alan Murray found a club member (Ron) who would lend me a flight simulator, so I e-mailed Ron to see what could be done.</p>
        <p>15 July 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>It was a ten o'clock start at the flying site this morning. However, after two flights of circuits and figure of eights, I found that the engine mount was loose. So we aborted the session.<br />
        This afternoon I tried to start up the laptop and found that the battery was flat! I then removed the engine from the plane and found one mount bolt missing and two others loose. Unfortunately Bunces did not have any bolts that small. I then did a little more work on my field box.<br />
        After dinner I checked the laptop battery, which was fully charged, and made sure that the login details for various accounts were recorded.</p>
        <p>16 July 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The day started with a shopping trip. I went to the model shop to get bolts for the engine mount. This was followed by getting some Saniflow Descaler and some sticky pads. The latter were really too small and I bought some larger pads from Bunces later in the day. I then called in to see Dad for a cup of coffee.<br />
        After lunch I walked down to Steyning for an eye test. I did not need any change to my prescription. The optician also took photos of my retinas. It seems that they are very healthy. The macula doesn't show any signs of age, the optic nerves are fine and the arteries and veins look in good condition (transparent and therefore no deposits). But she also took a photo of my eyelid, showing bacterial infection at the the base of the lashes. So I bought some 'wipes' to use morning and evening for a week and then three times a week.<br />
        The rest of the afternoon was spent refitting the engine mount and engine. One of the crab-nuts came loose! It took a piece of dowel with blue-tack on the end to get it back in place. Adjusting the throttle servo took some time.</p>
        <p>17 July 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>An exhausting day! I went over to Dad's before nine and Alan arrived a few minutes later, having already been to Goring. The next hour was spent removing the roof of Dad's shed. Actually Alan removed it and I just put the old felt into bags. Alan then went to Wickes to buy some sheet material and I cleared around the back of the shed. By lunchtime we had half the roof on and by five o'clock it was felted and new trimmings screwed on. It was a very hot day to be out in the garden. Angela arrived after lunch, compiled Dad's shopping list and went off to Tesco. Later in the afternoon, a British Gas technician came to service the boiler.</p>
        <p>We had cleared everything up and left by six o'clock. Alan was going to cut Dad's nails and then return to Goring before going home.</p>
        <p>18 July 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>I took off from the start today and at the end of the morning I landed the plane, albeit with a bit of a bump. I was at the flying site by 9 o'clock and so we got in four long flights, mainly with no one else in the air. So I did left and right circuits and quite a few (almost) touch and go's. It was very hot and quite tiring.<br />
        After a latish lunch I worked on my box.</p>
        <p>19 July 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning we collected Auntie Bay's curtains from the newsagents, took them to her and then went on to Dad's. He had an appointment with the Doctor and then with the nurse (Nurse Linda). The Doctor said that the chest x-ray was clear and the blood test was good. He is not anaemic. The nurse removed the stitches from the biopsy sites and dressed them. We then went to the bank in Lancing and set up a standing order to put money into his Santander account and moved some cash also. We bought some lunch (fish and chips for Dad and sandwiches for us) and took it back to Dad's.<br />
        We then went to the shoe shop in Findon to see if Angela could find something in their sale, but no luck.<br />
        Then I took the mower to the man in Henfield. He removed the tank and carburettor (2 bolts) and then removed the carburettor from the tank (4 bolts). The well into which the carburettor filter fits had dirt in it. He blew out the tank and the carburettor and all was well. Another &#163;10, but at least it was done and I now know what to do in the future if we have the same problem. As I was leaving so someone was collecting a similar mower that had the same problem.<br />
        I then worked on my box, discovering two mistakes that I had already made!</p>
        <p>20 July 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A relatively late start. We drove to the newsagents in Beeding (Angela needed to pay them for the cleaning of Autie Bay's curtains and buy a paper) and then set off for Victoria's. We left Beeding at twenty past nine and arrived in Binfield about ten past eleven. The weather was overcast, so the drive was reasonable and the traffic was light. From the Washington roundabout to Dorking (where we turned off the A24) we followed a very sprightly green MG TC.<br />
        We had a good day doing nothing except eating turkey burgers and salad (and then some sandwiches later) and playing with Austin. We arrived home just after nine o'clock.<br />
        I had phone SMC before we left and ordered 5l of Optifuel 10. However, when we got home there was a message from them saying that they could only order 60l and so could not take my order.</p>
        <p>21 July 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A day for catching up. I talked to Dad, entered his Mail rewards numbers and updated the accounts for the week. That seemed to take most of the morning. Although I probably spent too long reading yesterday's paper after returning from a walk to the newsagents.<br />
        This afternoon I booked our hotel room for Laura's wedding and spoke to someone about getting the battery replaced on the laptop. I need to take it in to PC World and get them to order one. Then I continued cutting pieces of my field box, making more mistakes!<br />
        We spoke to Paul, Krista and Rowan for a little while before Rowan's dinner.. We tried Google Hangouts after installing the application on the iPad, but we could not hear them. They could hear us, but the video was not very good, so we reverted to Skype.</p>
        <p>22 July 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Another three hours flying on the Downs. But not particularly successful! Even simple circuits did not work properly and many attempts at 'dead stick' resulted in two landings in the long grass.<br />
        Most of the afternoon was spent in the garage straightening the nose wheel and cutting out the handle part of my field box.<br />
        We then took Olive's china around to Bay's so that the auction house can see if it is worth selling. We discovered that her clean curtains had still not been hung, so we put them up for her.<br />
        The evening's TV was taken over by the birth of a boy to the Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
        <p>23 July 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Nothing planned today. Went to the model shop and bought some fuel and a glow plug. Then went on to PC World to see about getting the battery on the laptop replaced. They will let me know when it arrives. Also checked out MFD and broom handles in B&amp;Q..<br />
        After lunch it was haircut time. Although cooler today, it was still warm and humid, so the walk to Beeding was quite sweaty. Someone walked into the hairdresser's just before I got there. So I had a little wait (Sue had just left). My hair was cut just a little shorter than I had wanted, but it is summer. The rest of the afternoon was spent in the garage working on my box. Leaving the ends of the slots round seems to work.<br />
        The auctioneer has taken the china, but did not want the two copper items.</p>
        <p>24 July 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Not a day of great events. In fact the morning was spent doing or finishing some jobs. I replaced the kitchen cooker hood filter, which required a lot of degreasing,and then washed down the gutters and facias at the end of the bungalow. I can't reach the apex without a longer ladder or something on the end of a pole. After lunch we walked round to Bay's and fixed the cord on one of her blinds. They are generally well made, but they have a weak point where the cord is clamped.<br />
        After returning, and quite late in the day, I did a little more on my box.</p>
        <p>25 July 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>A morning spent at the flying site. I did quite a few approaches on minimum power, but still had trouble just doing the last corner of a right circuit. The cloud was low and we had drizzle at one point and needed to retreat to Alan's Landrover. Just after we gave up due to the chill, the weather started to improve and it became noticeably warmer. Some guys arrived for the glider contest. Gordon has a training simulator that I can borrow. He has run it on Windows 7 and it seems to have a variety of transmitter interfaces. He will contact Alan.<br />
        By searching for 'rc transmitter pinout' I was able to find that the buddy lead transmits the pulses that are sent to the receiver. The lead supplies 5V to the transmitter and uses only one pin to send the pulses. It should therefore be possible to convert the ppm signal to something that a PC would think is a USB joystick by using my Arduino. It might then be possible to use FMS.<br />
        Then more work on the box.</p>
        <p>26 July 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Most of this morning was spent at Dad's. He had an appointment with the nurse to check his biopsy sites. So I went over to ensure that he went. I took his mower back, helped him change his bed, sorted and filed his mail, filled his pill box and took his repeat prescription to the surgery. On the way I stopped to talk to the owner of a fine Morris traveller and on the way home I took his garden waste to the tip.<br />
        After lunch we went to collect a replacement battery for the laptop. Whilst at Lyons Farm we called into Halfords to look at bicycles. We bought a bike for Angela, along with a helmet and lock. We can collect it after lunch on Monday. We also looked in at the shoe shop. Angela bought some trainers and I bought some sandals (to wear without socks).<br />
        After dinner I updated the accounts since Alan M e-mailed to suggest that we meet at the flying site. In the morning.</p>
        <p>27 July 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After walking to the newsagents I had a fairly last minute trip to the flying site. Alan M suggested it since the weather forecast suggests that it will be a while before we Re able to fly again. Even today, the forecast was for rain by mid-morning, but it was warm and sunny all morning. My performance was a little better than it was on Thursday, but plenty more practice is needed. For some reason I could not get the engine to rev to full speed from the slave transmitter. So we turned up the adjustment and all was well. We then thought that there was a problem with the engine, but after it cut out in flight we found that the tank was still half full. A vigorous shake put the clunk back in it's right position and the engine then ran very well. We also added a small piece of wood to help hold the tank in place.<br />
        After a late lunch we cleared some things from the garage so as to make room for Angela's new bike.</p>
        <p>28 July 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>I straightened the nose wheel of my plane and this time improved the flat on the leg. I also replaced the piece of wood that we added to hold in the tank, adding a spot of superglue to stop it vibrating loose. Then I cut the slots in the final piece of my box. It all fits together, but needs adjusting before it is glued.<br />
        After lunch I replaced the inner tubes on my bike and cleaned/oiled it. Just a little more work and it will be ready to ride.<br />
        We had our weekly call with Victoria and Paul. Both Austin and Rowan were busy and looked happy.<br />
        I installed CRRCsim (Chalk River RC simulator) on the Mac, but the menu would not appear!</p>
        <p>29 July 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Mondays are good days when you are retired. Actually you realise on Sunday evening that you don't need to get up early in the morning to go to work!<br />
        I checked my installation of CRRCsim on the Mac, but it still would not work. So I tried installing it on Linux, but the repository did not contain the files! Finally I installed it on Windows 8, but I could not get it out of paused! The package does not seem to have been touched since 2009, so I think I will give up on it and try Gordon's simulator. I should be able to get it at the weekend (at one of the 'fun days').<br />
        I finished servicing my bike and just rode it up and down the close. It seems to work all right, but the shift on to one of the chain wheels may need adjusting.<br />
        Now that I have my first payslip for my main pension and the P45 from Invensys, I set up a spreadsheet to estimate my tax for this financial year. If IPS continue to take off tax at 20% (from the main pension), then I will pay about &#163;2,000 too much tax. I will need to see if IPS get my P45 and adjust the tax accordingly.<br />
        We collected Angela's new bike from Halfords after lunch. It was difficult to get it in the car, even with the front wheel removed. I then had difficulty finding out how to loosen the handlebars so as to turn them through 90 degrees, but having sorted that out I adjusted the seat height and Angela rode up and down the close.</p>
        <p>30 July 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning I had a message from Google that there had been some unusual activity on my account and suggesting that I change my password. I did that and Webmail worked, as did Google+, but Mac Mail, iPad Mail and my phone mail would not connect to the server. However, all worked later in the day with the new password.<br />
        At ten o'clock Angela took me to Shoreham where I caught the 700 to Brighton and then a bus from the Old Steine up the Lewis Road. I then walked around to Mark's house, where we had coffee and talked before going around the corner to a pub for lunch. It was poring with rain all morning and the relatively short walk resulted in me getting quite wet. However, we had a good chat before I walked down to the Old Steine and caught a 700 bus back to Shoreham. Angela met me at the recreation ground car park.<br />
        The remainder of the afternoon was spent fixing mail and helping Angela to complete her tax return.</p>
        <p>31 July 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A day gently working on my box. I filled the ends of the slots on the pieces that I had glued and then started cutting the two pieces that hold the battery and power panel. Angela went out to her table tennis club lunch and afterwards we cycled around to Auntie Bay's. The idea was to glue the back of her dining room chair, but she is having the seats re-upholstered and the back will be fixed as part of that.</p>
