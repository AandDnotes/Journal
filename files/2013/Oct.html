        <p>1 October 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Most of the day was spent painting the walls of the study. Meanwhile, Angela took the bus into Worthing and bought a jacket for Laura's wedding.<br />
        In the evening I went to Crawley for an IET lecture AT&amp;T he Hawth. It was given by the engineering manager of NATS (the national air traffic control service).</p>
        <p>2 October 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the walls in the study looked terrible! So I gave the cupboard doors a second coat and then went off to B&amp;Q and bought another pot of 'Warm Magnolia' paint. Most of the rest of the day was spent painting around the edges, painting the walls with the roller and cleaning everything up.<br />
        I then found the combination of Inkscape and Fritzing on Linux works, whereas that combination of applications did not work on the Mac.</p>
        <p>3 October 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>A day mainly spent shopping for Bay, Dad and us at Tesco and M&amp;S.<br />
        I spent the latter part of the afternoon re-hanging the door on the study.</p>
        <p>4 October 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A nine thirty start to Dick and Kate's. We had a good journey, arriving just before twelve thirty. This seemed longer than usual, even though there were no hold-ups.<br />
        After a late lunch Dick drove us, in their new CRV, to Stowe Gardens, where we walked around some of the paths. Stowe is a private school, but the grounds seem to be owned by the National Trust. The showery weather during the morning and over lunch turned into a fine, if breezy, afternoon.<br />
        After a late supper we looked at photos of grandchildren and Iceland and showed them our photos of Rowan, Austin and the Isle of Wight.</p>
        <p>5 October 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The day started with a cup of tea in bed! Even though that was at eight o'clock. Then, after quite a leisurely breakfast, Dick took us for a 50 mile drive to Calke Abbey, just south of Derby. Calke Abbey (built on the site of a priory) is a country manor house that was owned by an eccentric series of baronesses who collected various things, including many stuffed animals, but simply shut up the rooms when they could no longer maintain them. The NT have repaired the house, rather than restore it. Although they have restored the wallpaper in one of the rooms. There was also extensive grounds with a deer park and a large walled garden.<br />
        When we arrived we sat outside in the sunshine and had a bottle of wine. We also had our lunch outside and finished with a cup of tea in the car park.<br />
        On the way back they showed us where Karen and Stephen live and took us through Harlsden (at least Upper Harlsden) and past the Althorpe estate.<br />
        After a late supper we went straight to bed.</p>
        <p>6 October 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Another day that started with a cup of tea in bed! That was followed by a shower and a very lazy breakfast, until about 11 o'clock! Then we packed up our things and headed south. We aimed to stop for lunch at Hughenden Manor, the former home of Benjamin Disraeli. When we arrive we were surprised to find so many people there. It turned out that they were holding a World War II day (actually two days) and had 'dad's army on the north lawn and other displays on the south lawn. And the place was heaving. There were also a few period cars on display, including a 1948 MG TC in green with tan upholstery and in immaculate condition. We decided not to queue for a WWII lunch and had an ice cream in the walled garden. We then stopped at a service station of the M40 for a sandwich and a drink. We were home just before five.</p>
        <p>7 October 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Walked down to Beeding to take two suits to the newsagents for dry cleaning, while Angela went to Steyning.<br />
        We then drove over to Dad's to talk, drink coffee, change his bed and dust/vacuum his bedroom and dining room.<br />
        After lunch I started putting thing back in the study. I installed the power and telephone extension and got things back on the walls, but still need to move the desk and computer trolley.</p>
        <p>8 October 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The morning was spent moving the desk and computer trolley back into the study. This included relocating the phone and router back into the study.<br />
        After lunch I took my plane up to the flying site. There were quite a few people up there, but I managed to have four flights.</p>
        <p>9 October 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Since Angela it out tomorrow, we spent the morning doing the shopping for Bay, Dad and us. After lunch I took Bay's food round to here hole Angela went to table tennis and then started work on the chest of drawers that will form part of my modelling bench. When Angela got home she cut the back grass and I cut the front.</p>
        <p>10 October 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent preparing the chest of draws for painting. Then after lunch I gave it the first coat before Angela got back from her trip to Chichester. We then went to Dad's to cut his grass. On the way I went to B&amp;Q and the tip, while Angela went to Dunn Elm Mill to look for a throw for the old sofa.</p>
        <p>11 October 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A second coat of paint was applied to the chest of draws this morning. While Angela took Bay to her appointment, I re-designed the bench. Now I just need to cut the MDF and try to build the bench. I also watched the Marvel programme on 4oD.<br />
        During the afternoon I updated the version of IOS on the iPad, played with the simulator and ordered an HDMI to VGA converter for the Pi and a small mouse for the laptop.<br />
        After dinner I opened a savings account with Aldermore and applied for one with the AA. I also replied to Channel 4 with regard to the problem I had trying to watch a programme.</p>
        <p>12 October 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The day started with a queue outside the health centre to get a flu jab! We then went on to the newsagents in Beeding to pick up the (clean) suits and buy a paper.<br />
        I eventually managed to cut the pieces of MDF for the modelling bench. The saw attachment for my drill was just not up to the job and I had to finish it using a hand saw.<br />
        In the evening we took Bay to the Music Society fund raising event. It was an entertaining evening.</p>
        <p>13 October 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent screwing together the modelling bench, although I discovered that he paint not he chest of draws scratches easily. So I touched up the paint and also updated Linux Mint on the laptop. However, I seem to have lost the wireless network configuration! This may have happened when a power cut broke the connection.<br />
        During the late afternoon we also had our usual chat with firstly Victoria/Austin and then Paul/Rowan.<br />
        I got advice via the Mint forum as to how to add Fritzing to the menu.</p>
        <p>14 October 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>As Angela went down to help with the lunch club, so I joined her, but went on to Bunces to buy some adhesive to stick cork tiles to the top of my modelling bench. I then spent the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon fixing the cork to the bench.<br />
        During this, I had a call from PDH to say that the Panda is ready. I chose GU63 WHD from three alternatives (...F and ...G) and they took details for a temporary seven-day insurance cover. I can collect the car tomorrow at 3pm. So when I had finished the bench I cleared out the Modus and collected together the registration document, MoT and keys.<br />
        I also continued trying to get the laptop to connect to the wireless router, without success.</p>
        <p>15 October 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent trying to create a recovery disk for Windows 8 and the installation of Mint 15. Eventually I managed to get the wireless network working on both Windows 8 and Linux Mint 14. I still need to sort out recovery disks and then the partitions so that I can install Mint 15 with a separate home partition.<br />
        This afternoon I collected our new car. PDH had obviously ordered the split rear seat, rather than the height-adjustable drivers seat. So they gave us the driver's seat, split rear seat and spare wheel for the cost of one. It had done 25 miles. When I got home I sent off the registration document slip to the DVLA.<br />
        I took the Panda to Falmer for an IET talk by National Grid on the power distribution network.</p>
        <p>16 October 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Angela had her first drive of the new Panda this morning. She drove, in the rain, over the Bostal to visit Dad. I trimmed his hair and filled his pill box while Angela compiled his shopping list. We then went to Lyons Farm to get writable DVDs, a light for over the modelling bench and mats for the car. Before we went out I phoned to change the insurance to the new car.<br />
        After lunch I downloaded the insurance certificate, downloaded and installed virus software on Windows 8 (in place of Norton) and created a set of recovery disks. I also fitted the light above the modelling bench.</p>
        <p>17 October 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>A. relatively early start, we left home at 8:30, to go to Holmbush for the weekly shop. We then called in on Dad to give him his groceries. We needed to be early because I had an appointment with the hygienist. Whilst I was there, Angela delivered groceries to Bay.<br />
        After a latish lunch I checked the tyre pressures on the Panda while Angela took her WI accounts books to the accountant. We then picked the larger apples from the cooker and eater trees. I then wrapped the sound apples in newspaper and packed them in boxes.</p>
        <p>18 October 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent (playing) working on adding a custom part to Fritzing. I managed to get the schematic image and the connections defined (for the signal level converter), but I am having trouble with the pictures of the board in the breadboard image and the part's icon.<br />
        I did, however, do a few other little things. I updated the accounts, straightened the nose wheel on my model and fixed the aerial and I tidied the data on our share holdings. Most of this was done sitting down in the study, which is not really a good thing to do.</p>
        <p>19 October 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A relatively early start for Laura's wedding day. We left Dad's at twenty past ten, thinking this would give us plenty of time. We probably spent too long having our lunch at the service station on the M25 , since we met heavy traffic in Leighton Buzzard and arrived after the wedding had been due to start. Luckily, Alan and Laura were delayed as well! We dropped Dad at the church, leaving him with Michelle (who was one of the bridesmaids) while we went to the multi-storey car park.<br />
        After the service we all set off to the reception at Horwood House Hotel, some ten miles away. We had a good meal before the room was rearranged for the disco and for Richard's band. We finally had enough of the noise and retreated to the bar outside, eventually going to our rooms shortly after midnight.</p>
        <p>20 October 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>There was a long queue for cooked food at breakfast.and we finally finished at ten o'clock and checked out by eleven. We returned through Leighton Buzzard and on to Tilsworth and Yellow Farm. We met up again with members of the family and had lunch before leaving for home at about three twenty. Unfortunately it was raining and got worse wile we were on the M1 and M25. The rain was heavy and there was a lot of spray! The weather improved by the time that we turned off the M25 and we arrived at Dad's at six o'clock.</p>
        <p>21 October 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A lot of the day was spent working out what I need for the initial investigation into building my own radio control gear. Unfortunately, the micro controller that I had intended using does not now seem to be available, even though it is still on the Arduino list. However, I decided to use a smaller, simpler module (one with no built-USB port), but one that uses the same voltage as the RF module. Therefore no level converters will be needed.<br />
        I also painted the rust spots on the MG and started thinking about Dad's 90th birthday party.</p>
        <p>22 October 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Most of the day was spent in the study trying to find the pieces that could be used to connect the Arduino Pro Mini and the AWA24S (and the antennae). I also drew SVG images for the AWA24S to be used in Fritzing.<br />
        I also picked up a free child's cot via GreenCycle. Then I spoke to Beryl, Martin and Anthony about Dad's birthday.</p>
        <p>23 October 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>A slight sore throat last night materialised into a sore through and headache this morning. So Angela did the supermarket shopping on her own and I went back to bed. Then I did a few small jobs and worked on my RC design.<br />
        In the evening I left a message on Uncle Mick's answer phone.</p>
        <p>24 October 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>A bad night for sleep. I woke at three and could not get back to sleep until about five thirty. My virus seems to have moved to my nose!<br />
        After breakfast I went back to bed. Angela has gone to a WI event in Worthing. I did manage to go to sleep, but Aunt Joan phoned at 10:15 to say that they would not be able to get to Dad's birthday party. I was in the middle of an odd dream! So I got up and had a shower. It is a fine day; bright and calm. It would be good for flying, but I don't think that I could manage it.<br />
        The rest of the day was then spent trying to work out a good power supply strategy for my RC design. It is amazing how time can pass when you seem to be going around in circles!</p>
        <p>25 October 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I had quite a good night's sleep and my cold seemed a little less severe. However, I did not feel up to going into Worthing and so Angela went on her own, on the bus.<br />
        So I mailed Alan Murray to ask him about servo voltages supplied by the BEC that is part of an ESC and continued work on my RC design. By the end of the day I had built a voltage regulator module in Fritzing and added it to my schematic and breadboard views.<br />
        Dad called when he could not open the door of his washing machine. I suggested that he put it on a short spin and try again. Luckily this worked.<br />
        During the afternoon Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and then on to the garden centre.</p>
        <p>26 October 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Following a walk to the newsagents in Beeding, this was another morning spent at one computer or another, working on my RC design and doing the accounts. Although I did also test that the old PC power supply would start if I shorted the on/off signal. Angela spent her time in the garden, digging up the runner bean plants and some foxgloves for Dad. After lunch we went over to Dad's to sort out his pills, change his bed and vacuum around a little. Angela also planted the foxgloves in the front and I filed various bill/statements. We then went to Lyons Farm to see if we could find any shoes; but no luck.<br />
        My cold is still heavy and seems to be turning into the usual cough!</p>
        <p>27 October 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Another walk to the newsagents in Beeding and then, after a cup of coffee, I went over to Dad's to help him tidy up things in the garden in preparation for the storm due tonight. After lunch we did the same in our garden. The forecasters are threatening 80mph winds tomorrow! I also brought back some windfall apples from Dad's. He kept some, saying that he would cook them. This seems unlikely, but we cooked some and Angela made two apple pies. We will take a couple of slices to him when we eat them.</p>
        <p>28 October 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>After a very stormy night we looked out with some trepidation. But all was well, and neither Dad nor Bay had any problems either. We went for a walk after lunch and only found a few branches, mainly those covered in ivy, in the road. The rest of the day was spent finalising the parts list for each supplier for my RC design. I also spent some time looking at implementing an oscilloscope on the laptop. It seems that I would need to build some buffers fort he probes connected to the microphone input. However, it will only work if the microphone input will record stereo sound. Finding details of the sound card, however, seems to be a problem.<br />
        We arranged for the money in a maturing Santander bond to be paid into Angela's newly opened 1-2-3 account.<br />
        I also texted Mark and agreed that we should try to meet next week. I will also try to get Simon along.</p>
        <p>29 October 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>This morning we caught the Compass bus into Worthing. I went to Maplins and bought parts for my power supply unit (using an old PSU from a PC) and case for my Raspberry Pi. After a cup of coffee in Waitrose, I also bought a pair of shoes as replacements for my Alabama bargains. They certainly cost a lot more.<br />
        We caught the 12:40 bus home and so had a late lunch. Angela then went in the garden to put the pots back in place. I marked out the holes on the power box and then went into the garden to cut down some pieces of bush. I also found a micro USB plug on the Digi-Key site for the power lead to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
        <p>30 October 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>I completed my power distribution box and wired it up to the PSU. I can now turn on the PSU and have 5V and 3.3V available.<br />
        Dad called late in the afternoon to say that his TV was not working! Angela was just returning from table tennis and so we had a cup of tea and then drove over the Downs. It turned out that Dad had inadvertently switched his TV to another input source. Both the TV/DTV button and the Source button are just above the channel number buttons (and below the on/off button) and so are easily pressed by mistake. We took the opportunity to compile Dad's shopping list.<br />
        I looked, unsuccessfully, at removing the toilet seat. The 'nut' on the loose side turns, but does not move up or down the bolt, and I can't move the nut on the other side, mainly due to restricted access.</p>
        <p>31 October 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Thursday, as usual, is shopping day. So this morning we set off to Holmbush, to M&amp;S and to Tesco. We started by ordering a birthday cake for Dad. Then shopped and delivered some to Dad on the way home. After lunch Angela took Bay's shopping to her and I made up my leads for use with the power distribution box.<br />
        We had and early dinner and then walked to the Beeding Village hall to attend the first part of the parish council meeting. Actually, the presentation by Southern Gas Networks took place before the meeting started. SGN are starting next week to replace the gas mains in the area. It will take them about three months to cover, The Ridings, Maudlin Parkway, Maudlin Lane, Clays Hill (towards Steyning), The Bostal and some other roads. Hopefully it will not affect us other than some holes in the road. Generally they will push plastic pipe through the old steel pipes.</p>
