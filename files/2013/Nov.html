        <p>1 November 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Finally I found out how to remove the toilet seat. So I took it apart, cleaned it and put it back together. I spent most of the rest of the day building a platform to go over Dad's DVD player.</p>
        <p>2 November 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After a walk to the newsagents the whole day seemed to be spent on things financial. Weekly accounts, monthly summary, monthly analysis, moving direct debits from one account to another. In between I managed to tidy up the ends of Dad's TV shelf and give them a couple of coats of varnish. Hopefully I can take it to him tomorrow afternoon.<br />
        Then I updated OS X to the latest version. I also updated iPhoto, but iMovie would not update since the hardware would not support it.</p>
        <p>3 November 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>So I finally bit the bullet and ordered my RC components from DigiKey and Proto-PIC. I also installed gparted so as to format the SD card for the Raspberry Pi. I should also be able to use gparted to create a separate home partition so that I can update the OS without destroying all my files.<br />
        After lunch we went to Dad's. I invited his neighbours to his party, cut his grass and installed his DVD player under the TV shelf that I had made. The player worked with commercial DVDs, but would not get past the menu on his cine film DVDs. Angela also helped him change his bed.</p>
        <p>4 November 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Simon Windust and his wife came over this morning. Mark texted to say that his neck was too sore to drive. After a chat, we went to the Castle Inn for lunch.<br />
        I had found on huge laptop that the Linux system would not recognise the SD card reader. However, Win 8 would. I managed to find the make and model of the reader, download a driver for Linux and install it. The SD card reader was then recognised Nd I was able to write to it. I downloaded the NOOB files and loaded them to the SD card. I also prepared the config file to handle the HDMI to VGA adapter.<br />
        I also received messages from DigiKey and Proto-PIC to say that my orders had been dispatched. I delayed the Proto-PIC order until Wednesday so that we can go to Brighton tomorrow. The DigiKey order is coming from the US and so will take a while.</p>
        <p>5 November 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The day was spent basically doing two things, getting the Raspberry Pi working and going to Brighton to buy theatre tickets.<br />
        Having got the NOOB interface working just before lunch, I was able, later in the afternoon to get the Rasperian OS to start up and use the monitor, keyboard and mouse. Now I need to work out how to get a remote desktop to work from the laptop.<br />
        Our trip to Brighton on the bus resulted in us buying four tickets to see 'Priscilla, queen of the desert' at the Theatre Royal on January 2nd.</p>
        <p>6 November 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>More or less the whole day was spent playing with computers! During the morning I managed to get the Raspberry Pi talking to the laptop via a direct Ethernet connection. I could open a remote terminal and open application windows. However, the remote desktop did not work very well. So I installed a VCN server on the Raspberry Pi and a client on Mint. So I can now boot up the Pi and then connect via VCN and don't need a dedicated monitor, keyboard and mouse.<br />
        I then plugged the USB wireless adapter into the Ubuntu system! and it worked. I had done some research and found that the chip set was now supported by Ubuntu. So I was able to connect it to the router wirelessly and do an update.</p>
        <p>7 November 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Grocery shopping day again. A short visit to Dad to get his shopping list was followed by a visit to Sainsbury's at Hove and M&amp;S at Holmbush. After a late lunch, I tidied my RC components, checked the Ubuntu PC and played with my RPi. I found that I could open a remove desktop when the RPi was connected to the router. This way, the RPi has access to the internet. However, I currently need to guess the IP address that the DHCP server has allocated to the RPi.<br />
        After dinner I drove to Crawley to attend an IET talk on 'managed motorways'.</p>
        <p>8 November 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>After a morning of checking bank accounts, flying on the simulator and trying to sort out Dad''s 'cine' DVD's we had a rather unexpected afternoon. It all started with the decision to wash the car. I washed the bottom quarter and the wheels. Then, when taking a new, full bucket of water from the sink, the bucket broke and two gallons of water was on the kitchen floor! But that was only the start of it. I had to pull out the washing machine and the dish washer. In the corner next tot he dish washer we found some long-term damp, with a brown sludge on the bare floorboards. Clearly the dish washer wasted has been leaking for some time. So we cleaned up and left the floor uncovered to help it dry.<br />
        Then Angela had to cook a dessert and cakes for tomorrow's church fair and I cooked our dessert. Then it was quite late before cooked supper.</p>
        <p>9 November 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After the drama of yesterday, today was a little calmer. Today was the Methodist Church Christmas Bazaar and Angela was helping to prepare lunches. I was asked to help by selling tickets for the ploughman's and puddings. Unfortunately it rained heavily for most of the morning and so attendance was low. Luckily I had bought a paper in Steyning!<br />
        We bought an interesting jigsaw puzzle at the bazaar, but really did little else.</p>
        <p>10 November 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A quieter day today. A walk to the newsagents in Beeding was followed by a play with the RPi to establish exactly how I can get a remote connection when the Pi is wired to the router. Then I started investigating how to build a new DVD or two from Dad's cine films (put onto DVD by Laura some years ago, but in random order). Before dinner we also Facetimed/Skyped Austin/Rowan.</p>
        <p>11 November 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>This morning I took Dad to the bank to get the cash he wants to give 'the children' and transfer some money to his savings account. I also changed his bed before going into Worthing to get some 'bits' from Maplins and the model shop. Meanwhile, Angela was helping at the lunch club.<br />
        After lunch I made up the USB power lead for the RPi, using a new, fine tip soldering iron. I also continued experimenting with Dad's cine film conversion to DVD.<br />
        And then, in the evening, after two calls about my advert for the PC, the e-mail enquirer came and bought it.</p>
        <p>12 November 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Well, today was interesting. It was the Mini Big Bang event at the Northbrook College Shoreham Airport site. Julian Bond and I manned the Lego Challenge stall. We had about ten school parties (all 12/13 years old) building 'gadgets of the future'. It was tiring, but an interesting day, with lots of other company sponsored stalls. Joe and Earl were there with the Invensys stand.<br />
        I only had a bacon roll just after 10 o'clock, so I had a light lunch when I got home at four. Angela returned from her committee meeting while I was eating it. Then I cleared away the garage vacuum cleaner and pushed the washing machine back into place.</p>
        <p>13 November 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>We started with a trip to Swains, the farm shop at Henfield, to buy vegetables out of which to make soup for Dad's birthday party on Saturday. That seemed to take most of the morning!<br />
        After lunch Angela went to her table tennis club and I took my plane up to the flying field. Half of the club seemed to be there! It was a little late when I arrived, but the sun was still shining and the wind was only light. However, quite a few people were packing up and going home. I talked to Alan Murray and a few others for a while and then had one flight. It was a little bit of a challenge, since I had to circuit in the less usual direction. However, I made a good landing (in spite of the sheep that had strayed on to the strip), but the plane tipped forward before it came to rest. I discovered that the nose wheel had come loose again and twisted, causing the tipping. It was also very cold, so I decided to pack up and come home. It looks as though I will need to replace the whole nose wheel assembly.<br />
        Later I did a little more work on Dad's cine DVD.</p>
        <p>14 November 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day again! However, when we arrived at Dad's it was clear that he was not feeling well. He said he was just feeling a bit giddy and would soon be ok. So we compiled his shopping list and went off to Saisbury's at Lyons Farm. When we got back, he was still unwell and was shivering as well. I stayed with him while Angela went off to Bay's to take her to the nurse. I phoned his surgery and asked for a doctor to call back. By the time he did, Dad had slept a little and was feeling better. He ate his lunch and looked back to normal by the time that Angela came to collect me.<br />
        The afternoon was then spent making vegetable soup for Saturday</p>
        <p>15 November 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning we bought food and drink for Dad's birthday party. We left as much as we could at his house and this afternoon Angela made a trifle.</p>
        <p>16 November 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The day of Dad's.90th birthday party started relatively early, preparing the final things to take and loading them into the car. We arrived at about 11 o'clock, with Alan and Chris arriving at about midday. We had a good turn-out and we think that Dad enjoyed the day.<br />
        The children returned with us to have dinner, before Paul and Krista went home.</p>
        <p>17 November 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A day to recover and regroup after Dad's birthday party. After lunch we went over to Dad''s to tidy up.</p>
        <p>18 November 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today was spent lifting parts of the kitchen floor between the dish washer and the cooker. I firstly removed the cooker, having struggled in the past to disconnect the gas supply,and then lifted the hardboard under the dishwasher, the cooker and under the cupboard in between. I think we have decided to have a complete new kitchen!!!<br />
        I also placed an ad for my car!</p>
        <p>19 November 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>I'm not sure where the morning went to. A bit of work on Dad's cine DVD, a little practice on the flight simulator and a start on setting up the Uno to test out the Micros.<br />
        After lunch we went to explore the Range warehouse and then called in on Dad to wish him a Happy Birthday (and drink his tea).<br />
        Then after another dinner cooked in huge microwave I went to Falmer for an IET talk on the Bluebell railway.</p>
        <p>20 November 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Before showering, I took up more of the kitchen floor! I also started writing some test sketches for the Arduino.<br />
        This afternoon I had been invited to the Santander celebration event at Brighton. However, when I tried to start the MG it would not. The battery seems to be flat again! So Angela took me to Shoreham to ketch the 700 bus before she went to table tennis and took Bay to the doctors. I then caught the number 25 up to Moulscombe. I was only five minutes late, but everyone was still chatting and drinking. I then did the reverse process and Angela collected me from near the Swiss Cottage.<br />
        Since the cooker is still not back in place we decided to walk down to Steyning to try the new restaurant. But when we got there they were closed! So we went into the Chequers for a meal.</p>
        <p>21 November 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Weekly shopping day again! Dad was still on his way to the corner shop when we arrived. We compiled his shopping list and set off to Lyons Farm and then on to Holmebush. It was two o'clock before we got home.<br />
        This afternoon I reconnected the cooker, even though it is still pulled out and then borrowed a battery charger from Terry and started charging the MG's battery.<br />
        I also started thinking about soldering the headers on the USB interface module.</p>
        <p>22 November 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>After charging the MG's battery it started easily, so I took it for a short drive, just to warm the oil. I then soldered the headers on to the USBInterface board and the Pro Mini. Unfortunately, although the power reached the micro controller, there was no green LED and a sketch would not upload. I requested support from Proto-Pic and posted a question on the Aduino forum. In between, I continued generating parts of Dad's cine film DVD..</p>
        <p>23 November 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>After a walk to the newsagents in Beeding, I did the weekly accounts (which took quite a time) and then soldered breakout pins on one of my Pro Mini Arduinos. This was following a reply from Proto-Pic, suggesting that I wired the signals directly to the Arduino pins. But still no joy. I mailed back to Proto-Pic, who replied, suggesting that I could load a boot loader through another Arduino.<br />
        After lunch Angela washed the car while I cut the front grass and the top lawn at the rear. It was too wet really.</p>
        <p>24 November 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>On Sunday afternoon we went to a Music Society concert at the Steyning Centre. The concerts are usually on Saturday evenings, but a 3pm start worked quite well. Bay was due to join us, but she has a cold. The concert was given by a recorder quintet. It was quite interesting and entertaining, although I can't confess to be a fan of the recorder, particularly the higher pitched ones. They played music from the renaissance to the modern day.<br />
        I started setting up a circuit on a breadboard to try to burn a bootloader to my Arduino Pro Mini, having decided that the most likely cause of the problem was that SparkFun had failed to do so.</p>
        <p>25 November 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>We started by going to Dad's, to fill his pill box and change his bed. While I did that, Angela caught the local bus into Worthing.<br />
        When I got home I retrieved the old fire guard from the shed at the bottom of the garden and cleaned it up for use in the sitting room.<br />
        Then I completed the circuit to allow my Arduino Uno to act as an ISP and successfully burnt the bootloader on to the Pro Mini. I had to do the same for the other Pro Mini also. Following that, I could connect the laptop to the controller via the FDTI module, upload a sketch and communicate with it via the Serial Monitor. I was lucky with the second Pro Mini. I initially soldered the six-pin female header (for the FDTI board) on the wrong side. I then had to unsolder it and put it on the right side. I then soldered on the two strips of mail pins, since I needed to use some of these to burn the bootloader. In spite of some damage to the board, the burning worked, as did uploading a sketch via the FDTI board.</p>
        <p>26 November 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>I pulled out the fridge to check that is was dry underneath. Then I spent time testing one of the Pro Minis. But then the second controller would not upload a sketch!<br />
        In the early evening I went to Brighton for the FLL pre-meeting.</p>
        <p>27 November 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Most of the day spent either trying to find a way of making my Arduino Pro Mini work with the FDTI board or reading details of the FIRST Lego League due to take place tomorrow. I tried soldering a separate connection between the FDTI header and another pin, but still no joy.</p>
        <p>28 November 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>An early start to Brighton. I allowed an hour, but it only took 25 minutes! The day was very enjoyable and the school children were very engaged and involved. I arrived home at about 4:15.</p>
        <p>29 November 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>I don't seem to have done much today at all. In the morning I wrote an e-mail to Dick Morris, only to find that his e-mail address did not work! Then I established that my damaged Pro Mini will work with the FDTI board if I patch the pins to the main pins on the Pro Mini.<br />
        After lunch and a read of the DAG papers we walked up Sopers Lane to the Bostal and then down the side of the Horseshoe. It must have taken just over an hour.</p>
        <p>30 November 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A walk to the newsagents in Beeding and then a trip to Dad's via Argos (to buy a mobile tray for Bay), Curry's to look at radios and B&amp;Q to buy a Christmas tree. At Dad's we tested his washing machine. It seemed to work once the spin speed was moved off zero!<br />
        After lunch we took the tray to Bay's. She had not dressed or eaten anything, saying that she could not stay awake. Angela walked down to Bunces to get her some replacement bulbs and I fitted one in her shower room. The tray looks very robust and should be what she wants.</p>
