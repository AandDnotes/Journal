        <p>1 September 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>A lot of the morning was taken with walking down to the newsagents in Beeding and then on to Clays Field so that Rowan could feed the ducks. She would really have liked to dip her feet in the water.<br />
        In the afternoon, while the others went down to the playground at Fletchers Croft, I cut the replacement pieces for the garage window sill. They now need planing to shape and fitting.</p>
        <p>2 September 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Angela and I went with Paul, Krista and Rowan to Swains farm shop in Henfield so that Rowan could see the animals.<br />
        After an early lunch I took Dad to St Richards hospital in Chichester for his pre-op.</p>
        <p>3 September 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>After walking to Steyning, pushing Rowan in her buggy, to get some roles for lunch we all set off for a day out. Firstly we went to the Green House charity shop in Lancing and then took the scenic (coastal) route to Littlehampton. We firstly went to the main town beach, but it was shingle, so we went to the west beach. It was also shingle! When the tide went out there was, however, some sand. Nevertheless, Rowan enjoyed her time on the beach. We had our picnic lunch on the beach and after Rowan paddled in the sea we went on to Dad's for a cup of tea.<br />
        We then all walked to the Castle in Bramber for dinner.</p>
        <p>4 September 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Today things have started getting back to normal (if there is such a thing) following our wonderful visit by Rowan. We started fairly early (well, eight thirty-ish) by going to B&amp;Q. Paul drove me down to Shoreham because I stood more chance of getting the pieces of MDF that I need for my modelling bench in his car. Even then, it was a tight fit, with me squeezed into the front seat with my legs at an angle and my knees pressed against the door.<br />
        When we got home, they packed up the car and set off home. The rest of the day was then spent catching up (accounts and sorting out energy contracts), having a shower and doing more work on the garage window repair while Angela went to her table tennis club.</p>
        <p>5 September 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>This morning's flying session was quite a milestone. I flew solo after the first flight! We practiced the manoeuvres required for the solo test and I finished on a near perfect 'dead stick' landing. By that time there were a dozen people at the site, including someone with a jet. It sounded like the real thing, but just as we were leaving his engine cut out as he was doing a low pass over the strip and the plane disappeared into the next field.<br />
        Meanwhile Angela was doing the shopping for everyone<br />
        After lunch I finished making the new part for the garage window sill and Angela took Bay to the chiropodist. After dinner I primed it in the hope that I can glue it in place tomorrow. I also replied to Manolis, approving the disbursement requests.</p>
        <p>6 September 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>We were expecting Victoria and Brandon (plus Austin of course) to arrive at about 8pm. However, it was at that time that we received a message saying that they were just leaving. They arrived at about 9:30 and so it was quite late before e all got to bed. Austin was up until about eleven, but then slept well in the travel cot.<br />
        Earlier in the afternoon I had dropped Angela and Bay at the Chatsworth Hotel to meet Bay's cousin Freda (actually Alfreda it seems). I then went on to Dad's to help him change his bed and to fill his tablet box. We chatted until Angela called to be collected. From the Chatsworth we went to Holmbush so that Angela could shop for the lunch club while By and I had a quick look around Marks.<br />
        I spent most of the morning removing Netherlands washers from behind the engine mount on my plane, in the hope that it would give more down thrush. This required removing the engine! I also realigned the nose wheel.<br />
        I also managed to reply to Steve Maycock on the proposed changes to the Springboard Grants programme.</p>
        <p>7 September 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>We had a relatively late start; no one seemed to want to stir. Eventually we rose, had breakfast and while Angela and the others went to Steyning I put the spare TV in the car and glued my new piece of window sill in place. Slightly later than planned we all went off to Dad's to remove his cake TV box and replace his set. All seems to be working well and I took his old CRT set to the tip.<br />
        After lunch we all went to Clays Field so that Austin could feed the ducks (who were not very interested) before they went on to Bay's and we came home. Angela prepared a goulash for dinner and I filled the gaps in the repaired window sill.<br />
        Dinner was fairly frantic, as usual when Austin is here. However, after dark, as Austin was being readied for bed, we saw a badger in the garden. It was only illuminated by the outside lights, but I tried to take its photo on my phone.</p>
        <p>8 September 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Everyone, except me, was up fairly early this morning. After breakfast we (Victoria, Brandon, Rowan and I) walked to the newsagents by Beeding bridge to buy a paper while Angela started preparing lunch. The idea was that we wold have an early lunch so that they could get home reasonably early. Whereas meal times with Rowan are enjoyable, those with Austin are hectic!<br />
        I managed to sand down the filler on the repaired window sill before the heavy, rain came. At least V &amp; B seemed to miss this rain on their way home. Part of the afternoon was then spent putting together a couple of video clips to make a little video of their visits to show Dad and Bay. We also had a video chat with P &amp; K (and Rowan of course) before Angela got back to preparing her apple crumbles for the lunch club tomorrow.<br />
        After tea I picked up thoughts of my RC design. Digikey charge &#163;12 postage on orders under &#163;50 and my two transceivers only come to &#163;35. I spent some time trying to find other items that they could supply. Unfortunately they do not seem to sell the Arduino Micro (I want two) and I could not find any voltage regulators that would be suitable. However, I did find that an old PC PSU that I have will supply both 3.3v and 5v. So I should be able to make use of that.<br />
        I then had a little practice on the flight simulator.</p>
        <p>9 September 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Not what you would call a productive day! After taking Angela, with her lunch club ingredients, down to the church I had a shower and started to think about decorating the study. Or rather, what needed to be done in order to start decorating the study. I folded the camping cot and put it in the wardrobe so as to make more space in the spare bedroom and cleared away my Arduino kit. In between I contacted CPP about losing the first part of their online registration information.<br />
        Later I cleaned up the contents of the old Linux PC, creating an Admin user. I then moved it on to the desk, took its photo and posted an advertisement on the Friday-Ad web site. Hopefully I can sell it for enough to buy the extra bits I need for the Raspberry Pi. I also posted my grainy photo of a badger in our garden at night.<br />
        I had planned to meet Alan at the flying site this afternoon, but torrential rain caused us to cancel the session.</p>
        <p>10 September 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Most of the day was spent taking Dad to St Richards in Chichester. He went into the Day Surgery Unit to have a piece of scalp and left ear removed and needs to stop in over night.</p>
        <p>11 September 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Since I did not need to collect Dad from St Richards until after lunch I spent the morning clearing out the gutters!<br />
        I then went to Chichester and found Dad with a dressing on his head that looked more like a turban. He seemed fine and I sat with him for a while. Of course, when Alan phoned him he was having a dizzy spell and felt bad. However he soon recovered.</p>
        <p>12 September 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>The morning was spent at the flying site. We needed to do quite a lot of sheep herding! However, I practiced the manoeuvres for the solo test, along with a number of 'dead stick' situations from a number of locations. Alan says that I am now ready for my solo test and so will e-mail Barry.<br />
        After lunch we went to Tesco and Marks to do the weekly shop. I bought a jacket also.</p>
        <p>13 September 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>This morning I took Dad to see the nurse to have his dressing looked at. He did not want to walk down the road in his 'turban', so we had to drive. But there were no parking places! The surgery had brought forward his appointment due to a nurse being sick, but they were running late. Then nurse Linda turned out to be somewhat bumbling. However, I now need to apply his antibiotic cream twice a day.<br />
        Otherwise I started clearing the study. This meant taking the desk apart and reassembling it in the dining room, which also has the computer trolley and the old Linux PC on the table.</p>
        <p>14 September 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Today was the start of a twice daily visit to Dad's to apply anti-biotic cream to his ear.<br />
        Filled and primed parts of the repaired window sills.<br />
        In the evening we went to the music society concert at the Steyning Centre. It was a pianist who played both classical and 'modern' music. We took Auntie Bay.</p>
        <p>15 September 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>In addition to my two visits to Dad I under coated the windows.</p>
        <p>16 September 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Two visits to Dad's again, plus top-coated the windows. Also sanded the garage doors and under-coated the bottom portions.</p>
        <p>17 September 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>Most of the morning was spent at Dad's. he needed to go to the nurse to have the dressing on his head replaced. After lunch I took down the shelves on the wall of the study (as well as the curtains and lampshade) so that it is ready for decorating. Then another trip to Dad's.</p>
        <p>18 September 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Again a lot of the morning was spent at Dad's, this time vacuuming! He managed to put the cream on his ear himself and so will do it from now on.<br />
        After lunch I went to the flying field for my solo test. It was a bit windy and my flying was terrible, but Barry passed me! During my landing I bounced the plane and it hit its nose on the ground, cracking part of the engine compartment. Luckily I had put the superglue in my box and fixed it so as to complete the second part of the test. I fixed it more permanently when I got home.<br />
        I managed to replace the rotten piece of shiplap on the shed.</p>
        <p>19 September 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>We made a relatively early start to the weekly shop and were at Dad's by 11 o'clock.<br />
        This afternoon I went to George Turnbull''s house to meet with him and Hamish to talk about the 'finger buffet' event.</p>
        <p>20 September 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>We started by taking Connie back to Paul's. we had lunch with Krista and Rowan before going for a walk by the river and calling in at the park. Rowan was reluctant to leave the slide! We then went on to Victoria's and walked to the nursery to collect Austin. We called in to another park on the way home. Austin was reluctant to leave the slide! Then there was a lot of playing with cars and a cereal box, both before and after dinner.</p>
        <p>21 September 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Pancakes for breakfast (American style, with maple syrup) and then a walk to the shops for some bread. Austin walked quite a way and we called in the charity shop and bought some toys. Following an early lunch (BLTs) we went off to Wokingham, where Victoria was playing with her band. They were quite good, but there are a lot of charity shops in Wokingham (Angela is looking for a dress for Laura's wedding)! We left at about three thirty, but it took us two hours to get home, due to not finding the roads we wanted and the cycle race going through Guildford.</p>
        <p>22 September 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following a walk to the newsagents I spent most of the day painting the garage doors (and frame). During the afternoon Angela cut the back grass with the new mower. I then cooked the dinner while Angela went around to Bay's to help her sort out the setting of her freezer.</p>
        <p>23 September 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A day mainly spent catching up with small things; accounts, downloading photos, updating iPad to latest OS. Then I washed the MG, since I was planning to take it out in the evening. Angela was out with Bay at Marks to use her 20% off vouchers. I went to the Sussex IET committee meeting at the Hawth. I had been invited by Hamish to attend, due to my help with the 'finger buffet' event. Earlier in the day I had spoken to Ann Brunsden about using the Invensys office in Crawley for the event. Mike Teller agreed to let us use the office and to talk at the event.</p>
        <p>24 September 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>The morning was really spent taking Dad to worthing hospital to have his stitches out. Hopefully now it will just be one trip to the nurse before a check-up in three months.<br />
        After a late lunch it was a trip to PDH to see if a Panda without an adjustable driver's seat was acceptable. It was not. So they are to tell us the options.<br />
        Later in the afternoon I travelled to Crawley again for an IET lecture, held jointly with the IMC. It was on the learning from the Buncefield disaster eight years ago.</p>
        <p>25 September 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Before lunch I went to B&amp;Q and bought paint for the study. I also bought a piece of beading for the garage doors.<br />
        After lunch I went up to the flying field. However, the mist came down and we had to stop flying. My only flight was not very successful. The nose wheel was not straight and so take-off was difficult. Then Alan seemed to think that I would not be able to land and so took over the controls.</p>
        <p>26 September 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Shopping day! We went to Dad's to make his shopping list and then went on to Holmbush. After lunch I walked down to Beeding to get my hair cut, then fitted the pieces of beading on the garage doors (and undercoated them) and washed the ceiling and walls of the study with sugar soap.<br />
        The MD of PDH phoned to say that he has authorised the ordering of the necessary parts and the retrofitting of the adjustable height driver's seat.</p>
        <p>27 September 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Angela was up early this morning, baking chocolate muffins! These were for the coffee morning that she was organising. While she went off to set up the event, I top-coated the beading on the garages door and started filling cracks in the study. Then I walked down to the church for a cup of coffee (and a piece of cake). After lunch we went to dad's. I walked him down to see the nurse while Angela tackled the front garden. Apart from his three-month check-up, he is now clear of medics. I then cut (well at least took the top off) his rear lawn. Then home, via B&amp;Q for some bulb fibre, to do a little more filling in the study.</p>
        <p>28 September 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Today we managed to remove the walls and roof of the shed (in one piece) from the floor. We discovered, of course, that more of the floor was rotten and so I had to go to Wickes for some treated timber to add new rafters under the floorboards and replace one of the battens on the ground. Cutting a floorboard to the right width took a long time, but I fixed the floor and Angela painted three sides.</p>
        <p>29 September 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The morning was spent painting the remaining side of the shed and positioning the floor back in its alcove. After lunch we lifted the body of the shed back on to its base, fitted the door and put everything back inside. Quite a successful weekend. I then painted the ceiling of the study. Exhausting!<br />
        We decided to apply for &#163;2,000 worth of Royal Mail shares. We will see what we are allocated.</p>
        <p>30 September 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>The morning was spent painting the woodwork in the study. In fact, it took until nearly three o'clock to complete it. I used a one-coat gloss paint so as to shorten the whole process.<br />
        After lunch Angela went to Bay's, but could not get any answer. Bay had got up late and did not hear the bell! While Angela then went to give blood I took my plane up to the flying site, where I found half a dozen people. My first attempt at taking off resulted in the nose wheel rotating and the plane tipping up. After some tightening, the wheel behaved and I managed five short flights, the last of which ended with.a 'dead stick', from which I managed to land on the strip.<br />
        I got home at five thirty and Angela arrived half an hour later, having been to Bay's again. While she got dinner, I painted the cupboard doors in the study.</p>
