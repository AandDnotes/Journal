        <p>1 August 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>I've been retired for a month! But I can't point to anything in particular that I've achieved. There have been odd jobs around the house and garden, there has been making my field box and there has been attempts at flying my model aeroplane.<br />
        Today I cut the top of the laurel bush at the top of the garden. I cut most of it before it became too hot (it was a very hot, sunny and humid day) and then finished it off after dinner. When it got too hot to work outside I went into the garage and mended the puncture in the back tyre of my bike. It had a new inner tube, but I had not checked that the tyre was clear of sharp objects. There was a thorn in the tyre! After that, I continued with my box, cutting the slots for the power panel cover. I think that I will need to reinforce the base, since the wood is warped already.<br />
        Just before four o'clock I dropped Angela near to Bay's (with her shopping) and went up to the flying site. There were half a dozen people there, sitting in groups since it was too windy for people to fly, apart from a couple of gliders. Nevertheless, I flew! The plane would take off in half the length of the field. I practiced low approaches and dead-stick landings, although I only landed a couple of times. On the final landing (bounce) the propeller broke. I have trouble judging distance. I keep thinking that my approach is in the middle of the strip, when in fact the plane is still off the strip in the long grass. Gordon brought the simulator, so I will see if it will install on Windows 8.<br />
        Alex the gardener finally called to give us a quote for trimming the trees in the front garden, plus a couple of other small jobs in the back.</p>
        <p>2 August 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>The morning started with me trying to install the borrowed simulator software. It started well with the installer asking me to plug. N the 'dongle', which it detected. But then it gave an error from the Windows 8 software that runs 32-bit applications. The only advice on the Internet was to download an updated version, but the web page has no information on it! I then pottered with my box in the garage until Angela returned from the village.<br />
        After an early lunch we collected Bay and they dropped me at Dad's while Angela took her to a clinic appointment and to the supermarket. At Dad's I did the usual top up of his pill box, but then we pottered in the garden, trimming his box hedge and moving some containers. When Angela and Bay arrived we had a cup of tea and then I called into the model shop to get some propellers.<br />
        I spent most of the evening doing both the weekly and the monthly accounts. Prior to that, I checked that Dad's standing order was paying money into his new Santander 1-2-3 account.</p>
        <p>3 August 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>An excellent day. It started, perhaps a little too early, with a bike ride down to the paper shop in Beeding. Going is easy, but coming back is up hill nearly all the way. I only just managed to get up Maudlin Lane!<br />
        We then set off for Paul's. The traffic was surprisingly light and it only took us one and a half hours. We walked into Twickenham for lunch in the garden of a pub and then walked home via two parks so that Rowan could play on the equipment. After a little rest I trimmed their privet hedge and Angela cleared their front garden. We had a wonderful time playing with Rowan. And the ride home was done in record time.</p>
        <p>4 August 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The day started early up at the flying field. It was the second day of the fun weekend. Apparently it was calmer today, but it was still very windy. Nevertheless, I had a few flights. But I had a lot of trouble with the sun (the pilot box was set up next to the tent) and I kept losing the orientation of the plane. Keeping the plane lower helped, but I could not maintain consistent circuits.<br />
        On my return from the field I tried to find a copy of Windows 98 to download, but eventually asked Paul for advice.<br />
        After lunch I worked some more on my box. Alex then came at about four thirty and spent three hours cutting the trees.</p>
        <p>5 August 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Today is our forty first wedding anniversary, but no one seemed to remember!<br />
        This morning we cycled (slowly) down to Shoreham Airport for lunch. It drizzled a little on the way down and then rained heavily while we had lunch. But it was fine on the way back. The restaurant was very busy. They seem to have expanded and now have tables in the entrance and another room.<br />
        On our return I downloaded an ISO file for Windows XP that Paul had uploaded, installed VirtualBox on the Mac and then installed XP in a virtual machine. The whole process was aimed T installing the RC simulator from Gordon. Unfortunately the CD seems to be a copy of the installed folder, rather than an installation disk.<br />
        During the evening we researched hotels on the Isle of White. I also spoke to Alan so as to arrange for Dad to go to Alan's that week.</p>
        <p>6 August 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>I take back what I said yesterday. We had a card from Alan and Chris.<br />
        Another morning spent at the flying field. It was fine and sunny, with little wind, but my ability to control the plane still leaves much to be desired.<br />
        I spent most of the afternoon working on my box. However, we did book the hotel and ferry (through the hotel) for our short holiday on the Isle of White at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>7 August 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>I made a final attempt at installing Gordon's simulator package by creating an installable file. However, it only unpacked the files into a destination folder. So the application file still failed following startup. I will therefore need to buy a simulator package.<br />
        While Angela went walking with the WI group, I started tackling the yew bush at the bottom of the garden. It took most of the day to trim the sides and then take out the crown. There is just a bit more sawing to do to remove the top of the trunk. We shredded quite a lot of the prunings. Tiring work.<br />
        Finally I trimmed the tongues on the sides of my box. Earlier in the day I glued in the two braces under the floor of the box.</p>
        <p>8 August 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>After deciding which photos of the grandchildren we wanted to print, compiling a short video of each and uploading them (photos and videos) to the iPad, we went off to Dad's to sort out his shopping list. While I was playing with pictures Angela walked down to the butchers to get meat for the next couple of days. Dad had recovered from his dizzy attack yesterday and decided to come with us. So after filling his tablet box we went to Tesco and M&amp;S and printed some photos. We stopped in the middle for a cup of coffee and a cake!<br />
        After taking him home, sorting out his shopping, showing him the photos and videos and returning home for a sandwich we took Bay's shopping to her. We had a re-run of the pictures and finally got home at about six o'clock.<br />
        Since we'd had a late lunch, Angela pottered in the garden while I fitted the new chains to the bird bath and glued the final piece of my box in place after trimming it. I now just need to cut and trim the power panel and make the draw before varnishing it.</p>
        <p>9 August 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Today I persuaded Angela to go into Worthing. We were too late to get the bus (and the model shop is a bit of a walk out of the town centre), so we went by car and parked in Waitrose. That meant that after going to Maplin, and the bank and looking at children's books/toys in tk-max and for bulbs in Wilkinsons we bought a few things in Waitrose and had some coffee. We then went to the model shop where I bought an RC flight simulator. Unfortunately, after installing it on my laptop I could not get it to recognise my transmitter. They had sold me the wrong adapter, so when the signals were correct it worked fine.<br />
        When I got back from my second trip to the model shop I trimmed the bushes down the side and did a bit more trimming of the pieces of my box.</p>
        <p>10 August 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>It was a popular morning at the flying site. Although I was the first to arrive, by the time that I left just after midday there were 14 people there. I practiced right-hand circuits to try to get the final corner right, and did some low-level approaches.<br />
        After lunch we tried the mower, which started and ran well (although Angela could not start it), but later it would only just start and keep running. It was hunting badly. While Angela was cutting the grass in the back, I went over to Dad's to cut his grass and help him change his bed.<br />
        I did manage to finish trimming the power panel piece of my box. We then had a call with Paul, Krista and Rowan. They are going to have a short holiday here after amour trip to the IoW.</p>
        <p>11 August 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>Following an automatic update of Windows 8, the laptop boots straight into Win 8! The HP system manager is still saying that updates Are needed, but they download and fail to install! I did the weekly accounts while trying to sort out the laptop, but it took most of the morning.<br />
        After lunch I cut off the top of the yew tree trunk, and shortened a few other branches.<br />
        Other than that, it was a day for reading the papers. Although I did re calibrate my controller on the simulator. However, the elevator is still not as sensitive as on my plane.</p>
        <p>12 August 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Our plan to cycle to Henfield for lunch was thwarted when Angela had a phone call asking her to help at today's lunch club. So we decided to go earlier, just for coffee. However, when we got into the road I fond that my front tyre was flat! I had already noticed that the rear tyre had lost pressure and pumped it up. So I looked at both and found thorns in both.<br />
        As a consequence I spent most of the day in the garage fitting the power panel to my box and building the draw. I cut the grooves for the bottom and made the bottom from an old piece of plywood.<br />
        I tried installing the Phoenix simulator on XP (in a virtual machine), but it seems that the version (SP1) is too old. I need to install DirectX, but the old version of IE will not respond properly to the MS sites for updating!<br />
        So I had a little practice on the Win8 version. I can't find a way to make the trainer better mimic my plane.</p>
        <p>13 August 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>I thought that Dad's appointment at the hospital today would be to actually cut out his skin cancers. But it turned out to be the first stage of the process within a new department! So it was agreed that he needed the growth on the back of his ear and a spot on his scalp removed. But he needs to go to Chichester for this, since he will need to stay in over night. The clinic was running an hour late, but we managed to get back by lunch time.<br />
        This afternoon I glued the remaining two sides of the draw for my box. I then set up a new savings account for Dad and arranged for BT to take over his phone and took the first step in cancelling his cable TV.<br />
        I also made our first attempt at rum punch. It was not quite the same as the ones we had on St Kitts, but was pretty good.</p>
        <p>14 August 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>We took the scenic route to Chartwell, going along the B2026 through the Ashdown Forest. It took a little longer than expected, but we arrived on time and shortly before Dick and Kate. The normal car park was full and the overflow car park only had a few spaces left.however, there were not signs about timed tickets, so we had our picnic before sanding down to the entrance. When we got there we found that all the tickets for the house had gone! So we looked at Churchill's studio (and listened to a good talk on the subject) and then walked around the gardens. Even so, it was quite late before we arrived home (Dick drove very slowly and we had to wait for him to catch up) and before we finished dinner. But the weather was fine and we had a good day.</p>
        <p>15 August 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Following a late breakfast we took Kate and Dick to Arundel. Their day starts with a cup of tea in bed at about eight o'clock, followed by a shower and breakfast at nine. So it was probably ten thirty before we left. We parked in Mill Road, just past the lake. We walked around the lake and then into the town for a cup of coffee/tea. After a walk around the town we drove back and tried to stop at the George and Dragon. However, their car park was full and so we moved on to the Bridge at Amberly. Dick bought us lunch to celebrate my retirement.<br />
        We then drove into Worthing to go to Slashpoint. We saw the new swimming pool and the modifications to the seafront before walking down the pier and having an ice cream on the promenade.<br />
        We then came home over the Downs and had bread/biscuits and cheese for tea (plus a bottle of wine).<br />
        I uploaded a few photos to Google+ to show the children where we had been.</p>
        <p>16 August 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>After a latish breakfast, Dick and Kate left at about 10:30. We then went over to Dad's. Angela compiled his shopping list and set off for Tesco. Meanwhile I filled his pill box and called Virgin Media to cancel his TV service. I also replaced photos of his great grandchildren in his frames. Since we were late starting, we had quite a late lunch. Angela then took Bay's shopping to her while I trimmed the draw of my box to make it fit and started varnishing it all.<br />
        Since we had some pineapple and a lime left (and we are both feeling tired), we decided to have another Caribbean moment and I made some rum punch!</p>
        <p>17 August 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>The weather looked just right for flying so I went up to the site. However, firstly the wind was picking up and secondly I had misinterpreted the e-mail from Alan. So I did not unpack the plane. Some one else (Les) was flying when I arrived, but he stopped due to the wind. So I came home and continued varnishing my box. By the end of the day it had all received two coats.<br />
        I also dismantled the fuel tank and carburettor on the mower and clean it out. However, it made no difference. It still took several attempts to start it (it runs for a few seconds and then stops) and then when it did keep running it was hunting badly. So after lunch I did the weekly accounts. I tried to register Dad's Barclays account for online access, but it would not accept my card number, even though it is linked to his account.<br />
        I tried moving the RC simulator to 100% rather than 50%. The controls became much more sensitive, but the model still did not behave like my plane. My attempts to take off and immediately land were pretty disastrous!</p>
        <p>18 August 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>After a walk to Beeding newsagents I spent most of the morning in the garage sanding my varnished box (particularly so that the draw and the power panel would fit), changed the connectors on the power panel and charger and moved everything over to the box. The draw is a tight fit and the power panel is either fouling the battery or the screwing the panel in place has warped the ply surround.<br />
        After lunch I dismantled the old picnic table by the greenhouse and we moved the sinks to that location. Angel is planning to make them in to alpine beds and we need the space on the patio for the shed.</p>
        <p>19 August 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>A bright, warm day. Just right for a bike ride. So we cycled up the Downs Link to Henfield and had a coffee in Truffles. Then we cycled back. The first part of the Downs Link from Bramber roundabout does not follow the course of the old railway, since the bypass is built on it. Therefore there are a few small hills. Angela has not yet become proficient with her gears and so usually got off and walked up the hills, complaining that her legs hurt. It took about an hour to get there and a little less to get back.<br />
        After lunch I filled the back of the car with the pieces of the picnic table and as much of the yew tree pruning as I could get in and we took them to the tip. From there we went to Dad's (he was asleep in the conservatory), ordered some more pills and picked up the letters from BT. We also had a cup of tea before taking some bags of rubbish to the tip (again).<br />
        I tried moving the C of G of the model in the RC simulator back to the centre of lift and increased the dihedral from three degrees to six, but it made little difference. I will need to measure the plane and model it more accurately.</p>
        <p>20 August 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>A beautiful sunny day that started on the Downs flying. As usual we were the first there, but by the time I left there were about a dozen cars, a van and a camper van. However, there were also a lot sheep and we needed to start by herding them to another part of the field. But the flying went well. I mainly practiced landing approaches and a few landings. Two landings were good, but several required the nose wheel straightening!<br />
        After lunch Angela took Bay to Parham House. It was actually some sort of WI outing, but they seemed to all go individually. Meanwhile, I straightened the nose wheel and measured my plane, did some calculations and modified the parameters of the model in the RC simulator. However, there is something wrong, since the elevator does not produce enough effect.</p>
        <p>21 August 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Another fine day and a productive one also. I modified the elevator throw figure in the simulation model and it seems to e much better. Then I emptied the shed. Angela went walking in the morning and after lunch we went to B&amp;Q and changed our troublesome mower for another make, even thou it cast &#163;50 more. The new mower I s still in the box since we spent the rest of the afternoon moving the shed and putting everything back. Everything, that is, except the bag of coal, that we gave to Terry, and the wood, that we gave to John. Now I can get at the windows that need repairing (and painting).</p>
        <p>22 August 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>Being shopping day, we went over to Dad's to get his shopping list. Angela had earlier been to Bay's to get her list and then went to the surgery to get new hearing aid batteries. Whilst there I arranged for a direct debit to pay his new BT account and collected his tablets from the chemist. We had a late lunch before returning home. While Angela took Bay's shopping to her I cleaned the facias behind the shed and cleaned up the windows, breaking away the rotten wood.</p>
        <p>23 August 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>Today started with a good flying session. Fine weather, but a bit of wind made it slightly difficult. However, I did a number of landings and eventually stopped after two good landings on the strip. I need to look at the nose wheel since some landings were a bit heavy. As usual, I was exhausted after the session.<br />
        After lunch I started work on repairing the sills on the windows behind the shed. I cut out the rotten ends of the toilet window sill and made new pieces to fit. I need to put wood preservative on the cut ends before gluing in the new pieces.<br />
        Apart from a trip to Steyning, Angela spent most of the day in the garden.</p>
        <p>24 August 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>A drizzly/rainy day. Angela went for a paper while I had a shower and then I went to Steyning after lunch (just as it started raining again) to get some wood preservative for the windows.<br />
        Otherwise I did the accounts, installed the RS DesignSpark software in my XP virtual machine, played with it for a while to establish that I could use it for my electronic schematics and managed to get the laptop back into legacy boot mode so that I can start up Linux. I also copied some photos of the grandchildren into the pictures folder so that they could e used for the screen-saver.<br />
        I also took the aeroplane nose wheel mounting off, straightened the leg and made the screw bight tighter. I also adjusted the servo link and modified the throttle link so as to get full throttle.</p>
        <p>25 August 2013<br />
        Sunday</p>
        <p>The main activity for today was to 'hand over' Dad to Alan. Dad and I left his house at five to nine and arrived at the Cobham services at ten o'clock. We sat with a coffee until 10:45 when I went to see if there was any sign of Alan. He was sat near the entrance, having arrived at ten past ten! But he did not see us sitting a little further back. I arrived home at 12:15, having bought petrol at Broadbridge Heath. I agreed with Alan that we will meet again at the same time next Saturday for the return journey.<br />
        This afternoon I cut some pieces of wood to fit the 'holes' in the small window, behind the sill ends that I had made. I also coated the cut ends of the sill and the new pieces with wood preserver.<br />
        We then spoke to Rowan and to Austin. Paul and Krista (who has had her hair cut) will come here next Saturday morning (for lunch). So I will go on my own to collect Dad. Victoria's visa application is progressing faster than expected. She now has an appointment for her interview, at 8:30 in the morning! However, Brandon has heard that a post harvest professorship (lecturer/researcher) is about to be advertised at UC Davis. He will apply, without telling Syngenta.</p>
        <p>26 August 2013<br />
        Monday</p>
        <p>Most of today, the day before we go on a short holiday, was spent working on the windows behind the shed. I primed the new pieces for the sill of the small window and glued them in place. I then cut away a large part of the large window sill and coated the bare wood with preservative.<br />
        Following that we walked around to Bay's so as to see her before we go away.<br />
        Finally we packed and showered for our early start in the morning.</p>
        <p>27 August 2013<br />
        Tuesday</p>
        <p>An early start (well, we left at eight thirty) to Portsmouth. The traffic was light and so we were twenty minutes earlier than the maximum one hour before departure. So we needed to go out of the terminal and pay to park for three quarters of an hour. At least we had a chance to look briefly at the Gunwarf Quay area and the Spinnaker tower. When we returned to the terminal for the 11 o'clock sailing we seemed to be loaded on to the 10:30 boat, which was running a little late. I guess they just fill the boat with whichever cars are waiting. It was a sunny, calm morning and so the boat took the 'short route' and we were in Fishbourne at about ten past eleven.<br />
        We drove through Ryde and turned off the main road to go to a small village called Seaview. There we were able to park (for free) and eat our picnic lunch on a bench in the shade of a tree and overlooking the Solent. Afterwards we drove on around the coast to Bedingham windmill. Apparently the only remaining windmill on the island. We also walked down to Steyne Woods because it was said that you might be able to see red squirrels there. But we did not even see any birds!<br />
        We arrived at the hotel at about three thirty, unpacked and went for our complimentary cream tea in the tea shop (more like a shed) accessed through the gardens. We then went for a brief walk along the coastal path before looking at the hotel facilities. The indoor pool is very hot and humid and the outdoor pool looks cold! We thEn sat in the garden and ad before showering and going down for dinner. We are in the older part of the hotel and so the bedroom, though not very large, has a high ceiling and a bathroom that is almost as big as the bedroom.<br />
        Dinner was a little disappointing. Angela made the best selection, but my crab started was spoilt by the batter and my Fisherman's pie was boring.</p>
        <p>28 August 2013<br />
        Wednesday</p>
        <p>Another gloriously sunny day. We had a late breakfast, leaving the hotel about ten thirty, and drove north, through Newport, to Osbourne House. We followed the steam of people around the house before walking down to the 'Swiss Chalet', where we had a light lunch. We then walked on to Osbourne beach and finally took the 'ring' path back to the walled garden. The relatively few rooms that are open in the house are interesting because they are more or less as Victoria left them, even though the house was used for other purposes after her death.<br />
        We got back to the hotel a little after three thirty and walked down into Shanklin Old Vilage and into Shanklin town.</p>
        <p>29 August 2013<br />
        Thursday</p>
        <p>After breakfast we walked into Shanklin to find a bus timetable, particularly being interested in busses that went to the Needles. So we set off along the coast through Ventnor (which was quite big) and on to Freshwater, where we found the long stay car park, left the car and caught the number 7 bus to Alum Bay. Just before getting there we met the back of a long queue of cars. However, the bus was called down the wrong side of the road so as to get to the Needles Park. Everyone else was queuing to get into the car park! We then walked the three quarters of a mile to the Old Battery. We went down into the searchlight tunnel and took photos of the needles. We then had a cursory look at the battery buildings before going up to the rocket testing site and the viewpoint, where I took more photos of the Needles. We caught the bus back to Freshwater, where we had a picnic lunch in the park.<br />
        From Freshwater we visited Mottistone Manor gardens (and had a cup of tea). The manor is lived in, but the gardens are owned by the National Trust. We then took an inland route back to Shanklin so as to miss the coastal road traffic.<br />
        After a short rest (and post of today's events) we walked down the steps to the beach. Luckily we found that you could walk up the other side of the Chine to the old village, which w a more gentle assent.</p>
        <p>30 August 2013<br />
        Friday</p>
        <p>An exhausting day. Another latish start at Luscomme Hall Hotel. We walked into Shanklin to buy food for lunch and then checked out. Angela had seen some 'windmills' in the Bembridge Mill NT shop (actually in the entrance hut) and expected to see them in other NT shops. Since we did not see them we went back to the mill to buy two, for you-know-who. We had thought of then going to an apple orchard for a cup of coffee before going to the ferry terminal. However, we were short of time and so we took the back roads to bypass Ryde (actually past the apple orchard) and went straight to the terminal. We did not get on to the earlier ferry, but we eat our lunch on board and arrived in Portsmouth shortly after one o'clock. We were then home just after three thirty.<br />
        Getting home, of course, was just the start. We then needed to go out to do the week's shopping for Dad, Bay and us. Unfortunately I forgot to take Dad's key with me and so we had to bring his shopping home with us. We took Bay's groceries to her and managed to get away quickly so that we could start cooking our dinner.</p>
        <p>31 August 2013<br />
        Saturday</p>
        <p>Well I was early at Cobham services to pick up Dad, but Alan encountered heavy traffic and was half an hour late. So, by the time that we had a cup of coffee, it was after twelve thirty before we arrived back in Steyning. Paul and Krista had already arrived and so we had a light lunch before Paul et al went off to meet up with Glen and we took Dad home, with his shopping. While there we changed his bed and sorted out his tablets. He had letters from Chichester hospital to go for a pre-op on Monday and the operation on Tuesday week. This means that we needed to rethink our plans to 'cat sit' at Paul's.<br />
        We were quite late starting dinner and Rowan was not keen to go to bed. So it was quite late effort we finished dinner.</p>
