        <p>Saturday 1st April</p>
        <p>A late start, a late breakfast and then a drive to Kenilworth Castle. We were able to use our Barclays reward to get entry for two into the English Heritage site. So we started with a light lunch and then toured the castle before tea and cake and then a drive home. Kenilworth was very good. After dinner we watched another film. This time it was on DVD and called The help (which we had seen on TV some time ago.</p>
        <p>Sunday 2nd April</p>
        <p>We had an even later breakfast this morning, eventually leaving Badby at about 11:30, heading for Clayton House in Buckinghamshire. We had been there before, but we toured the house and then had some lunch. Our journey back to the M40 was somewhat chaotic to start with, since we did not have a detailed map. We eventually arrived home just after five, only to find a bird in the house. We assume that it came down the chimney, but it had obvously been in the house for some time. We spent some time clearing up the droppings. In between we spoke to Paul and to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 3rd April</p>
        <p>We started by collecting Sam from the cattery. After Angela returned from Steyning we went to Dad's to help him change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. We also pulled quite a lot ruhbarb. After lunch I did the monthly accounts while Angela worked in the garden. I then tidied my 'bits' of electronics and checked that the two radio control transceivers are still working. Then I cooked dinner while Angela made some Easter buscuit dough and a ruhbarb fool.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 4th April</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning this morning and to a WI committee meeting this afternoon. Meanwhile I updated information on the STEM site and updated the flying simulator, then tried it out. I also glued another piece of sheeting to the Moth fuselage (under the cabane) and started collecting the bits I need to build a tailplane simulation to go with my transceivers. Later I went to Carwley for an IET talk on planetary photography, which was good.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 5th April</p>
        <p>This morning was maintenance time at the flying site. No starting time was specified, so I walked up to the site (40 minutes), arriving at 10 o'clock. I helped replace two poles on the electric fence and then helped fill some potholes at the entrance, before walking home. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I cut the grass, front and back. I tried contacting Chris Teasdale about the venue for the next talk, but the works number I have does not work and he did not answer his mobile.</p>
        <p>Thursday 6th April</p>
        <p>'Shopping day' says it all. We were a little later than usual starting, since we had to collect Bay's newspaper and deliver it to her before we went to Dad's. For a moment, as we approached Holmebush, we thought that the exhaust had fallen down on to the ground, but it must have been some external noise that was synchronised woth our movement. After a late lunch Angela delivered the shopping and I started putting together details of our 'contracts' for our successors. When Angela got home I cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 7th April</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning this morning while I continued to collect data for an 'important' information page and created a map and directions to get to the Cockcroft building. After an early lunch we went to Dad's, to take him his ruhbarb crumble, and then on to the Range warehouse where we bought things for Austin and Rowan to use, plus a dish and some gardening stuff. We then went to Sainsbury's to get some Euros. When we got home I had an email from Chris Teasdale about the revised venue for the Bloodhound talk. I sent the details to Julie Hudson since she had already left work. After dinner I went to the SRFC auction and bought a glider for &#163;10.</p>
        <p>Saturday 8th April</p>
        <p>Our day started like most other Saturdays, with a walk to the newsagents at Beeding bridge. After coffee and a short read of the paper in the sunshine Angela worked in the garden and I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling my spreadsheet against the bank statement. Following lunch in the garden Angela returned to her work and I started investigating the glider that I bought yesterday. I discovered that the motor and ESC are still available (at &#163;46 and &#163;49 respectively) and the two servos are at the cheaper end of the Futaba range (at only &#163;9 each from SMC). I also established what battery and receiver I could use. Angela, with a little assistance from me, then prepared a batch of ragu, made a beef casserole and made the foundation of a simnel cake.</p>
        <p>Sunday 9th April</p>
        <p>As usual I walked to the Beeding newsagents while Angela took Philip to church. Then I hung out the washing, put up the canes for the runner beans and changed the bed. Since it was quite a fine day we did quite a bit of sitting in the sun reading the paper. But, of course, Angela did quite a bit in the garden. I cleaned the glider's fuselage, stripped the black covering from the cockpit cover and glued the balsa sheet where it had cracked. We then spoke with Victoria et al and later, as we were finishing dinner, with Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 10th April</p>
        <p>I went to Dad's this morning to 'turn over' his bed clothes and fill his pill box. Shortly afterwards, John and Laura arrived. Meanwhile Angela went to help at the lunch club and went on to her WI meeting. After lunch I took the MG to Beeding to get some petrol. I cooked dinner while Angela sorted out her WI money. After dinner we went to the WSMGOC meeting at Worthing rugby club, where we took part in a quiz.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 11th April</p>
        <p>This morning Angela caught the bus to Storrington to pay her WI cash into the bank, while I started putting together a simulated tailplane for use with my transceivers at the hobbies fair. After lunch I went to a RCEA talk on the Buccaneer aircraft.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 12th April</p>
        <p>This morning I set off in the TC for the Black Rabbit in Arundel for the Sussex Wanderers run. After coffee and a natter we set off, arriving at the Gribble Inn in Oving for lunch. Although it was chilly when I set off, the sun came out during the run and it was very pleasant. I was then home at five past three after doing a total of 73 miles. Meanwhile, Angela did more preparation for our visitors and went to a funeral. When I got home I updated my 'outings' page and continued making my tailplane simulator for the hobbies fair.</p>
        <p>Thursday 13th April</p>
        <p>Today's shopping lists were longer than usual. At least, ours and Bay's were. As usual we started shopping in M&amp;S, followed by coffee and then shopping in Tesco. We were fairly late home and it was three o'clock before I went out to cut the grass, front and rear. I used the mulching attachment, which made the process a lot faster. Meanwhile, Angela took Philip and Bay their shopping.</p>
        <p>Friday 14th April</p>
        <p>Easter Friday, so this morning I collected Dad and then Bay and brought them over for the day. Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. After some cake and tea I got them home before it got dark.</p>
        <p>Saturday 15th April</p>
        <p>It wasn't a good night. The ache in my leg kept me awake for quite some time. We spent most of the morning shopping! Angela went to Steyning while I finished gluing together my dummy tailplane. Then we went firstly to the model shop (to get a battery connector) and then to Sainsbury's to buy nappies (and a few other things). After lunch Angela worked in the garden while I did the weekly accounts, emailed Chris Rickard and Hamish and spent a long time trying to get the Arduino IDE on the Elementary OS.</p>
        <p>Sunday 16th April</p>
        <p>I'd had a better night, but the ache in my leg was still pretty bad. So I did'nt go to the paper shop, but did various odds and ends instead. This included backing up my RC files and connection my new LiPo battery to the 'transmitter' end of my RC design. After lunch we cleaned the carpet in the front spare room and spoke with Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 17th April</p>
        <p>As usual on Monday's we went over to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. After lunch I tried to find out why the 'transmitter' is not receiving packets from the 'receiver'. But didn't. I also emailed the lecturer at Sussex who is to give a talk on AI for a synopsis. Although the sciatica pain was bad last night, it was intermittant, so I got some sleep. So far it has been a lot easier today.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 18th April</p>
        <p>An early start (after a poor night's sleep) to pick up the hire car in Littlehampton and then to collect Victoria et al from Gatwick. I got there just in time and then forgot to pay the parking before we went up to the car. However, we were home by about eleven. We then played with the children (including building a cardboard bus) and all but Austin had a sleep. As they were serving up dinner I went to Brighton for a talk on the Bloodhound SSC. We had a good turnout and it was a good talk.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 19th April</p>
        <p>Another early start. Hamish picked me up at seven o'clock and drove me to Eastbourne for the 'big bang' event. It was well organised and I was home at about four to find that everyone was still at Bay's. So I took the hire car round to pick them up. Austin was too tired to scoot/walk back! So we just brought him back so that Angela could start preparing the children's dinner. However, they did not go to bed until after nine! I replied to an IMechE member who complained about yesterdays talk.</p>
        <p>Thursday 20th April</p>
        <p>Not such an early start, but still a very busy day. Angela went off in the Panda to Holmebush to do the Tesco shopping while the rest of us went to Dad's, compiled his list and took him off to Holmebush. We met Angela and did the M&amp;S shopping (she had done all the Tesco shopping) while Victoria et al went off and found a present for Rowan. We then had coffee and and then all went back to Dad's before coming home for lunch (BLTs). V&amp;B took A&amp;J to the park while Angela took Philip and Bay their shopping and I dealt with some email, later starting the dinner. After dinner A&amp;J had a bath and we packed our cases for the morning. Finally by 9:30 all was quiet.</p>
        <p>Friday 21st April</p>
        <p>Back to early starts! We were up at six again this morning so as to get ready and drive to Gatwick for our trip to Rotterdam. Everything worked well and we were at Schiphol before Paul, who got stuck in a traffic jam. So we had something to eat while waiting for them. Austin and Juniper were pretty good the whole time. When they arrived we picked up a hire car and both cars set off for Berkenwoude. We got there at about 3:30. From then on we had coffee and cake, played games and had dinner.</p>
        <p>Saturday 22nd April</p>
        <p>We had a reasonable night's sleep, but were woken at 6:15 by Rowan! However, we managed to all get to a farm the other side of Berkenwoude to see all the cattle put out into the fields for the first time this Spring. There were lots of people and it was good fun. After lunch some went for a walk with flo, while the rest of us did nothing. Then Greet and Wim cam around.</p>
        <p>Sunday 23rd April</p>
        <p>This morning we headed for Kinderdijk. Actually we drove to Krimpen aan de Lek and cauught the ferry across the river to Kinderdijk, then walked a little way up the row of windmills. We were then back for lunch by about 1:30. We played games in the afternoon before heading off for the pancake house at Krimpen aan den Issel, where we met Greet and Wim. We had quite a good meal (if you like pancakes) and got home about eight.</p>
        <p>Monday 24th April</p>
        <p>An exhausting day! Brandon was collected early to go to an interview, but the company took him to the site where he would be working rather than to where the people were who were to interview him! So he spent another hour travelling. We spent the morning playing with Rowan, Austin and Juniper, including going out in the garden and then after lunch, when Brandon arrived back, they went off to look at the area where the job is based while we looked after Rowan and Austin. That's while we are exhausted. After dinner we played yet more games.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 25th April</p>
        <p>We set off from Paul's fairly early (10:15), but still only just had time to get to Schiphol and through the system. We took our lunch on to the plane and then were home at about four. We then bought fish and chips from Shoreham.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 26th April</p>
        <p>We were not up early this morning. Austin came with us to collect Sam from the cattery, but Sam would not then come in from the garden until Austin and Juniper were in bed! Lots of washing was done and this afternoon I took Dad to his appointment at Southlands hospital. He had a spot on his neck frozen off, but otherwise things seemed ok.</p>
        <p>Thursday 27th April</p>
        <p>Angela set off to Holmebush this morning on her own to start the weekly shop while we were still getting ready. We then went to pick up Dad. However, our planned means of meeting failed us and it took a while to find Angela. We then had coffee before completing our shopping in M&amp;S. After lunch Angela took shopping to Philip and then to Bay, while V&amp;B (and J) walked to Bay's. Austin stayed with me. he played with lego while I did the accounts and then we played. I also spoke with Julie Hudson about the Sussex LN budget and emailed the IET committee.</p>
        <p>Friday 28th April</p>
        <p>Following Angela's trip to Steyning and my visit to the hygenist we all went off to the dinosaur park at Southwater Country Park. After a play in the playground we went to the cafe for lunch, then returned to the playground for ten minutes before returning home. Angela then took Bay to the chiropodist and garden centre while I prepared things for tomorrow's hobbies fair and cooked the dinner. At nine o'clock Austin and Juniper were still running around!</p>
        <p>Saturday 29th April</p>
        <p>I set off first this morning with my planes for the crafts and hobbies fair and Angela came down a little later with her trifle and cakes. We both then spent the day there, at least until 4:30 (although Angela came home a little earlier). I left my two planes (and the step laddrs) there for Monday, when we have a repeat performance. It was a fine day and when I got home they were all playing in the garden.</p>
        <p>Sunday 30th April</p>
        <p>We went off this morning to the Beeding playground (and the local shop) while Angela started preparing lunch. I left them there so as to help Angela and catch up with email and accounts. Later in the afternoon Brandon was collected by taxi to go to Gatwick and then Amsterdam, initially for a profiling session for the job for which he applied and then for a series of work meetings. He will be back on Friday. So for the rest of the afternoon we played with Austin and Juniper.</p>
