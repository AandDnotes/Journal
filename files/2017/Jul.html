        <p>Saturday 1st July</p>
        <p>Another busy day getting not very far. We both walked to the the Beeding newsagents and then spent a while reading the papers. Angela then did shredding in the garden while I did the weekly and monthly accounts. After lunch Angela went to help serve cream teas at the church and I 'played' with two mico:bits. I tried making them communicate via 'radio'. This worked with the Java Blocks language, but I spent a long time trying to get the Python code to run and, even when it did, I couldn't get them to communicate.</p>
        <p>Sunday 2nd July</p>
        <p>Yet another unproductive day. Angela took Philip to church and I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. I then updated the computers, backed up changed files and had a short look at the micro:bit radio code. I also posted a query about ignition timing on the MG-tabc forum. Following one reply I again measured the 'diameter' of the TC's distributor shaft. Another reply pointed me to a technical note about dismantling the distributor. Then we spoke to Paul et al and, after dinner, to Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 3rd July</p>
        <p>A busy day. I started by going to Davison School to help with a Wearable Technology workshop It didn't finish until one o'clock and so I did not get home for lunch until just after two. Meanwhile Angela had been helping people at the church. After lunch we went to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. We also tried to 'tame' the hydranger by his side gate. When we got home I measured the play in the distributor bushes. I need to replace the two bushes and the thrust washer! Later I replied to those on the mg-tabc group who had sent me comments.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 4th July</p>
        <p>We started the morning by taking Sam to the vet for her annual checkup and innoculation. She was very good, although has lost a little weight. We need to take her back to be weighed in about six weeks. After lunch I ordered new bushes, thrust washer and gear pin from the Distributor Doctor. However, I'm still unsure how easy it will be to remove the old bushes and fit the new. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden, cutting back the ivy. I then joined her and pruned mainly ivy that was growing over from the wood. Later I sent the photos and car information to the organiser of the Scout/Guide event at Ardingly.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 5th July</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went walking with her WI friends. They went to Slindon. Meanwhile, I received the documents for Friday's HUBSEE meeting. So I printed them and looked up the train times, all of which had changed since I bought my tickets! Even then the driver's overtime ban may cause some of the trains to be cancelled. I also got the python radio code to work on two micro:bits. While doing this I charged the battery for the glider. After lunch I took the glider up to the flying site to meet Gordon. The plan was to try flying the club's glider (with buddy box), but Gordon had left one of the wings at home! So we modified the controls on my glider, borrowed a 3S battery and Gordon flew it. I need to get another battery and try to get the throttle cut to work via a switch.</p>
        <p>Thursday 6th July</p>
        <p>We were up fairly early since the tree man was due at about 8:30. I checked the train departures from Shoreham and found that they were all on time. So there is hope for tomorrow. Shortly after the tree man arrived we went to Dad's to find him just getting up! We waited for him to have his breakfast and then went to Holmebush. Neverthelest we were home a little earlier than usual, to find the tree man clearing up. After lunch Angela took the shopping to Philip and Bay. I started by walking to Beeding (it was quite hot) to have my hair cut. Then I re-programmed the ESC in the clider to enable the brake. I then tried various ways of stopping the motor from a switch, but nothing worked. Various posts suggested that it could be done, but then came to the conclusion that it could not. So I will replace the throttle cut button with a toggle switch.</p>
        <p>Friday 7th July</p>
        <p>This morning Angela drove me to Shoreham station where I caught the train to London and then walked to Savoy Place. After lunch I walked to the Royal Academy of Engineering, just off The Mall, for the HUBSEE steering group meeting. I stayed there a while afterwards to read some GOG documents and then walked back to Victoria, where I had a baguette before catching the train home. We were back by nine o'clock. The HUBSEE meeting was more productive than the first. I also met the vice chair of the IMechE, who is keen for more collaboration.</p>
        <p>Saturday 8th July</p>
        <p>Since Angela had to go to Holmebush to buy food for the lunch club, she also bought a newspaper, therefore removing the need for me to walk to Beeding. So I did the weekly accounts and replaced the throttle cut button the the RC transmitter with a toggle switch. So it is now possible to stop the motor by flicking a switch. I also reviewed the IET programme entries and sent comments to Hamish. Then I emailed Daniel at STEM Sussex about the guide/scout camp, only to find that he is on holiday until Thursday! so I forwarded it to their general address. After an early dinner we went to the Music Society concert at the Steyning Centre. It was a Spanish quintet, playing mainly Spanish traditional songs.</p>
        <p>Sunday 9th July</p>
        <p>While Angela took Philip to church I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. During the morning I updated my glider web page and forwarded my mail to the general STEM address, only to find that Sarah seems to be on holiday as well. Later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul and then to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 10th July</p>
        <p>Angela was cooking at lunch club this morning. Meanwhile I went to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes, put on some washing and fill his pill box. After lunch I read the documents for tomorrow's GOG meeting and then took the TC out to get some petrol. After tea I drove it to the WSMGOC meeting at Worthing Rugby Club. The discussion was about the future of the club. Then I drove home in the dark.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 11th July</p>
        <p>I started the morning by taking the Energy Watch equipment to Brighton. However, it took half an hour to get from the Hollingbury road down to the University. So I went straight to Mithras House for th Gift Oversight Group meeting. Stephen Duderidge was obviously in a hurry, so we finished within the hour. I then returned the equipment and was home by midday. After lunch Angela went a WI committee meeting and I checked the TC's oil, water and tyres, prior to tomorrow's run. The rest of the afternoon was then spent trying to progress the Linux Time Machine server, but without much progress. I can get the iMac to connect via Samba, but can't make Time Machine see the drive.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 12th July</p>
        <p>Angela left the house first this morning, to meet up with her WI walking group. I left shortly after in the TC and drove to Billy's on the Road, just north of Billingshurst. After coffee about 50 people, in a selection of MGs, set off for a 25 mile drive, partly through the Surrey countryside, to a pub at Alfold Bars, on the B2133 just beyond Loxwood. It was well organised and I had a good run home, arriving at about three after a total of 63 miles. I then put the TC in the middle of the garage, ready to start work on the distributor. After an early dinner we picked up Dad and went to Chichester Theatre to see Fiddler on the Roof. It was very good and quite long (Dad thought the end of act one was the end). We got Dad home at about 11:30 and we were home by half past.</p>
        <p>Thursday 13th July</p>
        <p>Shopping day. We were off fairly early after a late night. In fact Dad was still eating his breakfast when we got there. Although we started with the usual M&amp;S food shopping, I then bought a jumper and a belt in their sale and we just did the rest of Dad's food shopping in Tesco. After taking him home we went to Sainsbury's to do the rest of the food shopping, since Angela had a good discount coupon. After a late lunch Angela took Philip his shopping while I filed down a washer in the hope that I will be able to get it behind the bushes in the distributor and pull the bush out using a bolt, nut and socket. Later we took Bay to the optician in Steyning. I left them there and came home to wait for the delivery of the equipment needed for the next two wearable technology workshops. Then I went back down to collect them and take Bay home.</p>
        <p>Friday 14th July</p>
        <p>It was an early start this morning to get to Brighton Aldridge Community Academy by 8:10 for the 'Wearable Technology' workshop. In fact I was there at ten to eight, although the STEM deliverer didn't get there untill half past. It was more chaotic than the last workshop, but the children did some good work, even if more time was spent on the T-shirt than on the electronics. So I was home by 12:30. After lunch we drove into Worthing for a collection of oddments. I found some cheap wire strippers in Bunce and we stopped at Halfords on the way home to buy a car washing brush.</p>
        <p>Saturday 15th July</p>
        <p>We had our usual Saturday walk to the newsagents before Angela prepared a salad and I removed teh distributor from the TC. We then drove to Lyminster, to the WSMGOC barbeque, held in a member's garden. It was a very large and quite spectacular garden and, luckily, it kept dry. When we got home Angela worked in the front garden and I dismantled the distributor. Unfortunately my home-made tool for removing the bushes was not up to the job. So I reassembled the distributor (putting on the new thrust washer since there was not one beforehand) and re-installed it. I will connect it up and set the timing tomorrow. I will also see if I can adapt my tool before I decide to cut the old bushes.</p>
        <p>Sunday 16th July</p>
        <p>After my usual walk to Beeding I finished re-installing the distributor in the TC while Angela was at church. Luckily the engine started and I was able to set the timing. I used Norman's method of finding the point of maximum revs and then advancing the timing to reduce the revs by about 50 rpm. I then also reduced the idle speed back down to 1,000 rpm. At this speed, the strobe showed an advance of 15 degrees (at least on cylinder 1. After lunch I took the car out on my usual figure of eight test run. All seemed well. I left the car in the middle of the garage so that I can give it a bit of a clean before Saturday's fete. By this time the headache with my cold was quite bad, so I simply sat in the chair for a while before we spoke with Victoria et al. Paul and Krista were at Ikea! So we spoke to them after dinner. Rowan was staying with Greet overnight.</p>
        <p>Monday 17th July</p>
        <p>Just before eleven I went to Steyning Grammar for the wearble technology workshop. I had to start the workshop on my own, since Noelle and Tongei had gone to the upper school! We had to find our own lunch and then, at teh end, pack up quickly. However, we left the heat web rolls behind. Afterwards I went to Dad's to fill his pill box, change his bed and put his washing on. I also looked at his sink waste, which is not draining properly. Angela was at a WI meeting this afternoon and, after dinner while she was counting her money, I went to the WSMGOC committee meeting at Adversane.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 18th July</p>
        <p>Angela had a busy day and I had a quiet one. This morning she caught the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash and this afternoon went to Fittleworth to a WI concert (with strawberries and cream). This morning I made a target for the guide/scout event. I then spent the afternoon sending details of our budget to the IET committee and trying to set up an Adestra email, but I couldn't find a way to create a link to an email or message. I then ironed four pairs of trousers!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 19th July</p>
        <p>Angela started by going walking with her WI friends while I moved my Adestra email forward a little and spent time reading the paper. After lunch we sat until afternoon tea time! Then I started 'cleaning' the MG while Angela prepared her WI gift-aid claim. It took some time to get the date format right. After dinner (we had a quick fish &amp; chips meal because we were late) Bay gave Angela her shopping list and said that her TV had stopped working. So I went round, pushed in the arial connections, and it all worked.</p>
        <p>Thursday 20th July</p>
        <p>Shopping took place this morning as usual. John phoned just before we left Dad's and then we met John and Laura in M&amp;S as we were heading for Tesco. We were home just before one to find a parcel for Paul and a copy of TCs Forever More from the Octagon Club, even though I hadn't actually ordered one (just put my name on an interested list). However, I was pleased to receive it at that price. So after lunch I spent some time glancing through it before I 'hacked' at the fig tree while Angela took Philip his shopping. Then I finished 'wiping down' the TC and applied a little wax.</p>
        <p>Friday 21st July</p>
        <p>Just before Angela set off for Steyning I went off in the car to Hove. I went to the Nut &amp; Bolt Shop to get a stud, nuts and washers to make version 2 of my bush extraction tool. I parked right outside the shop, but it took me a slong to work out how to use the parking machine as I took buying the pieces! Anywhay, I was home before 10:30, so I cut a large stem out of the fig tree and removed branches from under the big conifer. We had an early lunch since Angela was going to Knepp Castle for a 'wildlife walk'. While she was out I sent feedback to STEM Sussex on the wearable technology workshop, checked to see if my Adestra email problem had been resolved (it hadn't) and made my new bush extraction tool. Then I trimmed the bush beyond the laurel.</p>
        <p>Saturday 22nd July</p>
        <p>Today was the Lyminster Fete and I had agreed to take the TC along. There was a shower just before we were due to leave and so we kept the hood up, firstly going to Beeding to get some petrol and driving the 18 miles to Lyminster. We were there before eleven, but there was still an hour before the start. We coralled the classic cars and had coffee and muffins (not very good ones, provided by Fran). In addition to half a dozen MGs there were also three Austins there, two 7s and a larger vehicle, plus a Jaguar, a VW and another German model. It was a good, well supported fete, with lots of variety. However, just after one it started to rain and continued until three, when we left; although we were not the first classic car to leave. We were home about 3:30 and I dried off the car as much as I could. It was the wettest that it's been.</p>
        <p>Sunday 23rd July</p>
        <p>After a walk to the Beeding newsagents and while Angela went to church, I removed the distributor from the TC and managed to remove the old bushes. I did not use my extraction tool in quite the way I had imagined, but I got them out. So I left the new bushes soaking in oil and after lunch put them in the freezer. I did a little research on the wiper motor, since it was smoking (or perhaps steaming) on Saturday. After talking to Victoria (they were all up early) and then to Paul, I managed to insert the new bushes. I had to use a wooden block and a hammer, but they went in without too much difficulty. However, the shaft will not now fit through the bushes! I tried cleaning them out using emery paper, but I measured the shaft as 0.490&quot; and the hole in the bushes as 0.487&quot;. I did not expect the insertion to deform the bushes and may now need to ream them out.</p>
        <p>Monday 24th July</p>
        <p>Angela started by going down to Steyning. Then we went over to Dad's to 'turn over' his bed, put on some washing and fill his pill box. We also cut down some of the hydrangea by his front gate. After lunch I walked to the health centre to see a physiotherapist about my leg. He thinks it was just a torn muscle and has given me some exercises. When I got back I took my distributor body and shaft to Simon's, where we reamed the bushes to accept the shaft. When trying to reassemble the distributor I discovered that the lower bush is not quite pushed in far enough, since the gear wheel will not quite go on the shaft far enough for the pin holes to line up.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 25th July</p>
        <p>I spent the morning in the garage, reassembling the distributor and installing it. I pulled both bushes into the distributor body by a few thou each so that the hole in the shaft and the gear lined up and there was the minimum of end float without restricting rotation. After installing the distributor I adjusted the timing by finding the maximum revs and then retarding by 50rpm. I then took the car for my usual test route. It seems to be running very well. Afterwards I cut the grass, front and rear. Meanwhile, Angela went to the dentist, shredded some of the prunings pile and applied feed to the back grass. I also finally managed to launch my Adestra email and recieved six replies.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 26th July</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking, in the rain, with her WI group, I spent nearly all morning replying to responses to my Adestra email. However, of the ten responses we currently only have two more volunteers. However, some who don't have current DBS certificates might be able to help if they are 'supervised'. After lunch I removed the windscreen wiper from the TC and stripped it down. Before taking the gearbox apart I connected it to the dashboard socket to test that it runs. However, it looks as though it needs new brushes.</p>
        <p>Thursday 27th July</p>
        <p>We started our weekly shopping trip a little earlier than usual and, in spite of a larger than usual shop, we were home relatively early. After lunch I sent a few more emails about the guide/scout camp and then went into the garage to continue reassembling the TC's wiper motor. This took me the rest of the afternoon and I finished refitting it after dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 28th July</p>
        <p>During the morning we prepared for the arrival of Kate and Dick. They got here just after one, with the start of the rain. Since it rained for the rest of the afternoon we simply moved from the sitting room to the dining room, back to the sitting room, to the dining room and finally to the sitting room! The pizza dough that I made in the morning worked well when we cooked the pizza for tea.</p>
        <p>Saturday 29th July</p>
        <p>Kate and Dick don't rise early. I woke them with a cup of tea at about eight and we sat down for breakfast at nine. So it was quite late when we set off for Polseden Lacy, getting there at about midday for coffee. Since it was just starting to rain we went around the house first. It was very interesting. We then had lunch and walked, in the rain, around the formal gardens. We left there at about five and so were home by six.</p>
        <p>Sunday 30th July</p>
        <p>Another late breakfast and then Kate and Dick set off for home. The A24 north of Dorking was closed for the cycling event, so they were planning to to take a different route. We then walked to the Beeding newsagents. The afternoon was then spent trying to catch up on things like the accounts. We then spoke with Victoria, expecting Paul et al to be in Southampton.</p>
        <p>Monday 31st July</p>
        <p>The last day of July. We started as usual on a Monday by going over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. Alan and Chris were due to arrive for lunch, but we left before then so that we could go to Sainsbury's to get extra food for our impending visitors. After lunch Angel went in the garden and Mike and Hamish arrived to explore the ball-launch kits. We found that the device does not work because the hole in the wheels is too large for the spindle of the motors. However, we found a solution and worked out what we will try on the day. We also need to clean out the hole in a number of the wheels, so we each took four packs. I did one pack before Paul et al arrived. They had been to the New Forest and to Bognor.</p>
