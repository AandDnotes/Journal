        <p>Wednesday 1st November</p>
<p>I had a sleepless night, but we had breakfast in the hotel, walked across to Whole Foods to buy some sanwiches for lunch and then set off south down Highway 1 to the area known as the Big Sur. We stopped at various places to take photos of the coastal scenery, stopped for coffee at the Big Sur River Inn and then at the Julia Pfeiffer State Park. We followed a couple of trails around a bay where there was a waterfall and then had a picnic lunch. The other trail was closed, so we moved back further north to another State Park (we could use the same parking ticket) where there was a path to a beach. What we didn't know was that we had to wade through a river to get to the beach. The temporary 'seasonal' bridge had been removed the day before, so we had to take off our shoes and socks and wade through nine inches of cold water over a stony bed. The volunteer in the ticket office didn't tell us about this! We then drove back to Monterey and went out for a Chinese meal.</p>
<p>Thursday 2nd November</p>
<p>We checked out of the Mariposa Inn just before ten this morning and drove back to Davis, arriving just after 2:30. We chose to take mainly Interstates so as to keep the travel time to a minimum, even though it was more boring than a route through the mountains. We missed our first turn off Highway 1 and so had to cut across country, but found our way to Highway 101 which took us to I680 and onwards. We drove a total of 543 miles on our journey down to the Big Sur and back. I took the car back while Angela walked with Victoria to collect Austin from school. As I was walking back (it took over an hour) I met them in the park going to collect Juniper.</p>
<p>Friday 3rd November</p>
<p>It was an Autumn festival at Austin's school this morning and Victoria had volunteered us to help! So we took Austin to school while Victoria took Juni and then we helped set up the stalls. We then spent the rest of the morning running a stall. Angela and Victroria were on the 'make an acorn necklace' stall and I was on the 'paint a stone (to look like a skull)&quot; stall. After lunch I checked all the P.O. Money Card receipts before we went to collect Austin. After Victoria had collected Juni we all walked to a Mexican fast food shop. The idea had been for us to take them out for dinner, but it wasn't what we had in mind.</p>
<p>Saturday 4th November</p>
<p>This morning, Home Depot had a 'kids workdhop', so we took Austin and Juniper to the Woodland branch to build a model Humvee. We then went on to Costco to buy some food, getting back in time for the children's lunch (a hotdog bought in Costco) and for Victoria and Brandon to go to Sacremented for lunch and to collect some slippers that they had ordered for Austin. So we looked after the children for the first part of the afternoon, which included Juniper doing to sleep on my lap. Later, while Victoria was cooking, we took the children to the 'orange' park, mainly to play in the sand.</p>
<p>Sunday 5th November</p>
<p>Apart from taking Austin and Juniper to the park we did very little. For dinner we had smoked sausage (cooked in Brandon's smoker), chips and beans!</p>
<p>Monday 6th November</p>
<p>We spent the a lot of the day walking to Downtown Davis, buying train tickets and looking for the Arboretum. But we failed to find the latter. We stopped for both coffee and lunch in town. for dinner we had an interesting fish and spiced sausage meal, with the sour dough bread that we had bought in Davis earlier.</p>
<p>Tuesday 7th November</p>
<p>We got up latish this morning and showered, then, while Victoria worked, we went for a walk around the linear parks in this area, including a stop for coffee. After lunch we sat in the garden reading and experimenting with python. When Brandon was home and both Austin and Juniper had been collected from school we walked to a Japanese restaurant near SaveMart. It was a good meal.</p>
<p>Wednesday 8th November</p>
<p>We caught the 10:25 Capitol Corridor train from Davis to Oakland Coliseum station. There we walked across the bridge to the BART station. We struggled to put $6 on each of our BART cards because we did not have enough one dollar bills. Someone using the next machine gave us a dollar bill! We were then able to go on to the station and up to the airport link platform and take the shuttle train to the airport. Getting through passport control and security was very quick, since there was hardly anyone there. We then ate some lunch before boarding the plane, which left on time. Angela read for most of the flight and I watched two films. Neither of us slept.</p>
<p>Thursday 9th November</p>
<p>Nine and a half hours after taking off (with no sleep) we landed half an hour early, met Russel and were home by 11 o'clock. We then walked to Steyning to buy some lunch and some meat. After lunch we went to Holmebush to buy food, took some to Dad's and then on to Bay's. At both places we turned on their heating. Then an early night.</p>
<p>Friday 10th November</p>
<p>There were two main parts to the day. The morning involved collecting Dad from Victoria Grand and the afternoon involved collecting Bay from Valerie Manor. Dad liked his stay and wants to know how much it would cost to live there fulll-time! Although Bay thought the place was good, she hardly left her room.</p>
<p>Saturday 11th November</p>
<p>As I arrived home after walking to Beeding to buy a newspaper, Angela phoned to ask me to join her at the the church to sell lunch tickets. It was their Christmas Bazar and Angela was helping prepare lunches. We had sold out of lunches by about 1:30, so we had our lunch and then I came home while Angela helped clear up. I did the weekly and monthly accounts, including reconciliation with the bank statement.</p>
<p>Sunday 12th November</p>
<p>While Angela went to church I started reviewing and modifying our holiday photos. This afternoon we spoke with Paul and Victoria.</p>
<p>Monday 13th November</p>
<p>We were woken at 5am this morning by a call from Bay saying that she had just called 999 since she had unbearable pains in her legs. She called back at about six and the paramedic said that they were taking her to A&amp;E. So after an early breakfast and shower we went to Worthing Hospital to find her. I left Angela with her and went to Dad's to turn over his bed, do his washing and fill his pillbox. I then went back to A&amp;E to collect Angela and bring her back to help at the lunch club. After my lunch I cut the front grass and rear, top lawn. We then went to Bay's house to pick up a few things before returning to the hospital. She had been moved to the Emergency Ward. It was seven o'clock before we left.</p>
<p>Tuesday 14th November</p>
<p>I sorted out a new tariff for Dad's energy. It is much more than the last one, but starts by keeping the same monthly direct debit amount. I then spoke with Pete at the Octagon Club about my hub and half shaft. I sent him a photo of the oil filter holder so that he could chose the right size. When Angela got back from Steyning she cooked lunch, after which she went to a WI committee meeting and I went to an RCEA talk at Field Place. Afterwards, we went to visit Bay. She had been moved to the Bacton ward. We did not get home until just before 7:30.</p>
<p>Wednesday 15th November</p>
<p>The day started with John Berry arriving with torch kits, etc. for next week's Beaver event. After that I spent a good part of the day drafting the IET Sussex LN newsletter for November. By this evening I had sent a test copy out to Bernard and John. Angela went to Steyning this morning and to table tennis after lunch. We both then went to visit Bay in Worthing Hospital. She is still halucinating, although was not breaking down today. I also emailed someone in Beeding who has restored a TA. Unfortunately his wife replied this evening to say that he has advanced dementia, but she though that he would enjoy seeing my car.</p>
<p>Thursday 16th November</p>
<p>Thursday is shopping day, but we only needed to shop for us and Dad, with a little for Philip. We collected Dad and started by buying some clothes. So we were a little late finishing. After Angela had taken Philip his shopping we went to Worthing Hospital to visit Bay. However, she was asleep in the chair when we arrived and seemed reluctant to wake. So we spoke to her Doctor. It seems that she has an infection in ulcerated legs. They are about to give her antibiotics and fluids intervenously. So we went for a cup of tea and then went back. She had been moved into her bed, but was still asleep. So we came home, leaving her a note.</p>
<p>Friday 17th November</p>
<p>A busy day. While Angela went to the doctor's about her ears and then on to Bay's, I drove over to STEM Sussex to return the 'wearable technology' box and borrow the Beebots. Actually I brought back the whole Control Technology box that contains the BeeBots (plus controllers). After trying to book pantomime tickets online we drove to Shoreham, parked and caught the bus into Worthing. I seems that their online booking system was still 'holding' the seats that we had tried to book. So we went off to have lunch and to Carphone Warehouse to buy a plan for my mobile (actually for the iPhone 4 that Victoria gave me). I ended up with a &#163;5/month SIM only plan. We then went back to the theatre and booked tickets to take Rowan to see the pantomime before we went to the hospital to see Bay. She was much more lucid, although her legs look bad. My hub and half shaft arrived just before we went out. The hub does not have a hole for greasing the bearings.</p>
<p>Saturday 18th November</p>
<p>My throat was still sore. So while Angela went to Bay's and to Steyning, I test fitted the new hub/half shaft and glued the sleeve over the splines. It needs to cure for 24 hours, so I put it by the radiator in the study. Then I started sorting out our holiday photos. Later I put together some of the video clips that I had taken. Then I uploaded everything to the iPad for use tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sunday 19th November</p>
<p>Dad's 94th birthday. While Angela went to church I installed the hub/half shaft, filled the differential with oil, put back the toneau floor and lowered the car to the floor. I was just checking the tyre pressures when Alan phoned to say that they were at Dad's and would be shortly leaving for the restaurant. Shortly afterwards, Angela returned, so while she went to Bay's to pick up her newspaper I changed and we left for Lancing. We met them in the car park and then had a good lunch. Afterwards we went back to Dad's, while Angela went to the hospital to visit Bay. We agreed that I would try to get Dad into Victoria Grand! I had taken my costing calculations and so will phone them tomorrow. I will also request quotes for an 'immediate needs annuity'.</p>
<p>Monday 20th November</p>
<p>The main activities today revolved around Dad's care home. It was agreed that Dad would have the larger room from Monday 11th December, at &#163;800 per week. In the morning I went to Dad's to change his bd, do his washing and fill his pill box. I also arranged for a financial adviser to visit to discuss funding options. After lunch, Angela went to WI meeting and then went to visit Bay in hospital. So I cooked!</p>
<p>Tuesday 21st November</p>
<p>This morning, while Angela took the bus to Storrington to pay in her WI cash, I spoke with the speaker from eon about Rampion. After lunch, after Angela had left to visit Bay, I took the TC for a test drive. Then Hamish arrived and we went to Crawley to a Beaver meeting.</p>
<p>Wednesday 22nd November</p>
<p>We started by driving to Moulscoombe to return the BeeBots to STEM Sussex, Calling in to the Maybury garden centre on the way back for coffee and to buy some plants and presents. It was a fine day, so after lunch I phoned the Beeding TA owner to see if he would like to see my car. But he is in hospital and his wife said that he is unlikely to recover from his dementia. So I cut the rest of the grass while Angela went to table tennis and then to visit Bay. When she got back I took the car to Falmer to an IET talk, while Angela went to a flower arranger's meeting with Sandi.</p>
<p>Thursday 23rd November</p>
<p>We started as usual on Thursdays by driving over to Dad's and taking him to do food shopping. After lunch Angela took Philip his small amount of shopping and then went off to visit Bay. I had planned to put the MG on stands and check the rear axle and adjust the brakes, but I did not feel up to it. So I added descriptions to all the photos from our trip to California and then cooked a simple dinner. I also updated the OS on the MacBook.</p>
<p>Friday 24th November</p>
<p>My cold and cough were bad today. So I did little other than respond to IET email. Angela went to Steyning this morning and then to the doctors this afternoon to have her ears seringed. Afterwards she went to visit Bay. I set up my old phone for Angela and backed up my new (old) iphone.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th November</p>
<p>This morning we drove to Wisley to meet Kate and Dick. It was crowded. They arrived just before us, but we were parked a long way from each other. It was sunny, but cold. We had a good day, although it was quite tiring, probably due to my cold. We left Wisley at 5:45 and were home just after six.</p>
<p>Sunday 26th November</p>
<p>I stayed in, nursing my cold. However, Angela went to church and then, after lunch, went to visit Bay. I did the weekly accounts and then only had to heat up a casserole that Angela had cooked on Friday and cook some jacket potatoes and brocholli. We ate at lunchtime so that Angela could go to see Bay and get back for calls with Victoria and Paul.</p>
<p>Monday 27th November</p>
<p>After Angela went to a meeting this morning we went over to Dad's to 'turn over' his bed and fill his pill box. On the way back we called into Currys and ordered an iMac. After lunch Angela visited Bay and then, when she got back, I went to an IET Sussex LN committee meeting. My cold is still bad, but at least we got a new Younger Professional Chair.</p>
<p>Tuesday 28th November</p>
<p>This morning I went over to Dad's to take him to the bank, where we had me added to his current and savings accounts. This way I will have online access to his accounts. After lunch Angela went to visit Bay and I walked down to the health centre to collect my prescription and get advice from the pharmacist about my cold.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29th November</p>
<p>This morning I had a visit from a financial adviser to talk about funding residential care. It was interesting and highlighted a few things to put in place. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and then off to visit Bay, while I compiled the minutes of Monday's IET committee meeting. I also removed the valve from the shower room cistern because it was leeting water into the bowl. However, the fixing points are broken! My cold/cough is still bad.</p>
<p>Thursday 30th November</p>
<p>As usual on Thursdays we went shopping. Dad did not join us since he had problems with his leg. Later, Angela took shopping to Philip and then went to visit Bay in hospital. I paid Dad's carers bill, told them that thier services would stop and arranged for an estate agent to visit tomorrow about the value of his house.</p>
