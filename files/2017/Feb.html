        <p>Wednesday 1st February</p>
        <p>I started by booking flights to Amsterdam for us, V, B, A &amp; J. Then I booked a 7-seater hire car (the same one that we hired last year) for the time that they are here and booked parking at Gatwick for when we go to Paul's. Unfortunately, the hire company has moved from Worthing to Littlehampton. I also booked Sam into the cattery. Meanwhile, this afternoon, Angela went to table tennis. Later I continued working on the Moth. But I made a mistake with one of the laminates for the cowl front and had to make a second one. While we were eating dinner, Bay phoned to say that she could not make her TV do anything. So I went round to find that an ornament was between her and the detector!</p>
        <p>Thursday 2nd February</p>
        <p>As usual we started by going to Dad's and then on to do the weekly shop, stopping for coffee between M&amp;S and Tesco. After lunch, while Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, I finished making the laminations for the front cowl of the Moth and glued them together. Then I started trying to shape it.</p>
        <p>Friday 3rd February</p>
        <p>A busy day. This morning I checked the supply of torch kits and literature before going to meet Hamish, John Halliday and Adriad Oldknow at Eastergate for lunch. We talked about schools activities, IET talk schedules and the micro:bit. I also saw Hamish's Triumph Dolomite. I got home about 3:30 and did some work on the Moth's cowl. After dinner I went to an SRFC meeting at the Hillbarn Golf Club. It was a little dissapointing, since there was little on display.</p>
        <p>Saturday 4th February</p>
        <p>It was raining when we left for the Beeding newsagents, even though we were late up. However, it stopped just before we got there. I then spent the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon doing the weekly accounts and the monthly accounts. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden. I then completed shaping the Moth's front cowl.</p>
        <p>Sunday 5th February</p>
        <p>This morning I got to the newsagents and back before someone called to look at the travel cot. I had advertised the cot in Friday-Ad before Christmas, but this was the first reply. After struggling to get the cot to stay up I found the technique and the buyer was able to do it herself. So she bought it for &#163;20. After emailing Mark Sylvester about the SRFC attending the craft fair I returned to the Moth. I had thought that I had finished shaping the front cowl of the Moth, but, after looking at photos of a real Moth, decided that it was not rounded enough. So I glued some extra pieces of obechi inside and carved it further. Then I cut the holes in the front. I also emailed the potential SLO. Later we spoke firstly to Paul and then to Victoria. V has a busy week. Brandon is going away (to a conference) from Tuesday to Thursday, she is going to a school information evening on Wednesday and Claudia and Gene arrive on Saturday with the twins. They then leave for Anhein and Disney World on Sunday, with Austin!</p>
        <p>Monday 6th February</p>
        <p>We started by going to Dad's, staying a little longer than expected because his washing machine decided to stop in the middle of the cycle. So we had to make it do a separate rinse cycle. After lunch I spent a lot of time emailing various people; turning down an invite to join the WSMGOC committee and replying to invites to schools events. I then spent some time reading about power train selection for the Moth. I keep thinking that the front cowl is done, but I had to remove wood from the inside top edge, so as to provide more room for the motor.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 7th February</p>
        <p>Today, my only outing was to hang out the washing! Otherwise I spent more time researching motors and propellers for the Moth. I spoke to someone at 4-Max, who suggested a suitable motor. I also noticed that slightly larger Moths use a 12&quot; prop, whereas my plan states a 10&quot; prop. I found that the scale size should be 11&quot;! Yet again I did some wittling on the cowl front, removing material from the inside around the propshaft so that the motor can go far enough forward. I also started making the pieces that connect the front cowl to the firewall. This was all interupted by needing to cook my lunch, since Angela went to the Tollgate with her table tennis friends.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 8th February</p>
        <p>We carried and dragged the old sofabed out on to the drive before 8:30 this morning. But it is still there. We had arranged for Horsham Council to collect it between 8:30 and 4pm. I phoned just after four, but they did not know of any problem and said they would phone back. They didn't! Then Angela went walking, followed by lunch at the Castle and then table tennis. When she got home she made two cakes! The furthest I walked was to the drive. Otherwise I researched 'cloud' drives on the Linux system and made the underside of the engine bay on the Moth. It now needs some fettling to make it all fit.</p>
        <p>Thursday 9th February</p>
        <p>Today we expected the old sofabed to be taken away and the new sofa to arrive. The latter occurred, but the former did not. Horsham say that it will be collected tomorrow! The new sofa arrived just after one o'clock, so there was time for us both to do the weekly shop. Multiyork were very efficient. While Angela took the shopping to Bay I did some more fettling to the Moth's front cowl and then I went to Crawley to an IET talk on cyber security.</p>
        <p>Friday 10th February</p>
        <p>Angela had a busy day. She started by walking down to Steyning and then went to Tesco berfore lunch to buy food for the lunch club on Monday. Meanwhile I spent a lot of time organising and buying train tickets to go to the HUBSEE Steering Group meeting later this month. I bought 'super off peak' tickets, which means that I cannot travel home as early as I would like. I also booked Sam into the cattery for our trip to Badby at the end of March. Then I did some more fettling and 'tacked' in place the front cowl and floor of the engine compartment. Next it is the dummy fuel tank in the centre of the top wing.</p>
        <p>Saturday 11th February</p>
        <p>We were late to rise this morning, but found a light dusting of snow on the grass and roofs. Is tried to snow a little as we walked to the nesagents, but then snowed harder after we got home. However, it did not settle and had all dissapeared shortly after lunch. Before lunch I did the weekly accounts and checked off the entries on the bank statement, finishing the reconciliation after lunch. I then spent some time trying to work out how the centre section of the top wing of the Moth (the fuel tank) should be put together, looking at photos of a real Moth to help. I concluded that there are some omissions on the plan; just a couple of dotted lines. The real tank is made from corrugated metal, so I filed a small piece of aluminium to make a scraper and started 'carving' pieces of sheet balsa to give the effect of corrugation. We then spoke to Victoria, since Gene and Claudia (with the twins) were due to arrive later in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Sunday 12th February</p>
        <p>I walked to Beeding as usual while Angela took Philip to church. Then I wasted more time trying to get the Linux system to communicate with the iMac. But I did produce the first section of 'corrugated' balsa for the Moth's fuel tank. We then spoke with Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 13th February</p>
        <p>Angela left early to cook for the lunchclub. Later in the morning, after making another piece of 'corrugated' balsa for the Moth, I went over to Dad's. Since Angela was having a meal at lunch club, I took some fish and chips to Dad's and had lunch with him. It was a fine, sunny day, so when I got home I started the TC and took it out for a run (twice around my figure of eight route, picking up Angela on the way back. After dinner we both went over to Kirsty and Jason's to talk with the neighbours about the wood being put up for sale.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 14th February</p>
        <p>Following yesterday's chat about the wood, I looked up the map of the plot that shows the boundary and sent it to the other's in the road who are interested in possibly buying the wood. I also emailed Tom Wright, who later invited me round for a cup of tea. John opposite had also run into Tom's wife, Fiona, and found that they might be interested in joining us; a view also expressed by Fife in the Lodge. Meanwhile Angela went to Steyning. Before lunch we took Bay to the health centre, getting home in time to eat our lunch and then go out. Angela went to a WI committee meeting and I went to an RCEA talk on smart meters. He was a very good speaker.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 15th February</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we took Bay to the dentist. She had her broken front tooth, which was almost completely broken off, reconstructed. I then dropped Angela at table tennis and did a little work on the Moth. In between I tried to find information of trusts. Before dinner I went round to Tom Wright's to talk about the wood.</p>
        <p>Thursday 16th February</p>
        <p>The usual Thursday shopping trip. We were a little earlier than usual and so got home reasonably early. This afternoon I did a little more on the Moth and this evening we went over to to John and Val's for a chat with the 'wood sub group'. We agreed on an upper limit with which we all felt comfortable, Jon is to talk to a solicitor who specialises in land deals and I am to talk to Tom about getting his son to talk to Burts. I will also talk to the planning office at Horsham.</p>
        <p>Friday 17th February</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning this morning I mailed Tom about the discussions of the wood group and then spoke to someone in Horsham planning department. But it did not reveal anything. I later updated the group. I also spent some time working out the required dimensions of the Moth's fuel tank and started cutting components. After lunch we went into Worthing, to Maplins, the model shop and then to the 'foam' shop where we ordered new pieces for the kitchen chair cushions.</p>
        <p>Saturday 18th February</p>
        <p>It was a day of doing small jobs. After walking to the newsagents Angela spent most of the day in the garden while I did the weekly accounts and cleaned up and sharpened her secateurs. Later I tried the higher value capacitor on my flasher design with a virtual ground. It worked, but only provided 6V to the lamps. I then glued the pieces together for the frame of the Moth's tank.</p>
        <p>Sunday 19th February</p>
        <p>While Angela took Philip to church I did the usual walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper. Angela didn't return until just before four o'clock, since they had lunch and their AGM. Meanwhile I mailed members of the IET events sub-committee who had not yet replied about tomorrow's meeting, updated eOS and Windows and shaped the cross-members of the Moth's tank. I was talking with Paul (and Rowan) when Angela got home. We then talked with Victoria (and Austin).</p>
        <p>Monday 20th February</p>
        <p>We were quite early at Dad's this morning and it didn't take long to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. So, after a chat, we went off to Sainsbury's at Lynons Farm to have coffee and then buy the food that I needed for the evening's IET events sub-committee meeting. After an early lunch Angela went to her WI meeting while I 'played' with the fuel tank on the Moth. I need to make sure that everything lines up properly. It looks as though I will have to unbind the lower end of the btacing wires on the canbane so as to pull the rear canbane wires into position. After her WI meeting Angela went to give blood, but they wouldn't take it! She returned in the middle of lur IET meeting.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 21st February</p>
        <p>While Angela caught the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash I dismantled the base of the water but by the wood and leveled it. I did a little more on the Moth, working out how to fix the fuel tank at the right angle. I also started to unbind the canbane bracing wires so that they can be adjusted. This is going to take some time. This evening I went to Falmer to an IET talk on optical computing (classical and quantum). It was really hard going!</p>
        <p>Weddnesday 22nd February</p>
        <p>I spent the day doing two things today. I worked on the Moth's tank on and off, but went to Tom Wright's at 11:30 with John to meet and talk with Tom's son, Tim. We learnt quite a lot and after lunch I drafted a summary of the discussion for John's review. Later I sent it out to the group. Basically, if we want the wood then we will need to pay considerably more than we originally thought. While I was writing my notes of the discussion Angela went to table tennis.</p>
        <p>Thursday 23rd February</p>
        <p>Storm Doris passed over the UK today, so we suggested to Dad that he didn't go out in the wind for his paper. So we took his order and went straight to Holmebush. We actually finished our shopping by 10:30 and then had a coffee. After lunch Angela took Bay her shopping while I sorted out the maps and documents I need for tomorrow's trip to the STEM meeting in London. I alsocut the root ribs for the Moth's tank. I also 'un-bound' the canbane bracing wires from the longerons. Although I don't know how I will change the bend in the ends. I also invited the wood group here for a chat on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Friday 24th February</p>
        <p>A very tiring day. It started by catching the train from Shorham to Victoria, standing for half the journey. I then walked through St James Park and on to Savoy Place for the rest of the morning and for lunch. Then I walked to the Institution of Civil Engineers HQ at Westminster for the first HUBSEE advisory group meeting. From there I walked back to Savoy Place before walking down The Strand and The Mall and on to Victoria to get the (packed) train home. I walked about six miles during the day. Meanwhile Angela took Bay to the chiropodist and the garden centre before coming to collect me at Shoreham station. I got home a little earlier than expected at 8:30.</p>
        <p>Saturday 25th February</p>
        <p>After yesterday's exhaustions we had a quieter day. We started with a gentle walk to the Beeding newsagents, then Angela spent a lot of the day working in the garden. Meanwhile I did the weekly accounts, sent off my expense form to Roger for the sub-committee food, emailed the IET Sussex LN committee about the CVC actions and started looking at the IET Career Manager. I also made up a rig to help align the Moth's tank, but I should have done that before fixing the canbane wires in place!</p>
        <p>Sunday 26th February</p>
        <p>I was too late this morning to find any Telegraphs at teh Beeding newsagents and so had to walk on to the BP petrol station. I cut a handle off a wicker basket for Angela and sorted out some pieces of wood and jar tops out of which I could make a set of scales. Then I started filling in details on the IET Career Managere application to record CPD activities. After lunch the neighbours called for a meeting on the wood. We then spoke with Paul and then Victoria. In fact it was late before we even had a chnce to start cooking dinner. Paul had suffered from storm Doris, losing the new roof on his workshop. Also, Austin did not get a place at the Spanish Immersion school. He is on the waiting list.</p>
        <p>Monday 27th February</p>
        <p>Angela started the day with a walk down to Steyning while I phoned Burt estate agents to arrange to meet with Andrew Finch about the wood. Then we went over to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes and fill his pill box. When we got home I reviewed John's notes for our talk with Burt and after lunch spent most of the afternoon making a pair of wooden scales for Angela. Then John phoned to say that he had found an entry on the South Downs National Park Authority planning web site about the wood. Before and after dinner I looked at the documents, which were about a pre-application advice request, and emailed the rest of the group.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 28th February</p>
        <p>A quieter morning for me today. But after lunch John and I went to talk to Andrew Finch at Burt about the sale of the wood. I later sent round my notes on the discussion, before going off to Crawley for an IET committee meeting.</p>
