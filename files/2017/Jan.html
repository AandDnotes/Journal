        <p>Sunday 1st January</p>
        <p>I tried out my new coat this morning. It had been raining before I went for the paper, but I kept mainly dry. Meanwhile Angela went to church and I did some more work on my flasher unit design (I had forgotten to add the buzzer). Later in the afternoon we spoke to Victoria and then to Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 2nd January</p>
        <p>We had invited Bay and Dad around for the day (in place of New Year's Day), so I went over to Dad's, 'turned over' his bed clothes, filled his pill box and brought him back. A little later I collected Bay (and her loe seat). So we had lunch, sat, talked (one or two slept), had some tea and then I took them home. We had to scrape the winscreen!</p>
        <p>Tuesday 3rd Janaury</p>
        <p>A cold start. It was very frosty. Angela went off to Steyning after breakfast, but I spent a lot of the day working on my flasher unit. My breadboard version works, but I need a seperate earth for the 555 timer (I guess because, when connected to earth through the lights, the ground voltage level is higher), which isn't available the way that the switch is wired. Later in the afternoon Angela went for a walk up the Downs. Later still, I drove to Crawley for an IET talk on 'time of day'.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 4th January</p>
        <p>A qiet day. Angela went out to make a hairdresser's appointment, but otherwise we stayed at home. Again I spent a lot of the day working on my flasher unit. I have it working (including the buzzer), but need to investigate whether or not I can modify the wiring ofd the TC. I also started building the wooden tram that Victoria et al gave me for Christmas.</p>
        <p>Thursday 5th January</p>
        <p>Shopping day. We collected Dad and went off to Holmebush, starting with coffee in M&amp;S. We were home reasonably early and Angela went off to Bay's earlier than usual, since Philip was out this afternoon. Meanwhile I removed the TC's indicator switch from its mount and researched its constrction, working out how the installation currently works. I also did the month;y accounts, adding the two new Kent Reliance accounts, and updated the dividend information.</p>
        <p>Friday 6th January</p>
        <p>Angela went to Steyning this morning and then went back after an early lunch to have her hair cut and call into Bay's. Meanwhile I worked on the model tram. However, after she returned (less some hair) we took down the Chistmas decorations, including clearing up the needles that fell off the tree as I took it out.</p>
        <p>Saturday 7th January</p>
        <p>We both walked to the Beeding newsagents this morning, extending the walk up Sopers Lane for a look at the building just before the farm. According to Terry, planning permission for a 'barn' was running out, so the owner built what looks more like a house. I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts, including reconciling with the statement, which was extensive over the Christmas period. After lunch I spent the rest of the day completing the model tram. It runs down the sloping track, but the elastic band, when wound, bends the 'cocktail stick' axle so that the gears do not mesh! We also spent some time working on the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>Sunday 8th January</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I went to buy a paper and put the Christmas decorations case in the loft. After lunch I did a little more research into a semiconductor flasher unit and later in the afternoon we spoke to both Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 9th January</p>
        <p>I was collected by Hamish this morning and taken to STEM Sussex in Brighton for a discussion on the 'wearable technology' workshop. We we got back he gave me some advice on my flasher unit design. After a very late lunch I went over to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. I also put his Christmas decorations back up in the loft. Meanwhile Angela held a church meeting here. After a reasonably early dinner I went to to the WSMGOC meeting, a talk by an Air Ambulance volunteer.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 10th January</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning researching components that might be suitable for the 'wearable technology' workshop, but without much success. After lunch Angela went to a WI committee meeting and I went to an RCEA talk. In between we put quite a few pieces into the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 11th January</p>
        <p>As usual Angela went to table tennis this afternoon. This was after she had walked to Beeding this morning. Meanwhile I did not go out at all! I tested the micro bit with three LEDs and worked out what bits would be needed. I also ordered a 12V 2-pin mechanical flasher unit, in case I can't get an electronic version to work, and I spent a lot of time working on the jigsaw.</p>
        <p>Thursday 12th January</p>
        <p>Anglea started by going down to the health centre to get new batteries for her hearing aids. We then went over to Dad's on our way to Holmebush to do the weekly shop. It was raining by the time we left and got worse during the rest of the afternoon. While Angela took shopping to Philip and Bay I tracked down the caterers at Falmer to check that the food had been ordered.</p>
        <p>Friday 13th January</p>
        <p>This morning I was the first to leave Kingsmead Close! Hamish collected me at 7:30 and drove us to Gatwick. Actually to the Sofitel hotel where the South East heat of the FIRST Lego League was held. There were eight teams from primary and secondary schools. By the time we left, just after 3:30, we were exhausted. Meanwhile, Angela took Bay to the chiropodist after lunch.</p>
        <p>Saturday 14th January</p>
        <p>We finished the jigsaw! Our day started as usual on a Saturday with a walk to the Beeding newsagents. Then I did the accounts while Angela started making marmalade. After lunch we worked on the jigsaw and then I experimented with my flasher unit. Adding a capacitor (plus diode and resistor) to create a false ground did not seem to work.</p>
        <p>Sunday 15th January</p>
        <p>It was a wet morning to go to the newsagents, but the umbrella helped. Meanwhile Angela took Philip to church. I then sorted out options for having a meal on Tuesday prior to the IET talk and cancelled five of the Worthing College student registrations. I also fitted the new flasher unit, but one side flashes faster than the other! This afternoon we spoke with Paul and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 16th January</p>
        <p>I went relatively early to Dads so tht I could get back in time for Angela to go to a funeral. She then went straight on to her WI meeting. Meanwhile I (over) cooked some lunch since, in the evening I went to an IET events sub-committee meeting at Bernard's. Hamish picked me up. I need to arrange two talks, one on the Rampion wind farm and one on AI.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 17th January</p>
        <p>I had decided that one of the off-side indicator lamps had failed, thus causing that side to flash twice as fast as the near side. However, both lights were still flashing! I had difficulty getting the front side light bulb (dual fillament, 21W/5W) back in. After filing the contacts to remove 'dimples' the flash rate was the same as the near side. Later I printed off the attendance list for the evening talk. Then I went off to meet Yang Gao at Falmer. Luckily she was early and we went off to the refectory for some dinner. Stangely, the caterer put the sandwiches and flasks on the desk at the front of the lecture theatre! The talk was well attended, but was not as detailed as I had hoped.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 18th January</p>
        <p>A cold day, with the frost staying around all day, in spite of the sunshine. I stayed indoors all day, although Angela went to table tennis. I spent a lot of the morning dealing with the aftermath of yesterday's IET talk. I emailed thanks to Yang Gao, sent attendance numbers to the IET and told Chris the food being set up in the lecture theatre. After lunch I ordered some electronic components from RS for experimenting with a flasher unit and produced another design. That will need two more MOSFETs (I had only ordered two) and if I want to try the RC network version I will need to get a couple of transistors from Maplin (RS only sell them in 10s or more).</p>
        <p>Thursday 19th January</p>
        <p>A cold shopping day. We collected Dad on the way to Holmebush, did the M&amp;S shopping, stopped for coffee, shopped in Tesco and then came home. After lunch Angela took shopping to Phillip and Bay. Meanwhile I dealt with IET expenses (or lack of them) and various other email.</p>
        <p>Friday 20th January</p>
        <p>It was a clear, bright, sunny day, but very cold. Just the day to go for a walk. So we went off this morning, after Angela had been down to Steyning, to Nymans gardens. We arrived in time for coffee, walked around trying to identify plants on their 'alphabet' list and then had lunch before coming home. This afternoon I emailed people about speakers for IET talks on the Rampion wind farm and on AI and I sent some thoughts on the wearable technology workshop to STEM Sussex. I also created a slideshow page with photos of the FFL.</p>
        <p>Saturday 21st January</p>
        <p>Another bright, sunny day, but one that felt even colder. We walked down to the Beeding newsagents after breakfast and Angela went down to the church this afternoon to help with a beetle drive, but otherwise stayed in the warm. I did the weekly accounts and then experimented with my flasher electronics. I made a timer circuit with a MOSFET work and then created a virtual ground using a capacitor, diode and resistor. It almost worked. the LED head a 50/50 duty cycle, but the bulbs only flashed briefly each cycle. The virtual ground oscillated between 6 and 7 volts above the true ground. Since the threshold voltage is between 2 and 4 volts I guess that the gate of the MOSFET is not staying low for long enough.</p>
        <p>Sunday 22nd January</p>
        <p>I took the walk to the newsagent in the cold this morning on my own, while Angela took Philip to church. I continued 'playing' with y indicator flasher design. I tried a larger resistor to see if I could lengthen the time that the capacitor takes to discharge. But that didn't work. I also realised that my alternative design will not work, since I had the n-channel MOSFET upside down. Later we spoke to Victoria and Paul (Rowan had been skating on the sloot).</p>
        <p>Monday 23rd Janaury</p>
        <p>I started the day at the doctor's surgery having the spot on my forearm frozen! Angela met me there and we went off to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. After lunch I spoke to Hamish (who is on a Greek island) about the micro:bit. I also added some more to my article on the SDR and started investigating flights to/from Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 24th January</p>
        <p>Another fine day. So we walked down the river to Shoreham airport for lunch. It took us two hours, longer than we expected. We caught the bus back! Before we went I finished my SDR article and sent it to the Main Gear editor and started sorting out the documents for Thursday's GoG meeting. This afternoon I uploaded them to the iPad and started reading them.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 25th Janaury</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning reviewing the documents for the GOG meeting tomorrow. It took quite a long time to get the updated documents on to the iPad. After lunch I revisited the Tiger Moth, reviewing again the motor that I should use. I then cut a new template for the motor plate.</p>
        <p>Thursday 26th January</p>
        <p>This morning I was woken by the alarm, after a somewhat disturbed night's sleep. I got to Moulescoombe at about 8:45 and went up to the eigth floor of the Cockroft building. I'd not been beyond the ground floor since it had been refitted. Unfortunately, most of the other members of the Gift Oversight Group did not turn up! So the chairman aborted the meeting and I spent some time giving feedback to Sam and Melissa. Consequently I was home early and so we went off to do the shopping before lunch. After a late lunch Angela took Philip his shopping and then we went to Bay's. I changed her oven lamp and investigated her anglepoise, bringing it home to repair.</p>
        <p>Friday 27th January</p>
        <p>Angela went down to Steyning and I walked to Beeding to get my hair cut. After lunch I took apart Bay's anglepois lamp and rewired the bulb holder, then started cutting out the motor plate for the Tiger Moth. Meanwhile, Angela went to help at a 'messy church' session.</p>
        <p>Saturday 28th January</p>
        <p>As usual, we both walked to Beeding this morning to buy a newspaper. Then Angela went to the library while I did the weekly accounts and did some more work on the Moth. After lunch we took Bay her repaired anglepois lamp and the frozen food we had forgotten to deliver on Thursday. When we got back I spent a lot of time doing a survey for the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
        <p>Sunday 29th January</p>
        <p>I got back from the newsagents this morning just as Angela was leaving to pick up Philip to take him to church. I then spent most of the morning and part of the afternoon working on the Moth. Later in the afternoon we spoke to Victoria and to Paul. Victoria told us about a new BA service from Gatwick to Oakland that is considerably cheaper than the flight to San Fansisco.</p>
        <p>Monday 30th January</p>
        <p>We went to Dad's quite early this morning so that Angela could catch the one o'clock bus to Storrington. We turned over his bed clothes and filled his pill box, theen got home for an early lunch. While Angela was at the bank, getting the WI signatures changed, I made the firewall for the Moth and epoxied it in place, along with a fillet between the firewall and the motor plate. I also emailed someone at Sussex University about an IET talk on AI. We heard from Victoria that they have book flights to arrive at Gatwick on Tuesday 18th April, leaving on May 8th.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 31st January</p>
        <p>A dreary, wet day. I spent a lot of the day working on the Moth. I organised the list of wood bought from SLEC so that I could identify the various pieces. The plan doesn't say what material is used for the front cowl, so it is balsa. However, I had bought obeche. So I started cutting the laminates for the front cowl, but I only produced two and cut the outline of a third. I also investigated flights to/from Amsterdam and sent details to V &amp; P. Angela did a combination of cleaning, washing and going down to Steyning.</p>
