        <p>Sunday 1st October</p>
<p>A less tiring day. I walked to the Beeding newsagents and then on to Hyde Square to get some milk, while Angela went to church. I then started cleaning the prop shaft prior to painting before we spoke to Paul and then finished cleaning it before we spoke to Victoria.</p>
<p>Monday 2nd October</p>
<p>The day started with a call from Dad while we were having our breakfast. It seems that the new carer had arrived at 7am, while he was still in bed! Angela then walked to Steyning before we went over to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. We also found that we can take him into the pharmacy to get his flu jab. When we got home I phoned Valarie Manor about respite care for Bay and then gave the prop shaft a coat of paint before lunch, with another one after lunch. During this time the manager at Valerie Manor call back, saying that they had a room for Bay. Afterwards we went to Bay's to collect the green chair that we had taken to her earlier. She had put the camping chair back in the kitchen!</p>
<p>Tuesday 3rd October</p>
<p>This morning Angela went off to Storrington (on the but, but got a lift there from a friend) to pay in her coffee morning money and go to Barclays. Meanwhile I emailed the Sussex LN committee members about the AGM. After an early lunch we took Bay to Valerie Manor. It took longer than usual to get her out of the house since her legs and shoulder are painful. We were not home until nearly 5:30 and I went off at six to the IET talk in Crawley. It was called 'How the Internet works', but was really only about the network layer. The speaker dived in to the detail with little help for those who did not know what goes around it.</p>
<p>Wednesday 4th October</p>
<p>This morning I started doing the monthly accounts while Angela was working on her WI accounts. I then went out for lunch with Simon Windust. I was back at about 2:15 and, after coffee, I went to the Nut &amp; Bolt Store to buy some new bolts for the prop shaft connection to the gearbox. However, they only had slightly shorter bolts. I then cut the front grass and the top lawn at the rear before Angela got home from table tennis. After an early dinner we walked to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Hidden Figures'. It was very good.</p>
<p>Thursday 5th October</p>
<p>Shopping as usual on a Thursday. We finished earlier than usual and so had our lunch at the usual time. Afterwards, while Angela took shopping to Bay's, I finished cutting the grass and then started re-installing the prop shaft. I got it in place and bolted one end to the differential.</p>
<p>Friday 6th October</p>
<p>Dad woke us this morning with a call, saying that a carer had arrived. He is still having difficulty accepting that they have not stopped. While Angela went to Steyning I entertained John and Hamish in order to hand over SLO details to John. After lunch I spoke to Touch of Care about moving the call to Dad back half an hour (after next week). I also confirmed the dates that Dad will be away. Then I booked a chiropodist appointment for him. Then I started connecting the prop shaft to the gearbox. After fitting two bolts I discovered that the two flanges are not rotationally symetric and I had them 90 degrees out! So I had to remove the bolts, rotate the prop shaft and refit the bolts. There are still two more to fit.</p>
<p>Saturday 7th October</p>
<p>An uneventful Saturday. As usual it started with a walk to Beeding to get a paper. We also arranged for Bay's papers to be delivered to Valerie Manor while she is there. When we got home I did the weekly accounts. A statement arrived later, so I did the reconciliation. Later in the afternoon I finished fitting the prop shaft to the gearbox. Angela wrote (on the computer) letters for Bay to send to her friends, telling them that she will be away for a while. I also experimented with producing a poster for an IET talk.</p>
<p>Sunday 8th October</p>
<p>A usual Sunday morning of Angela going to church and me walking to Beeding to buy a newspaper. Later in the morning, after backing up files, I made two 'caps' to go on the brake and clutch pedals so as to help fit the pedal draught excluder. After lunch I warmed the excluder, which is made of rubber, in hot water, coated the 'caps' and the inside of the excluder pedal holes with grease and managed to get the device over the pedals. I then fitted the excluder plate to hold the excluder to the floor. While the gearbox cover is off, I removed the gear lever top cover and spring, wire brushed them and put them in Deox to kill the rust. I will paint the cover before refitting it. We then spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
<p>Monday 9th October</p>
<p>As usual on Mondays we started by going over to Dad's. Apart from filling his pill box and 'turning over' his bed clothes, we took him to the chemist for a flu jab and gave in a repeat prescription. When we got home I gave the underside of the gear lever top cover a coat of paint. Then after lunch I did the same to the top. Later I repeated the process. For some reason the paint on the top dried quickly as usual, but the underside stayed tacky. During the afternoon I drafted the October Sussex LN newsletter. After an earlyish dinner I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington.</p>
<p>Tuesday 10th October</p>
<p>This morning I took the Panda to Simms for a service and MoT test. Angela went to Steyning and I went into Mel and Terry's to show them how to print from their iPads. Then I started refitting the top cover on the gearbox remote. I also fitted the clutch pedal rubber after heating it in hot water. Later I cut the carpet around the pedal excluder and fitted the gearbox cover while Angela went to a WI committee meeting. Then I walked back down to Steyning to collect the car.</p>
<p>Wednesday 11th October</p>
<p>The only car related activity today was to put the bits and pieces back in the Panda. However, we took Sam to the vet to see about her weeping eye. That turned out to be fine, but she had lost a lot of weight over the past month, her only kidney felt 'lumpy' and her teeth are in a bad state. The vet gave her an antibiotic injection, mainly for her teeth, which she would normally remove. She also gave us some samples of 'renal' food. We later did some research into the availablity of such food. As we came out of the vet's 'surgery' we found Phil from the cattery waiting with one of his own cats. Later I finished the IET October newsletter (apart from one image) and sent it to Bernard and John for review. I also updated Victoria about Sam.</p>
<p>Thursday 12th October</p>
<p>Shopping. Not quite so much this week since we are all running down as we approach our holiday. We then tried to find some renal food for Sam. We couldn't find any locally, so we ordered some online to collect tomorrow. After lunch I tried to find out what has happened to my hub and half shaft, but Pete was out of the office. So I had a haircut in Beeding while Angela took shopping to Philip and Bay.</p>
<p>Friday 13th October</p>
<p>A day without really achieving anything. This morning we had to take Bay to have a flue jab and see a physio about her hip options. After lunch we collected renal food for Sam from Lyons Farm and then took Bay back to the health centre to see a nurse about her legs. Earlier I spoke with Pete at the Octagon Club, but he had not yet received my hub and half shaft. When I spoke to Dad in the evening he asked why he had to go to the care home, when he could look after himself!</p>
<p>Saturday 14th October</p>
<p>After our walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper we walked to Steyning to have our flu jabs (and buy Dad a mop). The rest of the morning was spent printing off documents for our holiday and doing the weekly accounts. This afternoon, while Angela cleared things in the garden, I produced a report fo the IET Sussex LN AGM and then checked on routes and places to stay on our trip down the Californian coast.</p>
<p>Sunday 15th October</p>
<p>Today we started putting out things to pack. I started while Angela was at church and she did some this afternoon. I updated the laptop (linux and Windows, which took all morning, and then backed up some files. We spoke to Paul et al and the Victoria et al this afternoon. So overall, not a lot happened today.</p>
<p>Monday 16th October</p>
<p>This morning, while Angela walked to Steyning while I went to Dad's. We started putting out his clothes for packing. After lunch, Angela went to her WI meeting and John Berry called to pick up some equipment for Thursday's event at Worthing College. Later we took Sam to the vet. She was sick this morning and has not eaten since. The vet gave us CatMalt to help with Sam's constipation and some Recovery food that is lick a paste. We need to take her back in the morning for a blood test. We will then get the results in the evening. However, Sam doesn't seem to like either the CatMalt or the paste!</p>
<p>Tuesday 17th October</p>
<p>We started the day by taking Sam to the vet for a blood test and we ended the day taking Sam to the vet to be put to sleep! Not a good day. In between, I went to Dad's before lunch to help him pack, while Angela took the bus to Storrington to pay in her WI cash. After lunch Angela went to Bay's to help her pack while I replied to the TC owner who lives in Lancing. I sat most of the afternoon with Sam on my lap.</p>
<p>Wednesday 18th October</p>
<p>By the end of the day we are both exhausted and planning an early night. The morning went well. We went to Dad's, finished his packing, shut up his house and took him to Victoria Grand. When inside he seemed much happier than earlier, when just the thought of going into a care home for three weeks seemed to depress him. We settled him in his room, took a little tour and left him in the dining room ready to have his roast chicken dinner. Everyone ws very friendly (he was greeted at the front door with &quot;hello Jim&quot;) and the residents all seemed quite active. They were due to see a film this afternoon. We got home in time for lunch and then went to Bay's to repeat the process. However, this took much longer. We were home by about five packed our cases and eat a large meal, trying to finish off the food that we have left. Then showers and an early night.</p>
<p>Thursday 19th October</p>
<p>Up at six; collected by Russel at 7:45 and taken to Gatwick; Took off at 11:15 (scheduled departure was 10:40); landed at 10:05 in Oakland; took BART to Richmond (via Oakland Collusseum, where a football match was about to start) and then Amtrak to Davis; met by Victoria and Austin at 5:52 (1:52am UK time); pizza for supper (after two meals and a snack on the plane) and in bed by 8:30.</p>
<p>Friday 20th October</p>
<p>We slept quite well and got up at 6:30 to join the others for breakfast. We then walked Austin to school (actually to nursery before he goes to kindergarden in the afternoon). Victoria then cycled on with Juniper to pre-school while we walked home. The rest of the morning was then spent reading guides to California before Brandon came home and we went out to Woodland for lunch. On the way back they called into Costco before collecting Austin. A little later, while I was trying to help Austin with a Lego model, Brandon and Angela walked to collect Juniper.</p>
<p>Saturday 21st October</p>
<p>After a fairly disturbed night we did not get up until after 8am. After showers we had an early lunch and then went off to watch Austin play socccer. At least, one of his team (four 'red dragons') new what to do. The others just ran around and kicked the ball if they had a chance (in any direction). Needless to say, their opponents scored lots of goals. Later in the afternoon we walked to the nearest park, where Austn and Juniper played in the sand pit. She had a screaming session when it came to the time to leave! When we got home we played games before dinner.</p>
<p>Sunday 22nd October</p>
<p>It should have been a quiet day, taking gentle walks. We did walk to Savemart to buy a few things, but then the next door neighbour called to say that water was bubbling up on Victoria and Brandon's front and running along into his garden. Brandon turned off the water at the main stop tap at the front of their garden (so we had no water in the house) and the water stopped flowing. So we dug up part of the paving by the side gate and found that a T-joint in what we assume is part of the irrigation system plastic pipework had come apart. We could not find any stop tap, so Brandon bought a cap (and some plastic pipe glue) and we capped off the pipe. We had to wait two hours for the glue to cure, but then we again had water. Meanwhile, Austin had been to see a movie with one of his friends and his family, and Juniper had slept, following a short walk. With Brandon's help I set up Victoria's old iPhone, but the SIM card from my mobile is not the right size. I then discovered that my Pay As You Go type of contract had been taken off the market at the end of August and I could not log in! After dinner we packed for the morning and I 'lost' my glasses!</p>
<p>Monday 23rd October</p>
<p>We collected the hire car a little earlier than planned and so left Davis at 10am and stopped for lunch at Carsons Hill, just south of Angels Camp on highway 49. The road south of Courterville was quite a challenge, being steep and twisty, but we arrived at Cedar Lodge at 4:15, after 183 miles and 6 hours 15 minutes. Dinner was an unispiring afair in their 'fast food' grill.</p>
<p>Tuesday 24th October</p>
<p>We left for the park at about 10 o'clock, after having only a cup of coffee for breakfast. It took quite a while to get to the park entrance and then even longer to get to the valley.We started at the visitor centre and then had brunch at the deli. The process was to order your sandwich and coffee at a machine, wait for it to be prepared and tehn take it to the checkout and pay. It was another fine, warm (hot) day and so we sat outside. After lunch we took the shuttle bus to stop 16, Happy Isles, and walked to Vernal Falls bridge. This was marked as 0.8 miles, but it didn't say that most of it was at 20% going up! We decided not to go to the top of the falls (another 1.3 miles), so descended and walked around the Happy Isles before catching the shuttle back to the village, where we bought some food for supper in the store. It then took a long time to find a way to the car park, since all the roads around it had been re-surfaced! It took even longer to get out of the park. We were back at the motel just after 5pm.</p>
<p>Wednesday 25th October</p>
<p>We left the motel at about 8:45 and drove firstly to Tunnel View to take photos. It was a little misty. We then went to the Bridalvail Falls car park and walked up to the view point. Then we went off to Half Dome Village, which is mainly set up for campers, parked the car and caught the shuttle to Yosemite Village. We looked in the gallery and the book shop and then had lunch as yesterday. From there we walked to Lower Yosemite Falls and then caught the shuttle to the head of the path to Mirror Lake. Only a little of the lake was left at this time of year. We then caught the shuttle back to Yosemite village to buy food and then on to Half Dome Village to retrieve the car and drive back to the motel. We drove 82 miles on the two return journeys into the park.</p>
<p>Thursday 26th October</p>
<p>We left Cedar Lodge at 9:10 this morning, deciding to use a different route back to Davis so as to avoid the winding, steep road that we had travelled along on our journey to Yosemite. The route was boring by comparison, but took over an hour less travelling time. The most difficult part of the journey was ording some food in McDonalds at Atwater! Although I did find that I could get a phone signal. We got to Davis just after two, walked to Austins school (and back) and then returned the hire car before Victoria collected Juniper. After dinner, while Victoria and Austin went to a maths evening at his school, we played games with Juniper. Nevertheless, it was after nine before they were in bed! While they were eatingbedtime snacks and running around I viewed my 78 email messages.</p>
<p>Friday 27th October</p>
<p>Another fine and warm (hot) day. We had breakfast while Victoria took Austin and Juniper to school. Then we walked into Davis Downtown (about 45 minutes), started by picking up a map and but timetable and then had coffee. After finding the Post Office (which does not open until midday) we walked to University Mall so as to go to Trader Joes. After lunch we caught a bus, but only as far as the University campus. Then we walked back to the Post Office and then back to Victoria's. I had wanted to catch a bus, but our timing was out. When Victoria got back with Austin and Brandon arrived home, we all went to collect Juniper and drove to Woodland to a pizza place, before doing some food shopping in Costco.</p>
<p>Saturday 28th October</p>
<p>We all slept late this morning. Juniper was a little unwell, so went back to sleep while the rest of us (apart from Victoria) went to watch Austin play soccer. Their star player scored several goals and the match was about even, although most of Austin's team (the red dragons) stayed out of the way of the ball unless it came in their direction. Later, after lunch, we walked to a park, then, after dinner, playes the train game.</p>
<p>Sunday 29th October</p>
<p>Another quiet day, starting with a video call to Paul et al. After breakfast we took Austin and Juniper to a playground before lunch while Victoria did some cooking. Lunch was a large beefburger in a bun with salad and fries. After lunch we sat in the garden and the two children who live at the back came in to play with Austin and Juniper. It was warm, but nicely cooler than of recent.</p>
<p>Monday 30th October</p>
<p>After Victoria took Austin and Juniper to school she took us to the car hire depot where we collected a larger car than last week. At about 10:20 we set off on I80 towards San Francisco. We diverted off around the top of San Francisco Bay, stopping for coffee and to buy a couple of 'wraps', which we eat from the viewpoint overlooking the Golden Gate bridge. Having crossed the bridge we drove through western San Francisco and on down Highway 1 to half Moon Bay. We checked into 'Americas Best Value Inn' and walked around the area before going back a mile or two to eat.</p>
<p>Tuesday 31st October</p>
<p>Halloween. So every shop we went near had people dressed up. We left Half Moon Bay, calling into Safeway to buy something for lunch, and then headed in land to go to the Big Basin Redwood State Park. There were some fairly twisty roads, but the last part was very narrow for US-sized vehicles. We joined a guided tour of some of the redwoods, that started at 12:00, but did not finish until 1:30. The guide (a volunteer) was good, but it was quite slow going. However, we had an international group from Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and Parkistan (although now US), as well as us. After a late lunch we went for a short walk and then headed south to Monterey and found the Mariposa Inn &amp; Suites. From the road entrance it looked like a dump, but we were given a room with a separate lounge, on the third floor (US), so we could even see the Pacific Ocean (just) from our balcony. After a walk around the local shopping mall we went to the Crazy Horse restaurant (within easy walking distance) for dinner.</p>
