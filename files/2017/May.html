        <p>Monday 1st May</p>
        <p>Angela and I went to the craft and hobbies fair again, she to help prepare lunches and me to set up my display again. I then spent most of the day listening to people (mainly men, but also one woman talking about her husband) talking about building planes in their youth. It's a pity that it was drizzling heavily as I loaded the car. We then played with Austin and Juniper and had an early dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 2nd May</p>
        <p>Since we were at the craft and hobbies fair yesterday we started the day by going to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes and fill his pill box. We then went off to Worthing, parking on the prom, walking back to the pier for lunch and then walking up to the pirate playground. Later I went to Crawley for an IET talk on 'the internet of space'. It was interesting.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 3rd May</p>
        <p>We spent today at Fishers Farm Park, near Billingshurst. Although the weather was overcast, breezy and not very warm, it did not rain. Which was handy, since most of the attractions were outside. In fact it was a pretty good place and everyone enjoyed the day.</p>
        <p>Thursday 4th May</p>
        <p>Still tired after yesterday's exertions we did our weekly shopping today (as usual on a Thursday). Angela and Victoria (with Juniper) went off first and then Austin and I went to collect Dad. We had trouble meeting up (again), but got through the day. While the children were getting ready for bed we went to Bramber to vote in the local elections.</p>
        <p>Friday 5th May</p>
        <p>After Angela went to Steyning we all caught the bus to Henfield, where we had a drink and then caught the bus back. After lunch I mailed IET budget information to Roger and then cut the grass, front and back. During that, Brandon arrived home. After dinner Victoria fell ill and was sick. Also, Angela and I went down to Bramber to vote in the local elections.</p>
        <p>Saturday 6th May</p>
        <p>Victoria did not have a particularly good night and Juniper was awake and crying at various times. So we all had a disturbed night' sleep. Victoria went back to bed after breakfast and the rest of us drove down to Steyning. We left Brandon and the children in the playground and we bought some food and a paper. After lunch Angela and I walked the children down to the cricket field to the playground (which was really too old for them) and cooked dinner when we got back. So we were both pretty tired.</p>
        <p>Sunday 7th May</p>
        <p>Luckily Victoria was feeling back to normal this morning. So, while Angela took Philip to church, we started by visiting Dad and then went on to Bay's. In both cases for them to say goodbye. We had started lunch before Angela arrived home, but we got away just after one o'clock to go to the garden centre just the other side of Pulborough. The reason for going was so that Austin and Juniper could ride on the steam railway. They had four rides each, with the adults each having two. When we got back they packed most of their things ready for an early start in the morning.</p>
        <p>Monday 8th May</p>
        <p>We were up at six this morning and left for Gatwick at 7:30, arriving just before 8:30 so that they could catch thier flight at 10:25. According to the online departures board, the flight left on time. Meanwhile Angela went down to help with the lunch club. Just before I turned into Maudlin Lane I saw her walking down, but then found a note on the door saying that she had taken the spare door key in case I had forgotten mine, which I had. So I walked down to the church to collect the key, Helping Anita carry in her bags while there. Later in the morning I went over to Dad's to change his bed and put on his washing. I also filled his pill box and showed him photos of V et al's visit. I then had lunch with him before going to get some deisel for the hire car and looking at shoes. When Angela got home we took the hire car back to Littlehampton. After tea we went to the WSMGOC meeting. Someone gave a not very good talk about a holiday on the west coast of the USA, mainly around San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 9th May</p>
        <p>This morning I went to see Dr Jain about the mark on my arm and my sciatica. She prescribed me more ointment to rub into my skin, all over! She also gave me a form to 'self refer' for physiotherapy. I also had a blood sample taken. After lunch Angela went to a WI committee meeting and I checked over the TC in preparation for tomorrow's run and took it out to get some petrol.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 10th May</p>
        <p>This morning Angela went off to walk with her WI group and I drove to Horsham to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. After coffee about 28 cars (mostly MGs) set off for Loxwood via a circuitous route down some very narrow lanes. After lunch I came home along the same route that we used to go to Fishers Farm. In all I did 61 miles.</p>
        <p>Thursday 11th May</p>
        <p>Shopping day. We did the usual trip to Holmebush, first to M&amp;S, then coffee and finally Tesco. After lunch I talked to Roger about the IET budget and then walked to Beeding bridge to get my hair cut while Angela delivered shopping to Philip and Bay. I also cooked dinner. Later I reviewed the budget spreadsheet and sent Roger comments and additions.</p>
        <p>Friday 12th May</p>
        <p>It seems that today is 'Mass Observation' day. Since 1937 people have been recoding their diary for this day. The aim is to get a snapshot of the mundane at the same time each year. Angela started by walking down to the butchers. We then caught the bus to Worthing. It only runs on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from Henfield to Worthing and back, leaving Steyning at about 10 o'clock and arriving in Worthing at 10:45. It then leaves Worthing at one o'clock. We went to the bank to 'play' with their automated banking machines and then went for coffee in the 'Small Batch' coffee shop. It was good coffee, but a bit industrial. I then bought some shoes and we bought some trousers and jumper for Bay. This afternoon Angela helped at the 'messy church' session and I caught up with IET things.</p>
        <p>Saturday 13th May</p>
        <p>We feel as though we are still recovering from our visitors. We got up late and walked, as usual, to the Beeding newsagents. Angela then worked in the garden while I mailed Mike Wooldridge about the event in Bexhill next week and then did the weekly accounts. After lunch Angela did more work in the garden before taking Bay the clothes we bought her yesterday. Meanwhile I updated the IET slides, which took quite some time, and then downloaded photos and video clips from Google+ before preparing dinner.</p>
        <p>Sunday 14th May</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday, while Angela took Philip to church I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper and then updated the Linux and Windows systems. I also backed up files to the Data partition on the Linux laptop. After lunch I spent most of the afternoon putting together a video of V&amp;B's visit while Angela worked in the garden. I had problems with some photos appearing black, but only some. After dinner I discovered that by reducing their size it worked. Before dinner we spoke with firstly Paul and the Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 15th May</p>
        <p>This morning I went to Dad's as usual, but also because the mobile chiropodist was calling. All went well. He had washed his feet, but had not had a shower! We then had an early dinner so that Angela could go to her WI meeting. I updated my CPD records in Career Manager and prepared for the Sussex LN committee meeting, which I went to at the Hawth. I had offered to take Roger home, not realising that South Harting was near Petersfield! So I had a very long drive home from Crawley via South Harting.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 16th May</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning installing updates to both the iMac and the Macbook, while Angela caught the bus to Storrington to pay in her WI money. I also did some IET work. Later in the morning I started cutting the grass, finishing after lunch. Later still, Hamish brought the IET schools equipment and took me to Falmer for the the talk on cyber security in embedded systems.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 17th May</p>
        <p>An early start. Mike collected me at eight o'clock and we went to Bexhil College. We had two sessions, each with a stream of chidren, who built torches. The journey there and back was good, even if it was in Mike's Tourneo. I was home by about four.</p>
        <p>Thursday 18th May</p>
        <p>Shopping day. We took Dad to Holmebush, getting home just before one o'clock, which was quite early for shopping day. While Angela delivered the shopping to Philip and Bay I emailed people about next year's Egg Race and this years Guide/Scout event at Ardingly.</p>
        <p>Friday 19th May</p>
        <p>After Angela went down to Steyning we took some things to the tip in Shoreham (including two old duvets), called into Lidl to buy some plants and then went into Dunelm Mill to buy a new duvet for the spare bed. We then went on to Dad's for coffee and to cut his hedge, except that it started raining just before we got there. After lunchAngela did some housework and went in the greenhouse while I updated some files and built an electronic flasher. The latter worked sometimes!</p>
        <p>Saturday 20th May</p>
        <p>My day started with a drive to Crawley for the 'STEM in the Park' event, while Angela started by going to buy a newspaper. She then worked on the garden for the rest of the day while, with Manya, I set up the IET stall and built a load of torches from 11 o'clock. We had a few older students, but most were primary level and we nearly ran out of torch kits! We packed away our stall at four o'clock and I was home at ten past five. Luckily we had two tables since STEM Sussex moved one exhibitor out of our marquee.</p>
        <p>Sunday 21st May</p>
        <p>It was a day for recovering from the strains of yesterday, apart, that is, from the walk to the Beeding newsagents. While Angela was at church I did the accounts and made an inventory of the IET torch kits and literature. After lunch in the garden (it was a very fine day) I got the flasher circuit working with the buzzer and soldered the wire back on to the IET wind generator. We spoke with Paul and Rowan quite early, since they had to drive to Schiphol to collect Krista, who had visited friends in London for the weekend. We later talked with Victoria et al. Then I updated the IET school's web page.</p>
        <p>Monday 22nd May</p>
        <p>We took our usual trip to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box. However, today we also set out to cut his box hedge. During this, Di next door asked if we could trim back ivy on the fence. It took quite a bit of effort to cut it back. After a late lunch Angela went to Steyning and I met her at Bay's to check her kitchen light and look at her garden hose.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 23rd May</p>
        <p>After clearing some parts of the gutters I spent a lot of the morning reconciling my accounts spreadsheet with the bank statement and trying to find suitable ISAs. After an early lunch we took Bay to the dentist to have a loose tooth removed. Afterwards I finished the accounts and then temporarily installed my prototype flasher unit in the MG and tested it. It seems to work. I then joined Angela in the front garden, where I cut the front grass. Then back to ISA hunting. We need to find one into which we can transfer the existing ISA fund and another for a new fund, so as to keep below the protected sum.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 24th May</p>
        <p>It is debatable who did the most tiring activities. This morning Angela walked up to the South Downs Way and then along to Washington, with her WI friends. Then this afternoon she went to Camelia Botna for a cream tea! Whereas, this morning I cut the rear grass and then later this afternoon cut the box hedge at the bottom of the garden. In between I openned accounts with the Leeds and applied for ISAs, although they could verify Angela's identity online!</p>
        <p>Thursday 25th May</p>
        <p>Shopping day as usual. It was a very warm and sunny day and we seemed to have smaller lists this week, so were home earlier than usual. While Angela delivered the shopping I produced a stripboard version of the flasher unit. I also transferred birthday money into the accounts of Paul, Rowan and Austin.</p>
        <p>Friday 26th May</p>
        <p>We tried to organise an appointment at Nationwide in Worthing so that Angela could open an ISA and transfer her existing fund into it. However, their IT system was down until about 11 o'clock and we could only make an appointment for next Tuesday. So, after Angela went to Steyning and the library, we drove to Lancing Green, intent on having lunch at the new cafe on the beach (the Perch). However, their IT system was down and they were only serving hot drinks and cake! So we caught the bus into Worthing and had lunch at the Fish Factory. We then caught the bus back to Lancing Green and had coffee in the Perch. When we got home Angela went in the garden while I washed the IET table cloths and checked my design for the stripboard version of my flasher unit. I also mailed the guide leader about the International Camp.</p>
        <p>Saturday 27th May</p>
        <p>This morning, after walking down through the cows field, Angela went on to Bay's to deliver her washing and some shopping while I went on to the newsagents and then on to Bay's to test a new flourescent light starter (which struggled to light the tube). When we got home (and after coffee) Angela started work on hanging baskets and I cut a box bush under the 'pink' tree. While Angela continued in the garden after lunch, I started building my flasher unit for the MG. I cut the stripboard, cut the strips where required and soldered on the wire connectors. After an early dinner we walked to the Steyning Centre to see a performance of Faust by Heber Opera. I wasn't full of catchy tunes, but was well performed and was quite emotional at the end.</p>
        <p>Sunday 28th May</p>
        <p>A little longer walk to buy a newspaper this morning since the the Beeding newsagents had sold out! When I got home I did the weekly accounts and then continued building the flasher unit. By the end of the day I had built it and tested it. I now just need to fit it into the box. From 3 o'clock until 5:30 we spoke firstly to Paul and then to Victoria. After returning from church, Angela filled the hanging baskets and started filling the manger baskets.</p>
        <p>Monday 29th May</p>
        <p>Bank holiday Monday. I took Angela to the church wnere she spent the day helping to serve tea/coffee and cakes, since it was the Steyning Country Fair. I then went over to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes and fill his pill box. Then, after lunch, I took the TC to Hamish's where we ordered IET literature and torch kits for the remaining schools events. I could tell when the TC started (after many more turns than usual) that it was not running properly. It was vibrating more than usual and there was a distinct lack of power. I had to change down to get up quite small hills that the car would normally manage in its stride. I got home just before 5:30 and helped Angela cook.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 30th May</p>
        <p>We strated the day with a trip into Worthing that took the rest of the morning. Angela had an appointment at Nationwide to transfer her M&amp;S ISA into a 5-year fixed rate version. After that we had coffee, bought some plants in Wilko and then went to Morrisons to get a few items. By which time it was lunch time. Afterlunch Angela worked in teh garden while I cleaned the plugs and adjusted the points on the TC. It then started easily and sounded much better. I will need to keep them clean and take the head off during the winter. However, it was then time to take Bay to the dentist to have her modified denture fitted. They were running late and the whole episode took two hours. Lukily we had bought some pizza bases, so dinner did not take long to prepare and cook.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 31st May</p>
        <p>While Angela caught the bus to Shoreham with her WI walking friends and walked back to Barmber, I fitted my flasher circuit board into the plastic box and tested it on the bench. After lunch I fitted it into the TC and took the car for a drive to test both the flasher and the cleaned plugs. In the process I put 20 litres of petrol in the tank. It was a warm, sunny day, so I had the roof down and the side screens off. Later I started trimming the laurel bush by the back door while Angela continued working in the garden.</p>
