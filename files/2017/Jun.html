        <p>Thursday 1st June</p>
        <p>69 today! But it was also shopping day. Today, however, we did the M&amp;S shopping, followed by Dad's Tesco shopping before going on to Sainsbury's to do the supermarket shopping for the rest of us. So it was two o'clock before we got home. Therefore a late lunch. Afterwards, Angela took the shopping to Philip and to Bay while I unloaded compost and gravel from the car and tried to renew the insurance cover for the TC.</p>
        <p>Friday 2nd June</p>
        <p>Another fine day. Angela started by going down to Steyning while I transferred money from savings accounts to fund this year's ISAs. We then went, in the TC, to Highdown Gardens to have lunch in the cafe and then a quick walk around the garden. There was a short shower while we were eating, forcing me to go out and put up the hood, but otherwise it was fine. I took some 'agreed value' photos before we left and put the side screens back on. On the wy home we stopped to get some petrol for the mower and so later in the afternoon I cut the grass, front and back, while Angela did other work in the garden.</p>
        <p>Saturday 3rd June</p>
        <p>Rather than walk to Beeding to buy a newspaper, we went to Steyning so that we could also buy some ant powder for Bay. She had phone yesterday evening to say that she had ants in her kitchen. Whe we got there this morning the carer had found some ant powder in the shed and spread it around. We finished clearing out the ants and throwing away ant infested cake. Angela then worked in the garden while I did the weekly and monthly accounts. I then trimmed some more of the laurel bush and leveled a water but before writing up most of the details of the flasher unit for the TC.</p>
        <p>Sunday 4th June</p>
        <p>I walked to Beeding to buy a paper while Angela went to church. Then I worked on the Cub, repairing the rudder hinge and adjusting the control surfaces to remove any trims. I also enabled the throttle kill button. While Angela worked in the garden I started looking at fitting the battery in the glider. I will need to move the enable switch. We then spoke with Victoria et al and then with Paul and Rowan.</p>
        <p>Monday 5th June</p>
        <p>While I showered Angela went to Steyning. We then drove over to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. We also changed photos in one of his frames. After lunch Angela worked in the garden until it started raining. Meanwhile I progressed the Guide/Scout event, openned ISAs for Angela and I for this year's allowance and changed the connector on the ESC in the glider.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 6th June</p>
        <p>A windy and initially wet day. Angela managed to get out in the garden from mid morning, but I stayed inside all day. I wasted quite a lot of time trying to get a quote from Santander for house insurance. After two attempts at doing it online and a telphone call I was no closer. However, I did get an online quote from Saga and moved money into our new ISA accounts. Otherwise I finished installing the receiver and batery in the glider. I had to move the switch and then set up a new model in the transmitter (which was not intuitively obvious). I also adjusted the rudder so that it should not need any trim. So now both planes are ready (after battery charging) for flight.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 7th June</p>
        <p>With her WI walking freinds, Angela walked up to the South Downs Way this morning. I stayed home and got another (very high) quote for house insurance. The renewal notice also arrived. It has gone up 26%! Later I said that I would go to the HUBSEE Steering Group Meeting and bought train tickets for going to London. We also took Bay to the dentist (again) to have a broken tooth removed. I also updated my web pages on the TC, moving the 'flasher' page into the main list. Then, after and early dinner, we went to the Steyning Centre to see the film Sully. It was good.</p>
        <p>Thursday 8th June</p>
        <p>Shopping day finished reasonably early. After lunch we took Philip to vote in Bramber and then Angela took Bay's shopping to her. I started checking the parts in the oscilloscope kit.</p>
        <p>Friday 9th June</p>
        <p>We awoke to the news that we had a hung parliament. In other words, Mrs May had lost her majority, having called an election so as to substantially increase it. While Angela went to Steyning this morning I finished checking the parts of the oscilloscope kit and started removing the nails on the shed roof after the ridge strip of felt was blown off. After lunch we went to Shoreham to buy some new felt, then to get some oil and finally to get the shopping for the lunch club.</p>
        <p>Saturday 10th June</p>
        <p>Today is Bay's 102nd birthday! So after buying a newspaper we walked along the river to Bay's and spent the rest of the morning with her. After lunch Angela worked in the garden and I firstly stripped the felt off the roof of the lower shed and then nailed on the two main pieces. I still have to add more nails and put on the ridge pieces.</p>
        <p>Sunday 11th June</p>
        <p>After a walk to Beeding Bridge to buy a paper I bought the tickets for our trip to California in October/November, confirmed the booking for Sam at the cattery and then finished felting the shed roof. After lunch I added the wooden boards and then did the weekly accounts, including reconciling the bank statement. We then spoke with Victoria and with Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 12th June</p>
        <p>Firstly I dropped Angela at the church with her bowls of mouse and other stuff for the lunch club. Then, after a shower, I went over to Dad's. I turned over his bed clothes and filled his pill box as usual, but then called the fence man, but no answer. However, he phoned back and, since he was working in Sompting, called round to look at the fence. He will phone me with a quote. I also mixed up some paste and stuck bits of wallpaper back on the wall in the bathroom. After lunch I arranged house insurance for the coming year and got some quotes for travel insurance. I also sorted out the resistors for the oscilloscope. After tea we went to the WSMGOC meeting at Worthing Ruby Club. The speaker talked of her experiences in Jersey under German occupation.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 13th June</p>
        <p>After sending Evanna details of the Ardingly event in August I cut the front and rear grass (with lunch in the middle). I also charged the various batteries for the Cub and glider and replied to the fence man, asking him to go ahead with the work at Dad's. Later, just before four o'clock, I went up to the flying site. The grass was being cut and I found that I had forgotten my transmitter, so had to nip home for it. I had two flights (although Pim took off for the first). However, I didn't have the opportunity to try the glider.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 14th June</p>
        <p>Angela was not feeling too well this morning and so decided not to go walking. However, I set off in the MG to Borde Hill Gardens near Haywards Heath to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers and have coffee in the garden of the cafe. We then had a 25 mile run to Isfield in East Sussex for lunch at the Laughing Fish pub. Overall I drove 77 miles and got home by 3:30.</p>
        <p>Thursday 15th June</p>
        <p>Today our weekly shop involved a trip to both Holmebush and Lyons Farm. So it was quite late by the time that we got home. After a late lunch Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay. I managed to contact Matt at the IET and arranged for him to come to our next committee meeting. I also checked the TC's batery and cleaned the plug in teh fourth cylinder and started building my oscilloscope, soldering over half of the resistors to the circuit board.</p>
        <p>Friday 16th June</p>
        <p>We both had a busy day. I started by driving over to Moulsecoomb, to the STEM Sussex office, to pick up the equipment for the Energy Watch workshop. I then took the TC out, firstly to get some petrol at Beeding and then to Dial Post for the VSCC lunchtime gathering. I had lunch with Hamish and Sue and got home just before Angela went off to Bay's to take her to the chiropodist. She had already taken Bay's denture to the dentist to be modified. I then did some more soldering of components for the oscilloscope.</p>
        <p>Saturday 17th June</p>
        <p>Probably the hottest day of the year so far. We walked to the Beeding newsagents, through the field on the way there and up the lane (in the shade) on the way back. After dinner we took Bay to Nymans gardens for a 'wheel' around and then afternoon tea.</p>
        <p>Sunday 18th June</p>
        <p>Hotter than yesterday. So after a walk to the newsagents I stayed inside, replying to some email and then soldering more components on to the circuit board for the oscilloscope. While looking for information on how to put the case together I found a video of tips on building the oscilloscope. It suggested that I should take more care about static. Probably too late, but I will find my anti-static wrist strap! Paul et al were visiting Krista's cousin and a local beach. So we spoke to Victoria first.</p>
        <p>Monday 19th June</p>
        <p>On our way to Dad's we called into Sainsbury's to get a few items, including some flowers for Angela to tke to her WI meeting to use in a flower arranging demonstration. The guest speaker guided some volunteers through the process of making a flower arrangement. So we changed Dad's bed, filled his pill box and put on his washing. We had to leave early because I had an appointment at the dentist for a check-up. Luckily all was well. After lunch, while Angela was at her WI meeting, I finished building the oscilloscope. Today I used my home-made anti-static wrist band and luckily the oscilloscope worked. I now just need to get it into its case. I also looked at the slides for tomorrow's workshop and loaded the equipment into the car.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 20th June</p>
        <p>The alarm went off at six o'clock this morning! And I arrived at Davison School at eight, meeting Hamish in the car park. During the day we ran three one-hour Energy Watch workshops. I was home with the equipment by 3;30. There was still no MG insurance certificate, so I phoned the broker who said that they had not yet received it from the underwriter. He said that he would phone them and send me the documents when he received them.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 21st June</p>
        <p>The longests day. And the hottest June day since 1976! Angela was collected at twenty to nine and went off to a noutdoor play that took most of the day. The audience had to move locations from act to act and stopped for lunch in the middle. She got home at about five o'clock. Meanwhile I went off to Dad's to take him to his opticians appointment. His cataract is no worse than last year and his current glasses prescription is fine. That took most of the morning. After lunch I built the case around the oscilloscope. That took most of the afternoon. I had to file the bolt holes and glue a broken pice of acrylic to which the screen is bolted. Anyway, the scope still worked afterwards, even if the screen is not square.</p>
        <p>Thursday 22nd June</p>
        <p>Angela started the day by going down to the health centre to get batteries for her hearing aids. So we were a little later going to Dad's and on to do the weekly shop. As a consequence we started with coffee, but everything else was a little later than usual. After a late lunch Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay as usual. Meanwhile I bought travel insurance for our trip to California and started the process to set up my access to Adestra.</p>
        <p>Friday 23rd June</p>
        <p>Neither of us had anything planned for today. So While Angela went to Steyning I cleared out the gutters at the rear and the side and left messages for two tree men about getting quotes. When Angela returned I cut the front grass and cleared the weeds from the road gutter. Then I continued my research into using Time Machine and setting up an external drive for backups. After lunch I cut the rear grass while Angela worked in the garden. One of the tree men (Steve from Treedom) called and quoted &#163;320 to give the trees in the front a 'haircut' and remove the two Norway Spruces. This is less than we thought it would be. For dinner Angela cooked an interesting smoked haddock and cauliflower (and potato) gratin.</p>
        <p>Saturday 24th June</p>
        <p>After I went to Beeding to buy a newspaper, Angela went off to Polsden Lacy to meet up with Carol and June. She got back just after six. So I had a quiet day. I replied to Manya about BB SE, wrote to Ron in Connecticut and did more research on backing up the iMac.</p>
        <p>Sunday 25th June</p>
        <p>Not a very productive day. I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper, helping three people with directions on the way there and back. The bypass is still closed. Meanwhile, Angela gave Philip a lift to church. I then did some more research on making a Linux system act as a Time Machine server. After lunch we both did a little work in the garden until we spoke with Paul and then Victoria. My attempts to implement and configure SMB on the Elementary OS system did not suceed.</p>
        <p>Monday 26th June</p>
        <p>It started bright and got better as the day wore on. We started by going to Dad's to fill his pill box, turn over his bed clothes and put on some washing. We also collected his next set of pills from the chemist and tidied parts of his garden. After lunch Angela did some shredding in the garden and I measured the ignition timing on the TC, using Neil's strobe light. Cylinder one seems fine, but I got pecluliar results for the other cylinders. I also replaced the strip of wood in the base of the side screen box with a strip of kitchen floor covering. The side screens now fit in the box. I also arranged for Ed, the piano tuner, to come tomorrow and for the tree man (Simon) to come and trim the trees at the front and remove the two conifer trees.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 27th June</p>
        <p>Another less than productive day. Ed the piano tuner came just before lunch. It cost &#163;75! Meanwhile Angela walked to Steyning and I made notes on my ignition timing measurements. I also checked on the distributor model and measured the spindle. However, I didn't get any closer to understanding why i get the disperate measurements. I also used my oscilloscope to look at the output of an Arduino driving a servo. I could see the output changing from 1ms to 2ms as the servo was moved. A good result. During the day I prepared the equipment and documents for tomorrow's BBSE.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 28th June</p>
        <p>Up at five (after not much sleep), collected at six by Hamish and on site at Ardingly by 6:45, having picked up Mike on the way. We set up the IET stand, had a cup of coffee and I went off to the judges briefing. The rest of the morning was spent reviewing projects and giving feedback to the students. Then lunch, a walk around the site and then the awards ceremony. After that I halped the others pack up and I was home by 4:30. After an early dinner we walked down to Steyning to talk to electric car owners at the Star. However, we didn't go in for the 'discussion'.</p>
        <p>Thursday 29th June</p>
        <p>Angela was due to be picked up at one o'clock, so we had a slightly earlier start to our weekly shopping trip. After Holmebush we took Dad home and then went to Lyons Farm, since Angela had a voucher for Sainsbury's. Even so we were home just after midday. After lunch Angela went to the Prairies Garden, north of henfield and I emailed the people at Ricardo. After Angela had returned and delivered their shopping to Philip and Bay we took the TC to Binsted, near Arundel, for dinner and to meet up with members of the WSMGOC. We were home just before ten.</p>
        <p>Friday 30th June</p>
        <p>Angela went down to Steyning while I 'played' with the TC. I measured the ignition timing advance again and also measured the compression. Whereas before I turned the engine over by hand, five times, this time I used the starter motor. It took nearly 30 turns before the gauge reached its highest value! Whereas the timing between cylinders was still high, the compression was much closer to what it should be. After lunch I also checked the vacuum balance between the two carburettors using Neil's tool. They were well balanced. However, I tried reducing the richness of the mixture a little, particularly for the rear carburettor. I will see how it runs when I next take it out. I also replaced the rotor arm with a new 'red' one. Then I joined Angela in the garden and pruned the top of the laurel bush.</p>
