        <p>Wednesday 1st March</p>
        <p>I spent nearly all morning writing up the notes from yesterday's IET meeting, which I then sent off to Sathish, leaving him to put them into the template. After lunch I did some sums on our possible bid for the wood before receiving a call from Andrew Finch asking for my email adress so that he could send us the letter asking for a 'best &amp; final' offer for the wood. After dinner we met the other members of the group for a discussion on how we would proceed. When we got home, the letter had arrived!</p>
        <p>Thursday 2nd March.</p>
        <p>We were early starting our weekly shopping trip and did the usual round of Dad's, M&amp;S (shopping then coffee), Tesco and back to Dad's. After lunch, while Angela took shopping to Bay and Philip, I tried to track down suitable solicitors (three are du to call me back), reworked the calculations for purchasing the wood and started drafting an offer letter. I also refitted the alignment jig on the Moth. It now looks as though the tank parallel to the fuselage (and therefore the top wing will be at right angles), horizontal and at for degrees front to back. I now just need to work out how to fix the tank in place. After dinner I spoke with Alan.</p>
        <p>Friday 3rd March</p>
        <p>This morning I finished off my draft offer letter and sent it round. After an early lunch I took Angela and her various bags of stuff down to the church for her Women' World Day of Prayer. Since I had not heard from any of the solicitors I then tried calling the one in Storrington, only to find that they are closed on Friday afternoons! So I phoned the one in Steyning/Hove and he called me back. He also sent me details of what they could do and how much it would cost. I also glued the Moth's tank in place. After dinner I went to an SRFC meeting. It was a talk entitles '3D printing and how it can change your life'. But is was really about the sort of projects that a design company do. So I left at the interval.</p>
        <p>Saturday 4th March</p>
        <p>After our usual walk to to the Beeding newsagent I went over to John and Val's for a meeting of the wood group. Meanwhile Angela went to collect Dad. After the meeting we collected Philip and took them down to the church for the St Banabas Cottage Pie Lunch. Later in the afternoon I took Dad home and then did the week and monthly accounts and updated the offer letter according to the ammendments we had agreed in the morning.</p>
        <p>Sunday 5th March</p>
        <p>We were a little later up this morning than usual and so not quite so early going to get a paper. This was no bad thing since it had been raining earlier and I managed to stay dry. While Angela was at church I continued working on the tank for the Moth. I now just need to tidy it up and re-bind the bracing wires. After lunch I revised the offer letter for the wood and sent it round for review. We then spoke with Paul and Victoria. Brandon's telephone interview with a company in the Netherlands went well!</p>
        <p>Monday 6th March</p>
        <p>We did a little more this morning at Dad's than change his bed clothes, do his washing and fill his pill box. I'm not sure why we started it, but we cleared out his 'recycling' cupboard in the kitchen. There were things in it that were at least 11 years old! After lunch Angela caught the bus to henfield so as to pay in her WWDP money, while I finished tidying up the Moth's fuel tank and rebinding the bracing wires.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 7th March</p>
        <p>Progress on the Moth was slow today. I spent a lot of time making just two formers, gluing one in place, but then gluing and removing the other because it was not perpendicular to the longerons. I also did the final ammendments to the offer letter for the wood. Meanwhile, Angela went to Steyning and then spent most of the day working in the garden. Later, I went to an interesting IET talk on energy supply. But we were moved to the Spotlight room with only a TV, albeit a large one.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 8th March</p>
        <p>It was a slow day as far as the Moth is concerned. I sent the offer letter to Burts and got a call at 5:20pm to say that they were going with someone else! I also found out the timings for the 'little big bang' in Crawley so as to see if we would have time to get to the micro:bit training. And I emailed Derek about the TV in the Hawth room. Angela went to table tennis this afternoon while I made a new version of the front former out of ply (rather than balsa) and started re-making the second. These will be stronger so as to contain the battery, but the size of that battery will be limited.</p>
        <p>Thursday 9th March</p>
        <p>A busy day. We started by doing the weekly shop, collecting Dad on the way. We were quite late home. Then, while Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, I took the TC out for a run, going to Beeding to get some petrol and then on to Henfield. When I got back I put the car in the middle of the garage so as to start looking at the steering box.</p>
        <p>Friday 10th March</p>
        <p>I spent the morning sending email inconnection with IET schools events while Angela went to Steyning and the dentist. After lunch I put the front of the TC up on Axle stands and started loooking at the steering box. I decided that it would be too long a job to remove the drop arm and sector shaft. The splined connection between the two looked to be in good condition and clearly the sctor shaft had its top surface ground when the Tomkins Kit was added. There also seemed to be less than an inch play at the rim of the steering wheel. So I topped up the box with oil and adjusted the top bearing to take up a little slack.</p>
        <p>Saturday 11th March</p>
        <p>Another busy day! It wqs very grey and misty when we walked to Beeding to buy a paper this morning. We returned via Bay's, spending the rest of the morning moving her freezer and doing a few other odd jobs, including letting her listen to a CD produced by her nephew in Australia. After lunch Angela went to help at the 'messy church' while I did the weekly accounts, updated the IET Schools web page and worked on the TC. I checked the tightness of the front suspension and steering bolts and greased both. I also cleaned out an old grease gun, put in some water pump grease and gave the water pump a few strokes. Afterwards I cleared growing sychamore seedlings from the corner of the gutter at the back and tightened the inlet on a water butt.</p>
        <p>Sunday 12th March</p>
        <p>We were up later than usual and I walked to Beeding in a 'misle'. Luckily they had a paper left and also the missing sections from yesterday's paper. I then spent the rest of the morning cleaning the underside of the TC, adjusting the brakes on the way round. I completed the front, lowered it to the ground, jacked up the rear and cleaned one side. After lunch we went to Dad's to turn over his bed clothes and fill his pill box. We normally go on Mondays, but tomorrow I am helping at a 'slot trucks' event in Brighton. Later we spoke with Paul and then with Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 13th March</p>
        <p>A long and busy day. The alarm went off at six o'clock and I left for Brighton at 7:25. The traffic wasn't too bad and so I arrived at Moulescoomb at around eight. Most of the day was then spent helping at the slot trucks event. I got home at about four, having picked up the Energy Watch equipment. After tea we went to the WSMGOC meeting. It was supposed to be the AGM followed by a quiz, but the AGM took longer than expected and so the quiz was deferred to the next meeting.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 14th March</p>
        <p>The morning was fairly quiet. Angela went to Steyning while I completed the new ply formers for the Moth, took its photo and updated my 'process automation' slides. After lunch I went to Field Place, to the RCEA meeting and gave my talk. It seemed to go well and I got home about five. </p>
        <p>Wednesday 15th March</p>
        <p>Another busy and tiring day, but without going anywhere. I spent the morning in the garage working on the TC; just finishing cleaning, adjusting brakes and topping up oil. After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I serviced the mower, changing the oil, sharpening the blade and generally cleaning it up. Afterwards I cut the front grass.</p>
        <p>Thursday 16th March</p>
        <p>We took Dad to Holembush as usual to do the weekly shop, getting home at about 1:15. After lunch I walked down to Beeding to get my hair cut, but didn't, since they were closed. So I walked back. Hamish wasn't feeling well, so our planned review of the Energy Watch workshop did not happen. Consequently I checked the kit and then talked through the workshop with him via Facetime. Earlier in the week my right hand started hurting. It seems to be a strain of the tendons across the back of my hand and seems to be getting worse.</p>
        <p>Friday 17th March</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning this morning I started putting together a revised worksheet for solar power, finishing it later and sending it to Hamish for review. We then took the MG off to Dialpost to meet up with Hamish, Sue, Simon and June for lunch. There was quite a collection of cars parked outside the pub. When we got home Angela washed the Panda while I cut the back grass, before we walked down to the church for their quiz night and fish &amp; chip supper. We were joined by the Minister and his wife and our team won! This was probably due to his 8 out of 10 for the Bible round.</p>
        <p>Saturday 18th March</p>
        <p>We spent the morning in Worthing, having driven to Shoreham and then catching the 700 bus. I bought two multi-meters for the Energy Watch workshop. We also toured the charity shops and bought some jigsaws and a 'pop-up' tent. We were home in time for lunch. I spent part of the afternoon revising the solar power worksheet before we showered, changed and walked to the Tollgate for the WSMGOC annual dinner. It was a good evening. We didn't leave there until 11 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Sunday 19th March</p>
        <p>A quieter day. While Angela took Philip to church I walked to the Beeding newsagent. I spent the rest of the day either reading the paper or updating the slide deck for the Energy Watch workshop. Later in the afternoon we spoke to Victoria and to Paul.</p>
        <p>Monday 20th March</p>
        <p>After our usual visit to Dad's to change his bed, put on his washing and fill his pill box I completed a draft of an article for Main Gear. Angela went to her WI meeting after lunch and I updated my 'outings' page on the TC site and did a little more to the Moth (just a little). In parallel I updated the EOS and Windows 10 software.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 21st March</p>
        <p>Angela had a really busy day. She did three lots of washing, caught the bus to Storrington to pay in the WI cash, did some shopping in Steyning on the way back and then worked in the garden before doing some ironing! By comparison I did little. I printed the sheets for tomorrow's workshop (and some maps) and glued together parts of the fuselage between the cockpits. But the pieces moved while I was gluing them! Then Hamish called to go through the slides for tomorrow. We also assembled the desk fans. I also tidied my article on 'maintenance' and sent it to Roger for Main Gear. After dinner we gave Sam her flea treatment.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 22nd March</p>
        <p>A long day. One that required getting up at six o'clock and being picked up at 7:30. Hamish then drove me to Crawley for a 'kittle big bang' event. We did three workshops instead of the planned four. From there we went to another school in Horsham for a meeting between teachers and STEM Ambassadors on the micro:bit. I got home at six o'clock.</p>
        <p>Thursday 23rd March</p>
        <p>This morning, before going to Dad's, we went into Worthing, to the Majestic wine shop so as to use the Barclays reward. Unfortunately, they did not open until 10 o'clock, so we walked over to Morrisons to have a coffee and buy Bay's flowers. When we returned to the wine shop we were gived a &#163;12.99 bottle of Proseco. We then went to Dad's and on to Holmebush to shop in M&amp;S and then Tesco, having more coffee in between. We did not get home until 1:30. After lunch Angela took the shopping to Phillip and I went to have my haircut in Beeding. Angela then went to Bay's and I cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 24th March</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning and helped Sandy with her flower arrangements I tidied the eqipment and documents used in the workshops and tried to fid out why one of the meters would not work on some voltage ranges. I also continued making and fitting formers to the Moth (well, I made and fitted one former) and started looking at the GOG documents for Monday's meetng. After lunch we went into Worthing to collect the cat fountain. I also bought another meter and Angela bought a Mary Berry cook book. We then went on to Rogers Farm gardeb centre, where Angela biught some 'plug plants'.</p>
        <p>Saturday 25th March</p>
        <p>Angela was very busy today. After our usual walk to the Beeding newsagents she took down the long curtain in our bedroom and washed it (and the lining) along with the bathroom curtains. Later they were ironed and put back. While I did the weekly accounts and tried to clean the mold from the door and window frames in our bedroom she worked in the garden, cleaning the glass in the greenhouse in the afternoon. I repaired the shed gutter outlet and cleaned out the gutters on the shed and greenhouse. I also made and fixed the remaining formers on the top of the Moth's fuselage and read about security on Macs to see if I needed to do anything.</p>
        <p>Sunday 26th March</p>
        <p>While I walked to the newsagents in Beeding, Angela took Phillip to church. During the rest of the day I finished fitting the stringers to the fuselage of the Moth and updated the web page. I also found that the inability to connect the Elementary OS system to the Macs is due to a fault in the Files application. I installed a different file manager (Nautilus) and was able to connect. During the afternoon we spoke with Paul and then with Victoria. It seems that the company in the Netherlands want to arrange a face-to-face interview with Brandon!</p>
        <p>Monday 27th March</p>
        <p>This morning I went to the GOG meeting at Brighton. It finished early, so I returned the the Energy Watch equipment to STEM Sussex before coming home. It waas a fine, sunny day and so after lunch we took the MG to Dad's. As well as the usural pill box and bed clothes tasks we did some gardening. Angela pruned the hydrangea in the front and then a buddleia in the rear. I pruned another bush and we picked some rhubarb for dinner.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 28th March</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time this morning trying to get the newly installed Nautilus (file manager) application on EOS to appear within the application menu. I failed, but was able to add it to the dock. So over the course of the rest of the day I copied the contents of my Google Drive to the laptop. I now need to export photos and update the backups. After lunch I also cut the front and rear grass, while Angela continued to work in the garden. She put a lot of compost fromthe bins on to the raised bed and the other vegetable bed and tidied up other areas. I also sheeted a small part of the the Moth's fuselage.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 29th March</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day exporting photos from Photos on the iMac and copying them to the laptop. I also organised the exported images into folders. In between I started making the piece of sheeting that fits around the stays under the fuel tank. Before going to table tennis, Angela called on Bay to collect her letter about the blue badge. However, she had not read the letter properly! It is not yet available and she needs to collect it in person.</p>
        <p>Thursday 30th March</p>
        <p>Angela started the day by going to the health centre to get batteries for her hearing aids. Meanwhile I checked over the Panda in preparation for our journey tomorrow. Then we went to Dad's and on to M&amp;S and Tesco, starting with coffee! After lunch, while Angela took the shopping to Philip and Bay, I washed the Panda, did the weekly accounts and cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 31st March</p>
        <p>We left the cattery at 9:30 this morning after dropping off Sam and arrived in Badby at 12:45. This was after a slightly longer stop for coffee than we had anticipated due to a somewhat chaotic coffee shop. After a long lunch Dick drove us to Daventry to see a free film that Kate had signed us up for. It was an animation aimed at 7-8 year olds!</p>
