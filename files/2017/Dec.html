        <p>Friday 1st December</p>
        <p>A busy day doing lots of small things, in spite of my cold/cough still being bad. I started by going to Dad's to meet an estate agent. After lunch Angela went to the doctors and then on to visit Bay. I did a variety of emails.</p>
        <p>Saturday 2nd December</p>
        <p>Mainly a day of moping about with my cold and cough. Angela was busy as usual. I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Sunday 3rd December</p>
        <p>Another quite day. I completed the monthly accounts while Angela went to church. Later we spoke to Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 4th December</p>
        <p>A not so quiet day. We started by going to Dad's to change his bed, do his washing and fill his pill box. Also, Di and Eddie came in to witness Dad signing his Lasting Power of Atorney form. On the way back we called into Currys and found that they had been phoning the wrong number to tell us that our iMac had arrived. After lunch Angela went to visit Bay, who slept right through her visit. Meanwhile, I arranged the Panda insurance and sent a couple of emails. Then I opened the iMac box and put it together, i.e. plugged it in. I created our two accounts and set up our email, having earlier made a list of things to do.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 5th December</p>
        <p>This morning I took Dad to his surgery for his Annual Review. However, only a 'blood sample' slot had been booked, so the nurse could not do the full review! I brought home some more clothes for labelling! Meanwhile, Angela went to Steyning. After lunch Angela went shopping for boots before visiting Bay and I started moving files to the new iMac. I found that the Migration Assistant wanted to create the user accounts that are on the old machine and then copy everything across. Actually you could select, but only at a very high level. So I decided to do it manually and started with photos, which seems to have worked. I also started putting together my 'Christmas letter' for this year, but spent most of the time trying to find out what we have been doing!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 6th December</p>
        <p>Angela was out for a lot of the day; to Steyning, to table tennis and to visit Bay. Meanwhile I caught up with email and continued moving things over to the new iMac.</p>
        <p>Thursday 7th December</p>
        <p>A much busier day today. Dad decided not to join us on our shopping trip since he felt a little 'wobbly'. Later the weather turned wet and windy, so it was a good choice. After lunch Angela went off to visit Bay. Shortly after she left, the Christmas tree was delivered. So I cut a piece off the bottom and stood it in a bucket of water in the garage. Then I fixed the guttering on the bottom shed before putting the TC up on axle stands. Now I can inspect the work that I did on it after the short test run that I did a couple of weeks ago. I then did a little more tidying/sorting files on the old iMac.</p>
        <p>Friday 8th December</p>
        <p>Another busy day. Angela went to the dentist for a checkup while I went in the garage to check the MG. I removed both rear wheels and brake drums to inspect the shoes and then checked the tightness of the bolts at both ends of the prop shaft. Finally I adjusted the brakes. In the process I noticed some slight rotational movement on the near-side wheel. I swapped the front wheels and it moved to the off-side. So it seems to be worn splines in the wheel. I will try the spare to see if it is better. After lunch I took the TC to Dad's, to help him carry his cake and magazines to his club. It was his last attendance. It was a fine, sunny day and so I had the hood down. I got back before Angela left for her doctor's appointment (to have wax removed from her ears) and visit to Bay (who was asleep). I also did a little more tidying of files and copied some across to the new iMac.</p>
        <p>Saturday 9th December</p>
        <p>Angela was not down to help with the (Christmas) lunch club, but ended up ordering, collecting and cooking the turkey (breast). So we started by taking other things to the church, followed by a trip to the butchers and then back to the church to put the turkey in the oven. Angela stayed until it was cooked, while I went home and wrote my Christmas letters. After lunch we returned to the church and I sliced the meat using the electric slicer. There was no need for Angela to visit Bay since her friends from Liegh were visiting. In the evening I drafted my IET newsletter for December.</p>
        <p>Sunday 10th December</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church, I did the weekly accounts, checked, ammended and submitted my IET newsletter and wrote my Christmas cards. After lunch Angela dropped me at Dad's while she went on to visit Bay, who had been moved into a single room and was a lot better. I packed Dad's clothes for tomorrow's move and started helping him write his Christmas cards. When we got home we spoke to Paul (who had snow and had helped Rowan buid a snowman) and Victoria.</p>
        <p>Monday 11th December</p>
        <p>A very busy day. Angela left home first to help at the lunch club. She didn't get home until 3:30! I got to Dad's at about 9:30 and stated packing his remaining things, before collecting his prescription and paper. Alan and Chris arrived half an hour later. We got Dad to Victoria Grand by 11:30. His room is good, so we unpacked his things before he went to lunch. However, the room had not been prepared. Alan and Chris went back after lunch to take him his chair. When Angela got home we went to visit Bay. They are trying to treat her psychosis as well as managing her pain and treating her infection. She was quite incoherent today, having been better yesterday. Angela went to her WI committee meeting as soon as we got home. A little later I went to the WSMGOC Christmas meet.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 12th December</p>
        <p>It was a very cold start to the day. We had to be at Dad's by 9 o'clock so that the care line could be collected. We decided to take the main roads, but there was a stationary line of traffic down Clays Hill. So we turned around and went down a very icy Annington Road. We had a call from the person collecting the call line (who was early) and we were only a couple of minutes late. We then cleared out Dad's fridge/freezer before going on to visit him at Victoria Grand. When we got there, Norman was in his room chatting. We went to buy him a paper (his will be delivered from tomorrow), but they were still chatting. So we left them to it. When we got home Angela went to Steyning and delivered calendar. After a late lunch she went to visit Bay, who was asleep. I reworked the December newsletter and sent it to Bernard and John fro review. Later I spoke with Keith Thrower about a joint event in May.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 13th December</p>
        <p>Warmer today, but wet. And busy. We started by meeting the Sussex Wanderers at the Orchard cafe near Buckbarn on the A272. After coffee we followed the 27-mile route to the Red Lion in Ashington for lunch, which was good. We then went into Worthing to visit Bay. She was still psychotic. When we got home I went off again to Falmer for an IET talk on smart meters.</p>
        <p>Thursday 14th December</p>
        <p>We started by going over to Dad's before going to the Range warehouse and then on to Victoria Grand. Triffic was bad everywhere due to some temporary traffic lights on the A27. We got Dad to finish writing his Christmas cards before we went on to Sainsbury's to have some lunch and then did our weekly shop. From there we went to visit Bay in hospital. She was much more lucid today. She was being taken for a CT scan, so we left, getting home about 5:30.</p>
        <p>Friday 15th December</p>
        <p>Angela left the house first this morning, heading for Bay's and then Steyning. I 'ran into her' when I walked down to post the Lasting Power of Attorney form. I then went on to have a haircut, since I had missed Sue yesterday. He was very slow, but the result was fine. After lunch Angela went to to collect her WI programmes from the school and then went on to visit Bay. I got the Christmas decorations from the loft, installed the final applications on the new iMac paid Dad's carer's bill. Later, when Angela was home, I started putting photos into Dad's picture frame.</p>
        <p>Saturday 16th December</p>
        <p>We started by walking to the Beeding newsagents and then on to Bay's. Then I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling the bnk statement while Angela did some cleaning. After lunch, while Angela went to visit Bay, I brought the Christmas tree into the sitting room. Then I loaded the GOG documents on to the iPad and started reading them.</p>
        <p>Sunday 17th December</p>
        <p>Today I've only been outside to get the car out of the garage and then put it back. Angela went to church and then, after lunch, went to visit Bay in hospital. I started by putting up some lights in the porch and on to the tree. I did some file backups and finished putting photos into Dad's frame. Later I completed the Attendance Allowance form for Dad and printed the 30 pages. When Angela got home she added the other decorations to the tree and we spoke with both Rowan and Austin.</p>
        <p>Monday 18th December</p>
        <p>This morning I went off to visit Dad (via Berriedale Drive) while Angela went to Steyning. I took Dad's new photo frame and put it on the wall, moving some other paintings. After lunch, Angela went to her WI meeting and I went to a Gift Oversight Group meeting at Brighton. It finished early, so I was home before five o'clock, just after Angela. While Angela sorted out her WI cash, I cooked dinner; actually just heated a steak and kidney pie that Angela bought in Steyning and cooked some vegetables. We then went to visit Bay. She was faily lucid today.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 19th December</p>
        <p>We didn't particularly hurry this morning, so it was 11 o'clock before we had driven to Shoreham and taken the bus into Worthing. Angela banked her WI cash and then we had coffee before buying things in a toy shop and looking in various other shops. We had lunch in M&amp;S and then went to visit Bay. She was sitting in a chair today and was quite lucid. We then bought her a bed jacket and some frozen items for Christmas before getting the bus back to Shoreham. We were home at about five.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 20th December</p>
        <p>Not quite the day that we had planned. Almost, but not quite. The morning was spent doing jobs, cleaning by Angela, answering email and wrapping presents by me. After lunch we went to Dad's to find that his boiler needs pressurising. I then dropped Angela near the hospital and I went on to collect Dad to take him to his dermatology appointment at Southlands. The plan was that Angela would catch the bus to Victoria Grand, which she did. But as we left Southlands, Dad felt unwell. He was no better by the time we got into Worthing, so I took him to A&amp;E. They decided to keep him in overnight as a precaution, but could not really find out what was wrong. We arrived home just before eight, with fish and chips.</p>
        <p>Thursday 21st December</p>
        <p>Mid winter's day. We started by doing our supemarket shopping. Then we went to visit Dad and Bay in Worthing hospital. Dad has a chest infection, but should be discharged on Christmas Eve. Bay was fairly coherent today and they are planning to get her walking reliably by the 29th. It was lunch-time, so we were able to get away and came home for a late lunch. I then went to the hygienist while Angela cooked. When I got home I finished wrapping the presents. Angela heard that Philip had died in St Barnabas Hospice.</p>
        <p>Friday 22nd December</p>
        <p>This morning we went to Victoria Grand to collect some clean clothes for Dad before visiting him in hospital. He is likely to come out tomorrow. We then visited Bay in another wing before coming home for a late lunch. She was coherent, but was tired and seemed to be slightly slurring her speach. After lunch I drove to Gatwick to collect Paul et al. Their plane was a little late and they took a long time to get through imigration, so I was witing just over an hour. The car park cost &#163;12! We got home at about six o'clock.</p>
        <p>Saturday 23rd December</p>
        <p>A dissapointing day. We had expected Dad to be discharged, but a blood test showed some other problems. As a result, he had been given intravenous antibiotics. This means that he needs to be on oral antibiotics for at least 24 hours and so cannot be discharged, probably until the 27th! Meanwhile, Bay had taken a downward turn. She was able to stand up, but was rambling. Otherwise we helped Rowan make tree decorations. we also started the 'underground map' jigsaw.</p>
        <p>Sunday 24th December</p>
        <p>Christmas Eve. Angela went to church this morning, then after lunch (of cheese again) we went to Berriedale Drive, where I found that the boiler seems to be leaking! We then went on to Victoria Grand to pick up some clean clothes for Dad before visiting Bay and him in hospital. Bay was a little confused and Dad was bored. He is on oral antibiotics, which should finish on Boxingday. So he may be discharged the following day. When we got home Angela helped Rowan make some reindeer cup cakes before dinner (which we ate for desert). After dinner we had a quick call with Victoria, who are now in Missouri. Then, when Rowan was asleep, we did a little more to the puzzle (down to just the white pieces).</p>
        <p>Monday 25th December</p>
        <p>Christmas Day. We had a phone call this morning at eight o'clock from a doctor at the hospital to say that Dad could go home at ten. So I went to collect him and took him to Victoria Grand. Meanwhile Angela cooked an excellent Christmas lunch. We left the washing up and all went off to visit Bay in hospital. Unfortunately she was reluctant to open her eyes. So we went on to visit Dad. That was more successful, we even managed a FaceTime call (using the iPhone) with Victoria et al in Missouri. We got home at about 5:15, played some games with Rowan and had supper (more cheese).</p>
        <p>Tuesday 26th December</p>
        <p>Boxing Day. We decided to try visiting Bay again. So we all went into Worthing; Paul, Krist and Rowan walked to the beach and we walked to the hospital. Unfortunately Bay was sound asleep and could not be roused. She is awake all night and then sleeping all day! The day had started sunny, but it started to rain as we left the hospital. So we came home, via Berriedale Drive. The boiler is leaking, so I turned it off. After lunch we played games and then Angela cooked turkey curry and magic lemon pudding for dinner.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 27th December</p>
        <p>After an early lunch we set off for the Pavillion Theatre, where we dropped Angela, Krista and Rowan so that they could see the pantomine. Paul and I then went on to Victoria Grand and spent some time with Dad. Whilst there I had a call from one of the doctors looking after Bay. She explained that Bay had 'hospital induced pneumonia' and so was being given intravenous antibiotics and fluids. Normally people recover within 48 hours. If Bay doesn't then the prognosis is not good. We found out later that her friend from Leigh had visited her today, but Bay was not really conscious. Paul and I left Dad at about three and went into Worthing before meeting the others as they came out of the Pavillion. They had a good time.</p>
        <p>Thursday 28th December</p>
        <p>Angela walked down to Steyning this morning before we went off to visit Bay in hospital. To our surprise she was awake, alert and talking very coherently. It was a fine, but cold sunny day, so after lunch we all went into Worthing so that Rowan could go to the playground near the swimming pool while it was still light. We then went to visit Bay. Again she was on good form. we were home by about 5:30.</p>
        <p>Friday 29th December</p>
        <p>The morning was spent quietly until it was time to take Paul et al to Gatwick. In spite of a jam on the M23 just before reaching the Gatwick turn (due to an accident further north) we got to the airport at ten past one, giving them time to drop their bags and have lunch. After a late lunch we went to visit Bay. The nurses were dressing her legs when we arrived. When we got to see her she was almost as good as yesterday; her speach being just slightly slurred and her memory a little more flakey. We were home just after five. It is qiet without Rowan!</p>
        <p>Saturday 30th December</p>
        <p>We had an early night last night, but still managed to get up late. When we were finally ready we walked to Bay's (replacing batteries in smoke detectors with, what we suspect are drained batteries!) before walking on to the High Street to buy some meat. We then drove to Dad's, where I phoned his house insurance company to organise 'uninhabited' cover for his house when the insurance renews in January. That was follwed by a trip to the hospital. Bay was asleep when we arrived and didn't seem inclined to wake. So we went to the entrance and had a sandwich for lunch before returning. This time she was awake, since her lunch had arrived. We only stopped for a short while, since the street parking time was running out. When we got home Anglea cooked and I replaced the broken curtain track brackets in the back spare room and then did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Sunday 31st December</p>
        <p>New Year's Eve. Agnela went to church and then, after lunch, went to visit Bay in hospital. Bay was confused today. Meanwhile, I caught up with tasks and email. When Angela got home we spoke with Paul and then later with Victoria (who is still in Missouri where it is well below zero degrees C).</p>
