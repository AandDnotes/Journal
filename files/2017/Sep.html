        <p>Friday 1st September</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I started the day by taking Dad to Southlands hospital to get his wrist x-ray'd. We arrived there at 10:45 and were in the cafe after about an hour, having found that he did not have any fractures. This afternoon Angela did a lot of shredding and I cut the rear grass.</p>
        <p>Saturday 2nd September</p>
        <p>We set off early this morning to firstly visit Dad (and get his paper) and then drive to Beaulieu. It took us two hours to get there, with us arriving just after eleven. We had to part in a field a long way from the entrance. After a coffee we went to Roger Furneaux's stall, but he didn't have most of the parts that I wanted. So I only bought the hub nuts (with built-in seals) and a socket to fit them, but he forgot to bring the adapter! So we went to the Octagon Club stand. They didn't have the hub either, but I bought the rest of the bits. I must phone them to order the hub and half shaft, which will be pressed together by the manufacturer. We then had a picnic lunch before touring the house, gardens and motor museum. We left at 3:45 by the back exit and got home at 5:30.</p>
        <p>Sunday 3rd September</p>
        <p>We had an early start, arriving at Whiteways Lodge at 8 o'clock to help prepare for the start of the South Downs Run. It was quite hectic when the MGs really started arriving. We left at 11:30, in the rain, and went on to Dad's, getting home for lunch. I then spent a lot of the afternoon doing the weekly and monthly accounts, although we did speak with Paul et al.</p>
        <p>Monday 4th September</p>
        <p>We started by making our usual visit to Dad. The carer was still there and he was just finishing a shower! When he was dressed we changed his bed, put on two lots of washing and filled his pill box. Angela also bought his paper and sandwich and collected his pills from the chemist. We then came home, put Sam in the cat carrier and took her to the vet to be weighed, which had not changed. After lunch I went back to Dad's to talk with the ocupational therapist. The first man's list of equipment seems to be irrelevant! However, she is now ordering them and will review Dad again in a week. From there I filled the car with petrol, and bought the socket adapter and windscreen wiper blades from Halfords before going to Screwfix to buy some spring washers. I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to produce the first IET Sussex LN newsletter using Adestra. But I had email Julie with some questions.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 5th September</p>
        <p>It seemed to drizzle for most of the day, but was still quite warm. I spent a lot of the day failing to refit the differential in the back axle of the TC. It is just too heavy to manouvre into position either from below (while on my back I can't lift it off the floor) or from above (I have to lean out too far to ba able to support it). This morning Angela went to Steyning while I booked the two hire cars in California (and struggled with the differential) and this afternoon she went to the garden centre while I carried on struggling. She also did a bit of re-seeding of the grass in the front.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 6th September</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking with her WI group I ordered the hub and half shaft for the TC. Pete Moore called me later to say that the manufacturer, who will press the two together, says it will take three weeks. Then I went over to Dad's, primarily to collect some bricks. However, I also bought him a paper and a sandwich. When I got back I modified my IET newsletter and submitted it for approval. After lunch and while Angela went to a meeting, I built a platform under the rear axle from bricks and wooden planks. I then lowered the differential on to this platform, but I still could not reach it so as to manouver it into position. However, by removing the top of the luggage rack I could reach the differential and easily got it on to the studs. I tightened the nuts and started bolting the dif to the prop shaft. We had an early dinner and then went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Viceroy's House'. It did not paint a good picture of GB.</p>
        <p>Thursday 7th September</p>
        <p>The day started with a call from Dad to say that he did not feel well. So after breakfast we went over and gave him some poridge. The carer arrived just before we left to do the shopping. He looked a lot better and was helped to have a shower. After a late lunch Angela took Philip his shopping and I went for a haircut. While Angela was taking Bay her shopping I finished bolting the prop shaft to the diff. I then refitted the top of the luggage rack. After dinner I booked a hotel near Yosemite.</p>
        <p>Friday 8th September</p>
        <p>I spent most of the day at Dad's. We arrived at about nine o'clock and Angela went off on the bus to Worthing after I bought his paper and a sandwich. The carer arrived and helped him shower. Then the man arrived, just before eleven, with equipment and handles. He had installed them within 15 minutes. We had taken our lunch. Afterwards I walked Dad down to his club and Angela went off to do her lunch club shopping. She arrived back just as I was walking back with Dad. While he was out I phoned a number of care homes about respite care, but only found one that could take Dad while we are away. Later in the early evening Dad phoned to say that he was shivering. He took some paracetamol and a little later (after we had eaten our dinner) he went to bed.</p>
        <p>Saturday 9th September</p>
        <p>This morning I went straight over to Dad's since he had been unwell last night. When I got there (at about 9:30) he ame to the door as I got out of the car. The carer had been, he had had a shower and was eating his breakfast. He said that he had slept well and made no mention of being unwell! I bought him a paper and a sandwich for tomorrow and Monday. When I got home I strimmed the border near the fence and under the trees (the strimmer started easily and ran well). I also cut one branch out of the laurel by teh side gate (it needs more surgery). After lunch I did the weekly accounts and reconcilled the bank statement. Then I fitted the bearing holders on both sides and epoxy'd the sleve on the off-side half shaft. Neil's torque wrench did not work for left-hand threads, so I just tightened it as much as I could (which I had to do on the off-side in order to get the wrench to 'click'). I also remade Sam's little house, using a cut-down washing up bowl inside the bricks and slabs. Angela added a low front.</p>
        <p>Sunday 10th September</p>
        <p>Angela went to church and I walked to Beeding to buy a paper. I then added some more epoxy resin to the splines in the off-side half shaft. It was then time to walk round to Sandi and John's for lunch (it was their 40th wedding anniversary). We got home at 3:30, having forgone desert, so as to speak with Victoria before they went out. We then spoke with Paul. After dinner I gave Alan an update on the past few days and told him about my plans to take Dad to see a care home for his 'holiday'.</p>
        <p>Monday 11th September</p>
        <p>I started the day by taking Angela and her lunch club items to the Methodist Church and then taking Bay to Goring Hall to see a consultant about her hip. She is to have a pre-op assessment to see if she is fit enough to habe a hip replacement. If so, it could be done within four weeks. I was home just after 12:30 and, after lunch, I went over to Dad's. I filled his pill pot and helped him 'turn over' his bed. We then went to the Victoria Grand residential home to see if it would be a suitable place for him to stay while we are on holiday. He liked it! After tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting at West Chiltington.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 12th September</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning and to Bay's, I put more epoxy on the half shaft splines. It took longer to dry than I thought, so I removed the lining from one of the brake shoes. I also had a call from the manager at the care home where Dad is going while we are on holiday, requesting some information. After lunch I went to Dad's to meet with Emma, the Ocupational Therapist. She checked the bed rail and decided to reduce carer attendance to Monday, Wednesday and Friday, when they will encourage Dad to shower and change his clothes. When I got home I cut the grass, front and back, while Angela worked in the garden.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 13th September</p>
        <p>My first IET Sussex LN newsletter was distributed and within hours I had a volunteer for the electronics club in Lewes. Then I spent most of the day 'playing' with the TC. I fitted the O/S hub and half shaft and removed the linings from the remaining three brake shoes. I also spent quite some time trying to track down a suitable tool to rivet the new linings to the shoes. After lunch Angela went to her first table tennis session of the year. I booked a taxi (Russel) to/from Gatwick for our visit to Victoria.</p>
        <p>Thursday 14th September</p>
        <p>The start of shopping was a little later than usual since Dad was still in his pajamas, waiting for the carer, who now only calls on Monday, Wednesday and Friday! Then we spent time in M&amp;S buying Dad shoes, braces and trousers (which turned out to be too small). Angela also bought a jumper and a sweatshirt for Austin. We then had coffee before doing the food shopping. So it was quite late before we had lunch. Afterwards, Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, while I did a little filing.</p>
        <p>Friday 15th September</p>
        <p>Not a particulalry productive day. While Angela went to Steyning and then did shredding in the garden, I tackled more of the filing. I also ordered a roll-top punch for riveting the brake linings. After lunch I went to Dad's to get him a paper and sandwich and then walk him to his club. Whilst he was there I returned his trousers to M&amp;S and replaced them with a larger size. Later I did some investigation into $ rates and our P.O. money card.</p>
        <p>Saturday 16th September</p>
        <p>This morning we drove to Beeding to buy a paper and get Bay some Tiger balm for her shoulder. I then went on to Dad's while Angela walked to Bay's. I walked with Dad down to the shop to get hispaper and a sandwich. When I got home I helped Angela lay black 'fabric' on the border by the fence, pegging it down. I then covered the edges with some compost to help keep it in place. After a late lunch I tried to order a money card from the Post Office, but the site would not add a new card to the existing account, so I sent them a message. Then I started looking at removing the drop arm on the TC, with the intent of doing a crack test on it. I removed the split pin and nut, but could not get the ball joint remover in place to separate the drop arm from the ball that goes into the drag link.</p>
        <p>Sunday 17th September</p>
        <p>After walking to Beeding bridge to buy a newspaper I removed the drop arm on the TC and did a crack test. Meanwhile Angela went to church. After lunch we picked most of the apples. Then we spoke to Victoria (Paul was out, so we will speak to them on Tuesday) before I refitted the drop arm.</p>
        <p>Monday 18th September</p>
        <p>This morning I went to Dad's to change his bed, do two lots of washing and fill his pill box. While the carer helped him shower I went off to Holmebush to get a rubber ferrel for his stick and change my socks. I also filled the Panda with petrol and went to Halfords to get some split pins. When I got back to Dad's I hung out his washing and put on another load. After lunch I removed the drop arm and gave it two coats of paint. I also riveted a lining on one brake shoe using the roll set punch that arrived this morning, paying for the punch via a bank transfer. Then I drove to Crawley for an IET Sussex LN committee meeting. We had a visit from Matt Barber of the IET to talk about Enterprise Parners and organising a business networking event.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 19th September</p>
        <p>This morning Angela caught the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash while I spent time arranging to cash in a bond and trying to open a new bond account. After lunch I went to the RCEA meeting. It was the AGM (which had started when I got there), followed by a talk on motorway building.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 20th September</p>
        <p>This morning I wrote and sent an email to Matt Barber about the Sussex LN proposed business events. After an early lunch, while Angela went to table tennis, I re-fitted the drop arm on the TC, riveted the second lining to the brake shoe for the off side and re-installed the brake shoes on that side. But the brakes are binding too much. I also arranged a care provider to call on Dad on Friday to continue care provision when the RIS finishes. We then spoke with Paul, just.</p>
        <p>Thursday 21st September</p>
        <p>On our way to do the shopping we called into Next to try to find the tops for Austin that Angela had found online. They did not have them, so we ordered them. We then did the M&amp;S food shopping, had coffee, did the Tesco shopping and were home by about one o'clock. After lunch Angela went to Philip's and then to Bay's. I replied to the GOG documents and then looked at the rear brake shoes on the TC. I couldn't see why they will not close further.</p>
        <p>Friday 22nd September</p>
        <p>A lot of the morning was spent ordering a new money card from the Post Office. Eventually, after two phone calls, we set up a completely new one. I also told RCI to move the maturing bond into another one year bond. After lunch I went to Dad's. But the care assessment person phoned just before I left, postponing her visit until Monday. So I walked with Dad to the end of the road. He went to his club and I bought him a sandwich. When I got home I removed the relined rear brake shoes, but could not find any reason for them binding. I put chalk on the shoes and rotated the drum, but most was untouched. So I sanded the couple of places where the chalk was disturbed. They still bind, but to a lesser extent. I then riveted the linings on to the near-side shoes.</p>
        <p>Saturday 23rd September</p>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday morning we started with a walk to Beeding to buy a paper. Today we had to walk on to the petrol station! When we got home I fitted the brake shoes on the near-side of the TC. Again they are binding, so out came the chalk and sandpaper. Sanding the linings helped, so I will do a little more to both sides. After lunch I did the weekly accounts and then cut the grass, front and back. After an early dinner we went to a concert at the Steyning Centre. A violinist and a pianist. It was very good.</p>
        <p>Sunday 24th September</p>
        <p>More walking; to the BP petrol station in Beeding to buy a paper. Meanwhile Angela went to church, staying for lunch. I then updated the accounts and sanded a little more off the rear brake linings. However, later I found that the handbrake was slightly on and lengthening the cables helped. When Angela got home she cut the turf around the stepping stones and I adjusted the front brakes. We then spoke (for over 90 minutes) to Victoria before a call from Bay asking Angela to look at a letter she had received about her hip operation and saying that she wanted to cancel it. While we were talking to Victoria, Dad called to say that he did not want to go to the care home while we are away!</p>
        <p>Monday 25th September</p>
        <p>We started by driving down to Steyning, where Angela went to the butchers and I looked up the P.O. dollar exchange rate and bought Dad a paper. We then went to Dad's to fill his pill box, 'turn over' his bed and buy him a sandwich. We also waited for the carer from Touch of Care, who are to provide the continuation of carer visits. She was late. We were home for lunch, after which I ordered dollars and cleaned the the filler cap of the differential, which has a breather hole. I also arranged a meeting with Hamish and John and lunch with Simon.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 26th September</p>
        <p>My first outing today was a walk to Steyning to collect the Dollars we had ordered from the Post Office. After lunch we drove to Speedy Spares and the Mayburry garden centre. As well as oil, grease and brake fluid, I bought a pair of walking shoes. Later I printed several maps for our trip to California. I also wrote a blog post for our Sussex LN site, in the hope of winning some backpacks.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 27th September</p>
        <p>Not a very productive morning. I played with grease! I used up the last of my old pot of grease and finished greasing the remaining points on the car, including the water pump. After lunch I topped up the brake master cylinder and replaced the dashboard screws. I also investigated and adjusted the handbrake lever. This morning the new owner of the wood came with two lorry loads of tree stumps, which he dumped just inside the gate. I spoke with Jason and, after the second load, phoned Horsham planning. They said they would not investigate this, but if general waste was dumped then I should contact the environmental officer. This afternoon Angela went to table tennis.</p>
        <p>Thursday 28th September</p>
        <p>Angela started by going to the Health Centre to get new hearing aid batteries, while I emailed STEM Sussex about their proposal to the IET. We then went off to Dad's and took him shopping. He bought a sandwich toaster, which later seemed to work very well. After a late lunch Angela took shopping to Philip and then to Bay, while I uncoupled the prop shaft from the gearbox. I took out the front carpets and the gearbox cover only to find that there was no view of the universal joint. Underneath, access to the UJ was too difficult to get fingers on the bolts. I had to use long-nosed pliers to remove them.</p>
        <p>Friday 29th September</p>
        <p>This morning was Angela's McMillan Coffee Morning. So we started by going down to the Methodist Church. I put out the posters and bunting while Angela set up the tables. Over teh morning she collected over &#163;200. I stayed most of the morning (drinking coffee and eating cake), came home for a short while and then went back to help clear up. After a late lunch I went into the garage to try to remove the prop shaft. I separated the shft from the differential, but found that the front flange wouldn't go into the tunnel so as to clear the cross members and so I couldn't get it out. Luckily I could undo the cap that stops the splined end coming off. Then I could remove the end and withdraw the main tube. I started cleaning the underside of the tunnel and the prop shaft. Meanwhile, Angela tried to get some drain buster for Bay. She couldn't find any, but went to Bay's anyway.</p>
        <p>Saturday 30th September</p>
        <p>We started by going to Lyons Farm, me to get some more paint and emery cloth and Angela to get cat food and advent calenders. We also picked up a paper. Then we took the 'green' chair over to Bay, to replace the camping chair that she uses in the kitchen. While there she said that it would be better for her to go into a care home while we are away! When we got home we phoned Valerie Manor, who have spare rooms, but I need to phone on Monday to see if the dates fit. I then did the weekly accounts. After lunch I cleaned the underside of the TC's tunnel with emery cloth and then with thinners before giving it two coats of Hammerite. Exhausting.</p>
