        <p>Tuesday 1st August</p>
        <p>After breakfast Angela and I walked down to Steyning. She bought some meat and things for a picnic and I went into Bunces to buy some wire strippers and screwdrivers for the Ardingly event. Once we had made a picnic lunch we set off for the Dinosaur Park at Southwater. It was crowded! However, Rowan had one round of the equipment before we went to a grassy area above the 'beach' for lunch. We were lucky enough to find a picnic table not being used. Then back to the park for more play. Rowan found that she could climb the 'volcano' from the steep side and did so many times. We then went to the cafe for ice cream or coffee before returning to the park for a final time. We were home about 4:30, it having been a sunny and hot day throughout. However, Paul was not feeling too well and went to bed while we got dinner.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 2nd August</p>
        <p>Paul et al left early to meet friends on Brighton pier. We then collected Bay and took her to Southlands hospital to have a hip X-ray. We only had to wait a few minutes and so had a coffee in the new cafe before we took her home. Then Angela went to her table tennis club lunch. Since it was raining they did not sit in the garden! Paul got back at about 2:30 and Angela was back by 3:30. </p>
        <p>Thursday 3rd August</p>
        <p>Before we set off for our usual shopping trip we had a call from Dad. He was not feeling well and had pains in his stomach, so we asked him to call the doctor. When we got there he was shivering, but the pains had moved to his back. Shortly after, the Doctor arrived. She could not find anything significant, but thought it could be either a respiratory or urinary infection. So she prescribed a general antibiotic. I stayed with him for the morning and Angela went off to meet with Paul and Krista and to do the shopping. Paul et al called at about midday, by which time Dad had been sleeping and was feeling better. They came home to get lunch and Angela got to Dad's at about one o'clock. So we were home by about two. After a late lunch Paul et al went to visit Bay, while Angela went to Steyning and then on to Bay's. She later took Philip his shopping while I cooked dinner.</p>
        <p>Friday 4th August</p>
        <p>Following Dad's visit from the Doctor yesterday I called him at about 9:30. He had just been for his paper and went into Ellen's. We then took Rowan off to Wardwood Farm Park. We had a good day. Unfortunately I then got no answer from Dad when I phoned at 7pm until finally he answered and said that he had fallen in the hall. His cereal was still in the kitchen, so he had been lying there all day! Eddie and Di helped me get him up. I phoned 999, but a paramedic concluded that he did not need a visit. So I got him to bed and stayed the night.</p>
        <p>Saturday 5th August</p>
        <p>Our 45th wedding anniversary. Chris and Alan were the only ones that remembered. However, I started at Dad's. He only ate a small amount of his cereal. I came home and cleared the holes in the wheels of the ball-launch kits and printed instruction sets for Tuesday. We then took our lunch over to Dad's. He only drank half a cup of soup. When I went back to get him some tea (and made him some scrambled egg) he would not eat anything or drink much and was getting weaker, so I phoned 111 since I wanted a doctor or paramedic to check him. Eventually they said that they would send an ambulance. However, a paramedic called and checked him over. He arranged for Dad to go into Worthing hospital and an hour later an abmulance arrived. I got home just after 9pm. I left a message for Alan, who phoned me back.</p>
        <p>Sunday 6th August</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning doing the weekly and monthly accounts while Angela went to church. After lunch in the garden we went to Worthing hospital to visit Dad. We found him looking well and feeling back to normal. However, the doctor examined him while we were there. He's had a chest x-ray, which showed that he had a chest infection. Urine samples showed no infection. However, his blood pressure is falling to very low levels when he stands up. So they have stopped his blood pressure medication to see if that will help. They also want to look at hisbladder (they had fitted a catheter). Tomorrow he will be seen by a physio, an occupational therapist, someone to look at his blood pressure and someone to look at his bladder. If all is well he could be discharged, but it will probably take longer. Meanwhile, Paul et al met friends in Steyning.</p>
        <p>Monday 7th August</p>
        <p>This morning, while I cut the front grass and the top lawn at the rear and Angela worked in the garden, Paul et al went to visit Bay. We then all went to Shoreham airport for lunch, sitting outside and watching the planes and helicopters taking off and landing. We left the cafe and drove along the seafront to Worthing hospital to visit Dad. He had been moved from the Emergency Floor to Ditchiling Ward. He was dressed and thought that he was ready to go home. However, a number of people still need to see him and according to the Ward Sister it is likely to be a few days before they discharge him. We called into his house on the way home, letting Pat and Eddie know how he was. Alan phoned a little while after we got back, having just arrived back home from Exeter.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 8th August</p>
        <p>Up at six, out by seven and off to pick up Mike on our way to Ardingly. We arrived quite early and wre set up before anyone arrived. Luckily the guides/scouts only came through in small numbers, but continuously. We didn't use as many kits as expected, but we were busy for most of the day. I got home just before seven, had dinner (which was already prepared) and then we went to visit Dad. He is still the same. If all goes well he will be out on Friday, but it might be early next week. Paul et al left at about ten and sent a message to say that they were home safely after a good, but tiring journey.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 9th August</p>
        <p>An exciting day. Angela went off to join her WI walking group to have a walk and then lunch, while I drove the TC to the bottom of Bury Hill to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. It was dry on the way there, but started raining just as we were about to leave. So our run through the country lanes to the Goodwood Motor Circuit, our four laps of Goodwood and my jouney home (after lunch) were very wet. This year the 'parade' laps were at a good speed. I could not have gone faster! However, by the time that I got home I was quite wet. Angela followed me in at about 3:30. So we then went to visit Dad. We got a good update from a doctor. Dad is medically 'fit', but still needs to have his assessment completed by the occupational therapist. He may be able to come home on Friday.</p>
        <p>Thursday 10th August</p>
        <p>We set off at about the usual time to do the weekly shop. However, we didn't need to go via Dad's. Consequently we had finished the shop by 10:30 and so had coffee before returning home. Angela was then able to take Bay her food before lunch while I caught up with the remainder of the monthy accounts and various email. After lunch she took Philip his shopping and then we went off to visit Dad. His assessment has concluded that he needs some help at home and so he has been passed into the hands of Social Services. Consequently he cannot yet leave hospital, even though he has been medically discharged. Social Services should be contacting us. I spoke to Alan and he will come down on Saturday and stay over until Sunday. Just before 9:30 Bay phoned to say that her washing machine was flashing and not working. We went round to find that she had not closed the door properly!</p>
        <p>Friday 11th August</p>
        <p>A busy day. While Angela went to Steyning I put the TC on axle stands, removed the wheels and cleaned under the near-side wings. Meanwhile, Angela made runner bean soup and courgete cake. Then, after lunch, I started pruning the cooking apple tree before we went to the hospital to visit Dad. When we got back I cut some more of the back grass. While all this was going on, someone was removing the three conifers in next-door's garden next to the wall. It has made quite a difference to that side of the garden.</p>
        <p>Saturday 12th August</p>
        <p>We had to walk to the BP petrol station to get a newspaper this morning. Then Angela worked in the garden and I finished pruning the apple trees. After lunch I cleaned under the off-side wings of the TC before we went to visit Dad. When we got back I finished cutting the grass. Alan had driven down early this morning, cut Dad's grass and then went to visit him before lunch. He went back after we had left the hospital and then came over for dinner and to stay the night.</p>
        <p>Sunday 13th August</p>
        <p>After breakfast Alan went off to visit Dad, Angela went to church and I walked to the BP garage to get a paper and some milk. After lunch we went to visit Dad and when we got back we spoke to Victoria et al and then I painted the TC's front number plate.</p>
        <p>Monday 14th August</p>
        <p>This morning I cleaned the TC's chassis, removed the front brake drums and touched up some paint on them and the back plates and then removed the rear brake drums to find the off-side one with a little oil in it and the near-side drum full of oil! In fact, the hub can be moved up and down, so I think the bearing has disintegrated. We had our main meal at lunch-time and then went to visit Dad in hospital. It seems that the social services representative was at today's staff meeting and they are just waiting for carer 'hours' to become available. Angela then went to give blood. Meanwhile I researched the TC rear axle, made some sandwiches and then went to the WSMGOC eeting at West Chiltington.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 15th August</p>
        <p>The first part of the morning was spent trying to reconcile the bank statement against my accounts spreadsheet. Then Hamish collected me to go to meet John Berry, someone interested in being our SLO. We had a good lunch and agreed that John would give it a try. When I got home I went to visit Dad. While out the social worker called!</p>
        <p>Wednesday 16th August</p>
        <p>Quite an eventful day. Angela went walking with her WI walking group. I had a call from the social worker. They will provide a carer each morning for six weeks. After talking with the Welbeing people I went back to the social worker, since they need to request the call button, keysafe and smoke detector in order to get free installation and 13 weeks rental free. When we got home after visiting Dad there was a message from her (Claire) to say that a carere would start on Friday and so Dad could leave hospital tomorrow. So I phoned th ward and arranged to collect Dad at about two o'clock. In between I removed the near-side rear hub and bearing carrier. Getting the hub off took some effort since the two flanges were 'stuck' together. The nut holding the hub carrier to the axle was loose! And there were no shims between the hub flang and bearing. Also, the hub easily pulled off the half-shaft (I thought it was an interference fit), but the latter would pull out a few inches and then got stuck. In the evening we spoke with Paul et al.</p>
        <p>Thursday 17th August</p>
        <p>Today revolved around getting Dad home from hospital. We did the shopping in the morning, taking Dad's to his house on the way home. After an early lunch I went to collect him. He had been in the Departure Lounge since 10:30! I got him home by about three o'clock and then contacted social services and the call line provider. When I got home Angela took Bay her shopping, having taken Philips to him earlier.</p>
        <p>Friday 18th August</p>
        <p>This morning I went to Dad's so as to meet with the RIS man to discuss his needs. He identified various aids and what could be done to help with a visit in the mornings.When I phoned later in the day he was not feeling well, so I went over. He had pains in his stomach and shivering fits again. He had only eaten half a sausage at lunch and a trifle for tea. Later I made him some Horlicks and a few sips nearly made him sick. So I called 111. Dad then slept in the chair until one o'clock in the morning, when he went to bed and slept till eight. The doctor called at 1 am to say that they still had to see three people. So we postponed their visit until the morning. I stayed the night, but hardly slept.</p>
        <p>Saturday 19th August</p>
        <p>The carer arrived at about eight o'clock and 'supervised' Dad washing and getting dressed (in clean clothes). The doctor cam at about ten. He could find nothing wrong, but suggested that lack of fluids and not eating regulalry could cause his problems. I went back after lunch to check on him. I also posted a question about the half-shaft on the TC.</p>
        <p>Sunday 20th August</p>
        <p>We had a day off today. However, we spoke to Dad several times and Alan and Chris came down to see him for the day. So I walked to the paper shop while Angela went to church and then continued to investigate the TC's rear axle. After talking with Paul and before talking with Victoria, I managed to get the half-shaft out of the axle, following a suggestion from Bob Grunau in Canada. Meanwhile, Angela started pruning the rose on the trellis.</p>
        <p>Monday 21st August</p>
        <p>While Angela continued to prune the rose and honeysuckle I sent overdue replies to a number of email. I also read further replies to my post on the MG-tabc forum. We then went to Steyning to buy a paper for Dad and batteries for Bay before going to Bay's to fit the batteries to her door bell. However, the problem was the push button! We then went on to Dad's, changed his bed, put on two lots of washing, had lunch with him and, eventually, got his tablets. We finally got home after five.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 22nd August</p>
        <p>Apart from having a hair cut and going to Steyning, Angela spent most of the day in the garden, which included cutting the rest of the grass. Meanwhile I spent most of the day in the garage. During the morning I made a tool to extract the bushes in the rear axle. I managed to move the near-side bush a few milimeters, but the bolt I used was really too short and too light-weight. So after lunch I went to 'The Nut &amp; Bolt Shop' in Portslade and bought an 8mm by 150mm coach bolt (plus nuts and washers). This was a good fit for teh thick washers that I was using. I managed to remove the near-side bush (although I had put a large spanner under the socket so as to get the bush right out), but could not budge the off-side bush. The thread stripped on the bolt, so I will try a larger one.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 23rd August</p>
        <p>While Angela went walking with he WI friends I went back into the garage. I managed to remove the off-side bush by firstly hammering it inwards a couple of millimeters, to break the seal, and then using the second bolt that I bought to remake my tool and extract the bush. Afterwards (and on through the afternoon) I de-greased the hubs, bearing housings (and bearings), brake drums and brake shoes. I also repacked the bearings with grease. Meanwhile Angela worked in the garden.</p>
        <p>Thursday 24th August</p>
        <p>Shopping day, the first since Dad came out of hospital. We were not particulalry early, but the carer still had not arrived. She came while we were there, having been delayed on her first call, but really had nothing she could do. It was the first time that she had called and Dad had already got himself ready. We asked her to add topping up his squash bottle to the jobs for the carers. Dad came shopping with us, even though his back was aching, and was slower than usual. After a late lunch Angela took their shopping to Philip and Bay, while I went into the garage to start work on removing the differential.</p>
        <p>Friday 25th August</p>
        <p>While Angela went to Steyning I managed to undo the remaining two bolts that hold the prop-shaft to the differential. I then loosened the ten nuts that hold the differential in the banjo of the axle. During this I got a call from the man who was to install Dad's help-line equipment. So I went over to Dad's to find that the carer had not done anything this morning and Dad's squash bottle was back in the cupboard. So I phoned the care provider and told them that he cannot do what he says he can and that they need to get him to shower three times a week and help him change his clothes. As I was talking to them so the help-line people arrived. They installed the box, fitted a linked smoke detector and fitted a key safe. After a late lunch I removed teh differential nuts and, to my surprise, removed the differential. It seems to be in good condition.</p>
        <p>Saturday 26th August</p>
        <p>We started by walking to Steyning to buy a paper, but also to buy a jug for Dad's squash, to take in a prescription and to see if Simms were open (they weren't). I then spoke with Roger Furneaux about the parts I need for the TC before going over to Dad's. The carer was still there and Dad was just getting dressed after having a shower. I bought him a paper and a sandwich before coming home for lunch. Afterwards I sent an email to Roger Furneaux listing the parts that I need. While taking excess beans and courgetes to Mel, we gave some to Fiona and Neil and he came to look at my differential!</p>
        <p>Sunday 27th August</p>
        <p>A more normal Sunday. Angela took Philip to church while I walked to Beeding to buy a newspaper. When I got back I de-glazed the front brake shoes of the TC, refitted the front brake drums, degreased the flanges on the differential and axle and put wax under the wings and running boards. After lunch I severly pruned a laurel bush, while Angela did more work int he garden. Later in teh afternoon we spoke to Victoria and later still spoke to Paul (they had been to a zoo).</p>
        <p>Monday 28th August</p>
        <p>A bank holiday, but it makes little difference to us, except that certain things are closed. We started by going to Dad's. His carer had been, but done nothing, in spite of the note on the front of the file! We 'turned over' his bed, but did not put on any washing since there was not enough in the bin. I filled his pill box and took a repeat prescription to the surgery. We also pruned his prickly bush near the shed. After lunch Angela did some more shredding while I refitted the front wheels on the TC and checked/cleaned the spark plugs. Then I started pruning the first yew bush while Angela started emptying the Johanna compost bin. That meant that I ended up dismantling it, cleaning the joints and reassembling it. We are both now exhausted.</p>
        <p>Tuesday 29th August</p>
        <p>Angela took the car down to Steyning this morning so as to save time, since, when she returned, we drove to Shoreham and caught the bus into Worthing. We arrived in good time to stop for a cup of coffee! After looking at available guides to California, I went off to Maplins and SMC to buy the 'hook' half of 'hook &amp; loop' tape (I had already bought the loop side, thinking it was both) and a battery for the glider, plus some adhesive weights for both the glider and the Cub. We met at Waitrose for lunch, firstly buying a few items of grocery. Afterwards we bought one of the guide books, a T-shirt each for Austin and Juniper, a hooded light fleece for Angela and (eventually) a handbag. After that we used our Barclays voucher for an ice cream, sitting on the promenade to eat it before catching the bus back to Shoreham. When we got home we put the reassembled compost bin in place and, while Angela put stuff back in it, I cut the top lawn and the grass in the front.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 30th August</p>
        <p>This morning, while Angela went walking with her WI friends, I went over to Dad's. He had refused a shower when the carer called! I bought a paper and a sandwich for him, since his elbow was hurting and he did not want to go out. After lunch I bought tickets for Beaulieu on Saturday and applied for ESTAs for us both. I then started investigating car hire.</p>
        <p>Thursday 31st August</p>
        <p>Dad called at 7:30 this morning to say that he couldn't move his left arm. Yesterday he complained of a stiff/sore elbow. We went over after breakfast, helped him do up his trousers and shirt and gave him some paracetamol before going to do the shopping. When we got back his hand was swollen, so I phoned the doctors sugery and made an appointment for the afternoon. The doctor thinks it might be goute, brought on by the kidney problem he had earlier. He prescribed anti-inflamatories, asked us to buy a writst splint and gave us a form to get an x-ray tomorrow.</p>
