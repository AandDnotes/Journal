        <h1>Saturday 31st January</h1>
        <p>A completely dry day for a change. It was also calm, so not too bad for working outside or in the garage. And, at least for me, it was quite a busy day.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We forgot that we also needed some rolls for lunches, so Angel walked back down a little later.</p>
        <p>After putting ingredients into the bread maker, I investigated the front gutter, which had been dripping. Luckily it was only some moss blocking the down-pipe.</p>
        <p>Then I went into the garage and took photos of the boot lid and seal and of the immobiliser. I spent quite some time during the rest of the day looking at these photos to try to work out how the immobiliser is wired. But I didn't get very far. More photos, after moving bits a little, are needed.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had our usual chat with Victoria. Whereas the temperature here was about 10&#x2103;, with them it was -14! The snow was now clearing, but the schools were closed for the first four days of last week.</p>
