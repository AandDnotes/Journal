        <h1>Monday 26th January</h1>
        <p>A dry, but chilly day. Angela went off to her Monday Club this morning, with my day being mainly based around tax. I put together a list of the interest paid by banks and building societies for 2024/25. The HMRC had revised my 2025/26 tax coding by including £25,700 as the estimated untaxed interest. My 2024/25 interest was £17,700 and it should be lower for 2025/26. The letter is now waiting to be posted.</p>
        <p>I also had a reply from the British Motor Heritage, explaining where the body number plate is normally fixed. I don't have that plate, so he suggested another place. I went into the garage and found the number! It seems that the body shell was built before 1992, when the company was still owned by Rover. Unfortunately the records did not come with the company, so they don't know when the shell was made or to whom it was delivered. However, they will send me a letter of authenticity. I updated my 'Numbers' web page, including a photo of the number.</p>
