        <h1>Saturday 17th January</h1>
        <p>Following our usual walk to the high Street on Saturday morning to buy a newspaper I spent the rest of the morning doing the weekly accounts. These spanned the change of year, so I was quite surprised that the reconsiliation against the bank statement actually balanced.</p>
        <p>After lunch I removed the cassette tape deck from David F-B's music centre and removed the drive belts. I had an email from David (from Madeira) and so replied with an update. He said go ahead with replacing all the belts, including that of the turntable.</p>
        <p>I sent a message to Ros to see if I could phone Martin. We agreed on Monday afternoon.</p>
