        <h1>Tuesday 13th January</h1>
        <p>Another day of rain from sunrise to sunset. Angela took the bus to Storrington to bank some Lunch Club cash. I tested my re-designed MG web page, and it worked. So later I started revising the MGB page.</p>
        <p>I then looked further at the 'Repair Cafe' kettle. I finally got the connection to work, but it doesn't stay on!</p>
        <p>I decided not to go to the RCEA meeting, since it didn't sound very interesting, Peter W was not going and it clashed with Angela's appointment for a hearing test. The 'hearing man' increased the volume of Angela's hearing aids and changed the 'domes' to a different type.</p>
