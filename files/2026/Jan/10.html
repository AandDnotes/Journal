        <h1>Saturday 10th January</h1>
        <p>We are still tired from our trip and the return home, in spite of reasonable night's sleep. Today was dry, sometimes bright, but very cold. We started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some milk. Its a pity that we forgot to buy some rolls. So Angela walked back down just before lunch.</p>
        <p>After an early lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. It was busy, with just four of us on the electrical bench. During the session the High Serriff of Sussex (Dr Tim Fooks) visited and was taken round by Robin. We spent some time chatting. I brought home a Dyson vacuum cleaner and a kettle.</p>
        <p>Angela made marmalade from the oranges that we bought yesterday and cooked some mince. There was too much to fit in the freezer, so we had cottge pie for dinner.</p>
        <p>We expected to talk with Victoria, but they were busy, so we will talk tomorrow.</p>
