        <h1>Tuesday 27th January</h1>
        <p>It rained hard overnight and continued to rain for more or less the whole morning. So it wasn't until after lunch that Angela walked to the High Street to buy a few things.</p>
        <p>For me the day was about the RCEA newsletter. I created the April document structure, with spaces for the reports, and started adding the first report.</p>
        <p>As a break in the middle, I checked the tyre pressure on the tyres of both cars. I also took everything out of the B's boot, including the spare wheel. A note in the file suggested that the sparre wheel was flat, but it had a reasonable pressure that I topped up. Things in the boot, such as my tool bag, had some mold on them, so it is clearly damp. There is a gap in the rubber seal which might be the problem. I also took everything out of the Panda's boot.</p>
