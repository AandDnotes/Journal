        <h1>Wednesday 14th January</h1>
        <p>The day started well. While Angela went off with her walking friends I re-worked my MGB home page to make it responsive, then mended my umbrella, where the coveringhad come away from one of the spars. After that, I hung out the wshing and brought the 'Repair Cafe' Dyson and David F-B's music centre in from the garage. Then I started taking the Dyson apart.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the afternoon working on the Dyson. I took out the trigger and found a screw post broken off, but otherwise the trigger was fine. A YouTube video about a Dyson with the same problem concluded by replacing the motor! However, I removed the motor to see if I could spin the rotor, but it was completely sealed.</p>
        <p>When trying to reassemble the cleaner I couldn't pull the power cables through enough, so gave up for now.</p>
