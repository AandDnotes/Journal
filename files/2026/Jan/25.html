        <h1>Sunday 25th January</h1>
        <p>For me, today was mainly about the B. I worked my way through the file of invoices, noting any major work that was done on the car. There was quite a lot. Later I added them to my 'Work timeline' web page.</p>
        <p>Since Angela was out this afternoon, rather than the morning as usual, we spoke with Paul at around 10 am. Rowan was feeling unwell.</p>
        <p>Also associated with the B, I went into the garage and found that elctronic ignition has been fitted. Actually it uses rotating magnets in the distributor. It was fitted in December 2000, so has been working for 25 years. It is about the simplest type of electronic ignition and uses the standard distributor advance mechanisms. I also checked that the access to the gearbox dipstick does have a large gromit in the hole. However, access to it looks almost impossible.</p>
