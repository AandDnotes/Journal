        <h1>Tuesday 20th January</h1>
        <p>My main job today was to get the 'responsive' version of my MGB 'Outings' web page working. However, I started by checking that 'port forwarding' was turned off in the router. But it wouldn't let me log in. After deleting caches and cookies and re-booting the router it let me in. You can't turn port forwarding off, but I could see that none had been configured.</p>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street and did some housework. My next job was to update the IET Sussex events programme file and the 'one page' version. Then upload them.</p>
        <p>Finally I got to work on the web page. I started by trying to rebuild it from scratch, but I had problems that I couldn't work out how to solve. So I copied the original, re-using most of the classes, adding variables and changing 'hard' dimentions to percentage ones. It's almost there. I may try again at some time in the future, but there are pages that I want to produce first.</p>
