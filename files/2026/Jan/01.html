        <h1>1st January 2026</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day and we were not up particularly early after a very late nigh. Martin and Sharon went off just after eleven, heading for Le Shuttle service at Calais. We spent the morning sitting around and replacing the leg on the chest of drawers in the front bedroom of the cottage. I also sent a 'happy new year' email to Peter and Rosmary, including a photo of the B.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I completed and uploaded my 'year notes' for 2024 and 2025. I also had to modify my journal page to use the 2026 files.</p>
