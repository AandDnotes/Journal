        <h1>Thursday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>We started the day by going to Lidl in Shoreham and then to Dunelm for coffee and to buy an ironing board cover. When we got home I finished updating the MGB web pages. Later I emailed Milestone Classics, giving them the link and askin how they know that the car had been re-shelled.</p>
        <p>I spent some time generating images to be used for the posters for the next two IET talks. I also looked at the RCEA write-up for the last talk. Another activity was to remove the 'tyre' around the take-up spool drive wheel on David F-B's tape deck. I soaked it in boiling water and cleaned the capstan. But aing it didn't help.</p>
