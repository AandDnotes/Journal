        <h1>Monday 19th January</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We started by going to SpaMedica at Sayers Common for me to be assessed doe lazer treatment on my right eye. I had a sight test, some drops to dilate my pupils, photos taken of my retinas and then an optical examination. They were very organised and we were home before eleven.</p>
        <p>After lunch I called Ros and spoke to her and Martin. He was having a bad day and couldn't talk. Later I emailed Alan and Anthony (and Aunt Joan) to tell them. We then walked to Steyning Grammar to look at the proposed redevelopment of the school and to ask questions. It is a very ambitious project which they hope to start this summer. However, they still need to get planning permission!</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day I got my 'Outings' web page and the 2025 page to work in their responsive form. Later I started tidying them by using variables. However, this destroyed the layout. It seemed that the Outings classes were not being used. But I couldn't see any fault.</p>
