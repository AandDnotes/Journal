        <h1>Friday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>My first job was to fix the 'Small jobs' page on my MGB web site. Now the panel of entries scales with the size of the view. I had a reply from Milestone Classics, but Carly told me to look where I know there is no number. So I took photos of the inner wings of the B and sent them to them. In the evening I had a call from Jamie and went into the garage to look for seams on the firewall. He asked me to send him the list of owners so that he can look up from who he bought the car the first time.</p>
        <p>I took more photos of David F-B's tape deck and emailed him an update. Later I removed the deck again and removed the capstan and what remained of the capstan rubber. I made a new 'rubber' from several layers of heat-shrink. Now I need to try to put it back together.</p>
        <p>Angela made two trips to the High Street and made a cake, half of which is for us and half for the curch Sunday afternoon service.</p>
