        <h1>Friday 9th January</h1>
        <p>Not a day to go out, since it rained for most of the day, and it was chilly. Angela cooked the marmalade oranges and iced a cake, while I continued with bringing our finances up to date.</p>
        <p>I retrieved the cash from our regular saver accounts and opened new ones, creating standing orders to 'feed' them. I put the cash into our Barclays Blue Rewards account. I also completed our monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>Later I added flavicons to my MGB web page, uploaded my 'Small jobs' page to Github and added a link to the home page.</p>
