        <h1>Friday 30th January</h1>
        <p>The day started dry, but started raining after lunch. While Angela did some housework I did some more to the RCEA newsletter 'supplement'. Later I did some more, so there is now only about five more pages to transfer from the pdf file to the Pages document.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning I went into the garage. I firstly undid all the hood fixings so that I could gain easy access to the battery compartments. I really just wanted a better photo, but it was lucky that I looked again at this. I found that the bolt holding the earth cable to the battery was loose. So I tightened it and took my photo.</p>
        <p>Since I then also had easy access to the grommets that give access to the damper filler bolts, I was able to check that the bottom of the bolts were wet; so the fluid level is fine.</p>
        <p>I also noticed that the top edge of the boot lid is proud of the body. I had seen that the rubber seal does not meet at the top (the join should really be at the bottom) and so there is not a good seal at the top. THis might explain why things in the boot had mold on them. I researched boot lid adjustment and how easy it is to geet the boot lock stuck closed.</p>
        <p>I found that the hood is not too difficult to put up if everything is lined up.</p>
