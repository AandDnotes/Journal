        <h1>Friday 16th January</h1>
        <p>A dry day! Angela went to the butchers and bought a few other things. I managed to convert two of my MBG web pages to 'responsive' and uploaded them to github.</p>
        <p>I did some research on David F-B's music centre. I found a service manual, but although I could find plenty of people selling the turntable belt, but none selling the cassette deck belts. However, it is possible to get generic rubber belts of various shapes and sizes.</p>
        <p>The service manual has good diagrams and photos, although the instructs are a bit scant and missing some details. However, I managed to remove the lid, remove the record deck, take off the bottom panel (I'm not sure that it helps in any way) and remove the top cover. I can now see the cassette player's counter belt, but I need to remove the player so as to access the drive belt. A job for tomorrow.</p>
