        <h1>Saturday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>This morning we woke to a winter wonderland, with a covering of snow. And it was still snowing. I took photos from various windows and when we went to the barn I took a photo from the road.</p>
        <p>Rowan came home on her bike a little after midday. She had been making a snowman with her friend and her clothes were wet, so she was very cold (and tired). So she went upstairs for a while.</p>
        <p>I changed the style sheets for my 'small jobs' web page to bring it in line with the others for the MGB and started putting together a 'work timeline' page. Later we spoke with Victoria.</p>
        <p>After dinner Paul discovered that the freeze was not working properly. They found a pizza box that had dropped down behind a draw, which may have stopped the draw from closing properly. They then pulled the fridge/freezer out and cleaned the back. Now they just hope that it works.</p>
