        <h1>Thursday 29th January</h1>
        <p>Grocery shopping day and, luckily a dry one. We went to Lyons Farm. Angela went into Lidl and I went into B&amp;Q to buy a new inspection light. Then we bought the final two items in Sainsbury's. After filling the Panda with fuel we went on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started putting the transcript from the last RCEA talk into a 'supplement' to the April newsletter. However, I only managed to complete five of the 19 pages!</p>
