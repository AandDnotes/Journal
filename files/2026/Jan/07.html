        <h1>Wednesday 7th January</h1>
        <p>Although the heating was on all night, the thermostat in the hall only registerred 16 degrees. So we went off to Lidl at Lyons Farm to do our food shopping. We also popped into B&amp;Q and then Findon Vale.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the High Street and library and I started trying to sort out our finances. I did the weekly accounts and started looking at investments that are or have matured. I didn't get very far with the latter, since our joint Tesco account would not let us log in, although the value of the bond (before interest) has beed paid into our current account.</p>
