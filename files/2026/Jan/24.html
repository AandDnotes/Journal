        <h1>Saturday 24th January</h1>
        <p>It was a chilly, but sunny day, with a bit of a cold wind. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and then I did the weekly accounts. Following that, I finished putting David F-B's music centre back together. My home-made capstan roller seems to work. At least, the tape transport worked and the record turn-table went round. So I emailed David. They are back from Madeira in a week.</p>
        <p>I had created a 'work timetable' web page while we were at Paul's, so I made a few modifications to that and now need to go through the file to identify what was done when.</p>
        <p>We had quite a long, and as usual, fairly one- way, conversation with Victoria. Just before she called she uploaded some photos of the work on their new house, so she could explain what was being done. They have quite q bit of snow and it is very cold (-11 degrees C).</p>
