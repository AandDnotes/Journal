        <h1>Sunday 4th January</h1>
        <p>Another snowy day. Paul and Krista had cleared the drive yesterday, but it was covered again. At one point there was a rumble and all the snow on one side of the barn roof slid off onto the drive!</p>
        <p>I rewired the floor lamp that had tripped the circuit breaker yesterday and later helped Paul clear the smow from the drive. We also did a bit more of the jigsaw puzzle; a small bit beacuse it is very difficult.</p>
