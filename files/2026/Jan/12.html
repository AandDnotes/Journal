        <h1>Monday 12th January</h1>
        <p>Angela went off quite early to the church kitchen to help with preparing for the Lunch Club. I spent a little time looking at my revised web page design, finally completing it (I think) later in the afternoon. I then set up the 'Repair Cafe' kettle on the diningroom table and dismantled it. I found which connection is not being made, but can't see into it easily.</p>
        <p>Just before 12:30 I went off to the Lunch Club. The lunch cooked by the 'new' cook was very good, but we were both tired by the time that we got home.</p>
        <p>After a light tea I went off to the WSOC meeting at Washington, talking with Chris R and Roger D about Bs.</p>
