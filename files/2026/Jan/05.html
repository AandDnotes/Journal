        <h1>Monday 5th January</h1>
        <p>More snow had fallen over night and since we could see no tyre tracks on the drive we guessed that Rowan had not gone to school, the first day back after the Christmas hollidays. The school had cancelled the day. However, we packed our cases and stripped the bed, taking everything back into the barn.</p>
        <p>But our plans were thwarted yet again. We had seen that the Eurostar trains either side of ours had been cancelled, but ours was still scheduled. However, an email arrived saying that the train would not be stopping at Rotterdam and so we need to change our travel plans yet again. We booked a later train tomorrow, and that cost more money!</p>
        <p>By lunchtime the sun was out and Paul and Krista cleared two tracks down the drive (during his lunch break). However, snow falling from the trees covered these tracks. I joined the Eurostar club in the hope that the extra cost of our bookings, at least for those we had not yet taken, would give us some 'points', but it didn't. You only get points when you make the booking! So I filled in a 'compensation' form. We will see what happens. The expected email did not arrive, which is not a good sign.</p>
        <p>The sun continued to shine and the surrounding countryside looked very pretty, but that was not much consolation.</p>
