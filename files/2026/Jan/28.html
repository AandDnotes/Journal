        <h1>Wednesday 28th January</h1>
        <p>Today was calm and we actually had some sunshine. For me it was a mixture of RCEA newsletter and MGB, whereas Angela went out with her walking group and then went with them of lunch at Smalldole.</p>
        <p>I completed the addition of the first talk report to the April newsletter. Then I, after hanging out the washing (which takes me a long time), went into the garage. I moved the Panda onto the drive so that I could open the B's driver's door fully. I had intended removing the driver's seat so as to lubricate the runners, but the 'latch' was in the way of the bolt. So I greased what I could see.</p>
        <p>Then I removed the battery cover to see what was underneath. Then I took the car for my usual figure of eight test run, just to start it and give it a run.</p>
