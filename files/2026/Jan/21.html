        <h1>Wednesday 21st January</h1>
        <p>Due to the rain, Angela walked with Felicity to the Penfound Hall for coffee. I (almost) completed the 'Outings' and '2025' web pages.</p>
        <p>The remaining two drive belts arrived, so after lunch I put the tape deck back in the music centre. But the take-up spool is still erratic. On closer examination, the wheel that drived the take-up spool has left a sticky mess on the capstan and on the wheel that transfers motion from the capstan to the take-up spool. I cleaned them with surgical spirit, but it made no difference. It looks as though the rubber band around that wheel needs replacing.</p>
        <p>After dinner I joined the Anglian Coast LN committee meeting.</p>
