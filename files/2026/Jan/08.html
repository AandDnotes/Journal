        <h1>Thursday 8th January</h1>
        <p>The house was warm by the morning, perhaps a little too warm. Later I put the heating back on the schedule. The morning was dry and calm, with a forecast of rain in the afternoon. So we walked to the High Street to go to the butchers and to buy some seville oranges to make marmalade.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the day sorting out our finances, bringing information up to date and buying an NS&amp;I bond for Angela. I still have some work to do on it, such as sorting out our regular savings accounts. Angela did some cooking and a lot of ironing.</p>
