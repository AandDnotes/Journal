        <h1>Tuesday 6th January</h1>
        <p>Rowan had 'home school' and Paul worked from home. I cleared some snow (just down the tracks) and then the sun came out. Our Eurostart train is still scheduled, but we decided to take the Metro into Rotterdam rather than the train, since some have been cancelled.</p>
