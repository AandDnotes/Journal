        <h1>Tuesday 6th January</h1>
        <p>Rowan had 'home school' and Paul worked from home. I cleared some snow (just down the tracks) and then the sun came out. Our Eurostar train is still scheduled, but we decided to take the Metro into Rotterdam rather than the train, since some have been cancelled.</p>
        <p>The train from Rotterdam was a just a few minutes late, but there were passengers who were wandering around looking for seats. However, when we got to Brussels it was mahem outside the 'Channel Tunnel' station. We stood, with many others, for over two hours before those with tickets for our train were allowed in. In the end the train was three hours late.</p>
        <p>The journey, in our 'club' carriage, was good, with a reasonable meal. However, we then had to catch the Thameslink train to Brighton and then the last train west to Shoreham. I booked a taxi while we waited at Brighton station and we were home at a quarter to one; to a very cold house.</p>
