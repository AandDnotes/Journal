        <h1>Friday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>We woke, quite late, to find it snowing and a light covering of white. After breakfast, a shower and attempts at our Dutch lessons, we went next door for coffee.</p>
        <p>Our plan had been to go out for lunch, but the weather put us off; postponed until Sunday. We just hope that we can get to the station on Monday.</p>
        <p>After lunch, Paul and Angela took Flo for a short walk while I modified some of my draft web pages. A little later Rowan cycled to a friend's house in the village for a 'sleep-over'. Later (either side of dinner) the rest of us played a game; a very complicated game for the uninitiated.</p>
