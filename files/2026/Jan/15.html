        <h1>Thursday 15th January</h1>
        <p>Another day of rain from sunrise to sunset. I'm sure I've said that before, recently. After showing we went off to Holmebush, since we didn't want to try going over the Bostal. We managed to find our way around Tesco before going into M&amp;S for coffee. At least two of their machines were not working, so we had a long wait. So much so that they gave us a biscuit. However, it was very congested and noisy.</p>
        <p>I then spent some time re-assembling the Dyson. It still doesn't work, so I emailed the owner, including a couple of links to sources on replacement motors. I also left a message for the owner of the kettle (that still doesn't work). So not such a good outcome from the Repair Cafe!</p>
