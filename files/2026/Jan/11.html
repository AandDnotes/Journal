        <h1>Sunday 11th January</h1>
        <p>A cold, dry start and a wet finish. Angela went to church and I spent most of the morning trying to work out how to get a web template (html and css) that adjusts its size and that of images, according to the size of the device on which it is being viewed. I think I'm getting there, but a number of things are not yet working.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria; it was the usual detail of all the options, this time on kitchen design. Then we spoke with Paul.</p>
        <p>So I didn't step out of the door.</p>
