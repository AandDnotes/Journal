        <h1>Saturday 28th February</h1>
        <p>The last day of metrerological winter; cold, but dry, with the occassional glimps of the sun through high cloud. As usual for a Saturday we walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. Today we alto bought a (horsey) birthday card for Krista.</p>
        <p>For me it was then a case of doing the weekly accounts. Since it was the end of the month I set up the March sheet, although I didn't attempt the monthly accounts summary.</p>
        <p>I looked up how to interpret the 'date' markings on the tyres that are on the B. It turned out that the tyres are 15 years old! A long way past their safe lifetime. So I ordered five new tyres from the RAC. I need to take the B to Henfield on Tuesday morning to get them fitted.</p>
        <p>Victoria et al were planning to paint today, so we postponed or chat until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We heard on the radio news this morning (and saw more later) that the US and Isreal had attacked Iran! It is likely that the Iranian ideology, with which people had grown up, will only be strengthend.</p>
