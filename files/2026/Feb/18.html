        <h1>Wednesday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Another day where it rained from start to finish. Angela went off walking with her friends. They caught the bus to Shoreham and nearly got blown away!</p>
        <p>I started by ordering a smaller drive belt for David's cassette deck and then entered all the PAT items from the church into the Repair Cafe log book. Later I asked the team about their views on the 'failure' of the microwave. Andy suggested checking the current limits, since he thought some ahd been eased. I found that the latest IET guide has increased the earth current leakage from 0.75mA to 5mA. So all is well. Robin will get the limits changed when the tester has its next calibration test. I also came to the conclusion that the power distribution strip in the church's audio trolly probably has a surge protector and so I need to lower the test voltage.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street to get some things for dinner (vegetable lasagne) and I did a little to the 'Mighty Meter'. I cleaned the two parts of the broken battery contact and butt joined them with solder. To get any strength I will need to solder on some copper wires and hope.</p>
