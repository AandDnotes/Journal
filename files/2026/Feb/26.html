        <h1>Thursday 26th February</h1>
        <p>During the night I realised that I hadn't written a blog about my IET talk next Tuesday. So before we went shopping (and while the towels were washing) I used CoPilot to generate a blog. After some editing, I posted my blog to advertise the talk. Later, Lisa commented that it wa written in the third-person. So I asked her to reject it and I modified it. Unfortunately it will not be posted until Saturday, but I also emailed Mark C with information to post on LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>When the washing finished and we opened the door, we found a strong smell and some smoke! Clearly the bearing was overheating.</p>
        <p>So we were a little late going off to Lyons Farm, where we did our grocery shopping in Lidl and then called in to Curry's to look at washing machines. We then went on to Findon Vale for coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tested the church's extension leads. I've no idea why the tester sometimes says 'FAIL OPEN', but on the next test passes it.</p>
        <p>Later I added a slide to my Process Automation talk, to match what was said in the blog!</p>
