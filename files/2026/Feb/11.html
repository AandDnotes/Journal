        <h1>Wednesday 11th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking this morning and I cancelled my FIRST Lego League session tomorrow. My bladder is misbehaving and I felt very tired.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning downloading the video files from last night and reducing their size.</p>
        <p>After lunch I removed the top of David F-B's music centre and measured the diameter of the capstan. It was a 2.7mm, so a 2.5mm ID tube should be a tight fit. But I haven't yet found any with a thick enough wall.</p>
