        <h1>Tuesday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>It was a pretty wet day. David F-B came to collect his music centre. He brought a speaker and a cassette tape and all seemed to be well. However, when he got home he found that the play-back was uneven. So I might need to use some neoprene tubing or wider shrink-wrap.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers, in the rain.</p>
        <p>I completed transcribing the text/images from the last RCEA talk to make a supplement to the newsletter. I also got Microsoft Copilot to produce a summary, which I put into the newsletter.</p>
        <p>Later in the day I joined a CC-UK Teams meeting to meet Andrea Lund, our new staff member. However, although only 45 minutes it turned out to be our views on what we want the IET to do.</p>
