        <h1>Friday 6th February</h1>
        <p>I started by generating a blog post on EngX in an attempt to advertise next Tuesday's talk. Later, Lisa Miles approved it, except that she had completely changed it, making it much longer and much better. She admitted that she got Copilot to produce it and then made some edits.</p>
        <p>Mid-morning, Angela went off to the Methodist Church for a funeral service, not getting home until mid afternoon.</p>
        <p>I wrote an article for Main Gear, added it to the B's web site and sent it to Roger.</p>
