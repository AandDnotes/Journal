        <h1>Monday 16th February</h1>
        <p>A tiring day. It was mainly bright and dry, with only a shower in the afternoon. Angela went to her Monday Club while I uploaded my video of Tuesday's IET talk to YouTube.</p>
        <p>The tubing that I'd ordered for David F-B's tape deck arrived, so I cut a piece, but found that, althought eh ID was good, the OD was a bit to big. So I put it on the capstan and rubbed it on some emery paper to reduce the diameter. It then seemed to fit the hole with enough clearance. Whether it will be even enough we have yet to see. I had trouble getting the deck re-assembled, since the transfer wheel slider had jumped out of place. I got the deck back together before lunch, but didn't have a chance to fit it into the music centre.</p>
        <p>I had been messaging Robin about borrowing the Portable Appliance Tester to test appliances at the Mthodist Church. So after lunch I collected it from him and went down to the church. I then spent the whole afternoon testing appliances and extention leads. Bill tested the sockets. We have a few things to sort out and I need to transfer Katthy's notes to the Repair Cafe log book. I brought home a short extension lead that need the plug rewiring. I had problems with the microwave and the laminator, as well as tome of the extension leads.</p>
