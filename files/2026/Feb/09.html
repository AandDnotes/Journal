        <h1>Monday 9th February</h1>
        <p>Angela went off to the Lunch Club a little before 11:30, while I didn't need to go down until 12:30. I arranged a lift for tomorrow afternoon's RCEA talk and got confirmation from tomorrow's IET speaker. I also replied to Colin at Surrey IET LN and obtained a Zoom link from him for thext week's OEI Group meeting.</p>
        <p>Lunch was good and we were home just after three. After a small tea I went to the WSMGOC meeting at Washington. It was raining by then. I had a good chat with Chris R.</p>
