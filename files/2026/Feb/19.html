        <h1>Thursday 19th February</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, and it stayed dry (more or less). We started by going to Shoreham, firstly to Halfords to get some rust treatment and cable ties, and then to Lidl. From there we stopped at Dunelm for coffee before going to Timpsons at Lyons Farm to get a new strap for Angela's watch. We also popped into Sainsbury's for the one item that we couldn't get in Lidl.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela held a meeting in the sitting room. I silver soldered a strip of copper (from a plug) across the broken battery terminal on the 'Mighty Meter'. After cleaning up the other terminals, two old batteries turned on the light (for a while).</p>
        <p>I tested our two long extention leads. They both failed with the standard setting, but then passed with the 'long lead' option. So this should work for the Church's long leads.</p>
