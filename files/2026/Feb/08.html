        <h1>Sunday 8th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I went into the garage (after coffee) to investigate the immobiliser wiring some more. I snipped the cable ties holding the flasher unti and one of the immobiliser cables to a cross member. Then I coud see that the flasher is nothing to do with the immobiliser, in fact the colour of the cables going to it are those shown on the wiring diagra for the indicator flasher. I must check the can that lookws like an indicator flasher.</p>
        <p>Then Iremoved the immobiliser unit and took some more photos. A little later I updated my wiring diagram and modified my 'Details' web page.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday we had a chat with Paul. Their colds are getting better, but they still have coughs. Rowan has one more week at school before half term.</p>
