        <h1>Saturday 7th February</h1>
        <p>We walked down to the High Street in the rain to buy a newspaper and a couple of other things. Angela went to the library before coming home (in the rain).</p>
        <p>Another standard job for a Saturday is the weekly accounts, which I followed by helping Angela prepare her Lunch Club accounts for last year.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. She mainly told us about work on the house, but also spoke about the options that Austin has for Highschool next year.</p>
