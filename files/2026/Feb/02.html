        <h1>Monday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>For me today was about preparing for next week's IET talk. So while Angela went to her Monday Club, I emailed our speaker, produced the speaker certificate, the start slide and the draft attendance list. I had a little trouble trying to put together some biographical notes, but I think I'm ready.</p>
        <p>I also added a little more to my 'details' MGB web page and uploaded it to Github; adding a link from the home page. Later I researched how to make the text on the home page flow as I wanted. However, following a litle experimentation I found that there was a very simple solution. So I uploaded that as well.</p>
        <p>Although I didn't go outside, it did stay dry and calm, if overcast.</p>
