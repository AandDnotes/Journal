        <h1>Sunday 22nd February</h1>
        <p>The owner of the Shark vacuum cleaner called to collect it and left a donation for the Repair Cafe. So I informed Robin. Then Angela went off to church, staying for the AGM and lunch. She got home just after 4 pm.</p>
        <p>I had yet another go at getting David F-B's tape deck to produce good sound. I dismantled it and lubricated the capstan, with a little silicone grease on the lower bearing and a tiny drop of light machine oil (for my beard trimmer) on the upper two bearings. However, it did not make any difference. The tape seems to be running too slow and, at times, at variable speed! So I emailed David F-B, telling him the news and what I had spent.</p>
        <p>Once Angela was home we spoke to Paul. It seems that Tom has suspected diabetis!</p>
        <p>Angela was sorting out her AGM notes and Lunch Club financial stateents, so I cooked dinner.</p>
