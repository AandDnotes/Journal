        <h1>Sunday 1st February</h1>
        <p>It started raining yesterday evening and it didn't really stop all day today. However, Angela went to church this morning and, after sending a few email, I spent a good part of the day doing the monthly accounts, including setting up a new month and the analysis for January in the weekly accounts spreadsheet. I spent some time trying to track down what had happened to the money from last year's regular savings accounts. My notes had not been adequate, but all was well.</p>
        <p>Paul, Krista and Rowan had all been unwell this past week. Rowan had gone back to school on Friday and Paul had only taken Tuesday off work, but they'd had a fever and had no energy.</p>
