        <h1>Tuesday 17th February</h1>
        <p>The morning didn't work out quite as planned. While Angela went to the High Street I started re-assembling the cassette deck. however, I was interupted by a call from Bill E saying that they had found more appliances that needed testing. So I went down to the Church at eleven and didn't get home until two!</p>
        <p>After lunch I completed putting the cassette deck together. It seemed fine until I put the top on, when it was clear that the sound is 'wobbley'. Since the new 'tyre' on the capstan only drives the tape take-up. I can only assume that the drive belt is not tight enough and it is slipping. I emailed a company to see if they knew what size belt should be used. But they said that the information has never been published.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended the IET Sussex committee meeting.</p>
