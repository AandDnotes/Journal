        <h1>Wednesday 25th February</h1>
        <p>Another gloriously sunny day, with little wind and quite mild. Angela went off walking with her friends, ending up at the Hub. I had a visit from an Octopus Energy man who wanted to read the meters. Th,is was part of a periodic reading and not related to the problem with the smart meter. Later they asked me to send photos of each meter and the distance between them, which I did.</p>
        <p>I also had a visit from Bill E, with a bag of extension leads to be tested. He called later to ask about his electric mower that would not start! Later I tested two of the four leads.</p>
        <p>I looked at the B's tyres, noting their size. They are all the same make, but one has some small cracks in part of the tyre wall. There is no mention of new tyres in the B's file, so they could be over 28 years old! The tyres are not a common size nowadays. However, the 'modern' equivalent, and recommended size, is 20mm wider and can rub on the body. However, the MGOCC sell them, but I would need to get someone to fit and balance them. Surprisingly, the RAC mobile tyre fitting has them. I might order a complete set next week.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the B for a 16-mile run, up to Partridge Green and back down through Henfield. I also stopped in Beeding for some petrol.</p>
