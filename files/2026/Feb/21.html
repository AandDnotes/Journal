        <h1>Saturday 21st February</h1>
        <p>On our way down to the High Street to buy a newspaper (and a couple of other things) we called into the church to check that I'd left the switch on the power strip in audio trolley in the on position. We coldn't open the trolley, but by plugging it in the lights on the radio mic boxes were on and we could see the light on the power strip.</p>
        <p>We went on to the Post Office, but they didn't have a cable junction box. So when we got home we went down to B&amp;Q at Shoreham to get one. So later I cut the cable off the Shark vacuum cleaner and joined on the new cable. I then phoned the owner, who will collect it tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I also did the weekly accounts and set the maturity option for one of Angela's bonds. We also spoke with Victoria.</p>
