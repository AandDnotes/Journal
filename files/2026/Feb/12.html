        <h1>Thursday 12th February</h1>
        <p>Lidl, Sainsbury's (at Lyons Farm) and Findon Vale took up a lot of the morning. Then I removed the tape deck from the music centre, removing the capstan. So I could measure the diameter of the 'tyre' that I made from shrink-wrap. So then I looked online for some tubing with 2.5mm ID and 5mm OD. I found some with 5.5mm OD, so ordered 50cm of it. I also ordered a collection of different diameter pieces of shrink-wrap.</p>
        <p>The other main activity today was to put together the video of Tuesday's IET talk. Now I need enhance the audio of the questions.</p>
