        <h1>Friday 27th February</h1>
        <p>Drizzle from start to finish! The day was about the WSMGOC pub lunch and buying a washing machine.</p>
        <p>We set off (in the Panda) for the Stag Inn at Balls Cross, 20 miles away, at about 11:15, with the aim of getting there just before midday. There were over 20 people there and the food was good, if a little too much. I had a good chat with Chris R about MGBs.</p>
        <p>We were the first to leave, since we wanted to go to Lyons Farm. We went into Curry's and bought a washing machine. However, it will not be delivered until next Friday.</p>
        <p>When we got home we were too full to eat anything else or to move from our chairs!</p>
