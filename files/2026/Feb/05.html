        <h1>Thursday 5th February</h1>
        <p>Today was all about grocery shopping and hair cuts, in the rain. So we started at Lyons Farm, visiting Lidl and Sainsbury's, before calling in at Findon Vale for coffee. When we got home I took yet more photos of under the dash, in the hope of seeing more of the immobiliser wiring. A photo from yesterday indicated that what I though might be immobiliser relay (but which had too few cables) is, in fact, the flasher for the red LED on the fob holder.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went down to the High Street (in the rain) to get my hair cut. On my way home (in heavier rain) I passed Angela on her way down to get her hair cut.</p>
        <p>Apart from updating the immobiliser photo on the B's web site, I started writding an article for the WSMGOC Main Gear.</p>
