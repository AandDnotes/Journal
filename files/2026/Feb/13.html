        <h1>Friday 13th February</h1>
        <p>We walked down to the pharmacy this morning. Luckily my tablets had just arrived, so I only had a few minutes wait.</p>
        <p>We had a message from Paul to say that Flo had died this morning. She had beed fine at breakfast, but they later they found her dead, as though she had died in her sleep.</p>
        <p>I spent some time looking for rust treatment, battery cables and rubber boots. I need to go to Halfords for the first two and online for the last.</p>
        <p>After lunch I booked our places on the February Pub Lunch, before I had a Teams call with Lisa Miles about how she had used Copilot to produce a blog entry.</p>
