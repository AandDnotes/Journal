        <h1>Monday 23rd February</h1>
        <p>A dry day, at least until the late afternoon when it started drizzling. Rather than the usual Monday Club, Angela went to the Lunch Club AGM. She got home at around 12:30.</p>
        <p>I logged in to my HMRC account and changed the amount of interest earned in 2024/25, in the hope that the estimated figure for my 2025/26 tax code will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Today was also quite mild, although there was a sharp wind. So I went into the garage to see if I could get at teh B's gearbox dipstick. I removed the central console, thinking that I would then have access to the hole in the tunnel and be able to reach the dipstick. But no such luck. There is metalwork behind the console (the part containing the radio) and removing it only gave slightly better access. I removed the big gromet and could touch the dipstick, but I couldn't pull it out (and probably wouldn't be able to get it back in). So I put everything back!</p>
        <p>I also investigated the battery again, looking to see what appeared to be a box on the cable that comes out of the battery box. It turned outto be a socket to make a connection to the positive cable. I also noticed that the earth lead from the battery is attached to the back of the battery box.</p>
        <p>I lowered the hood so as to make access easier, folding it as suggested in the handbook. I then fitted the hood cover bar and the cover, although I couldn't stretch it enough to put it over all the 'lift the dots'.</p>
