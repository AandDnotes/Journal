        <h1>Friday 20th February</h1>
        <p>I started by completing the appointment form for the health centre, to see a phisiotherapist. Later I received a text message with a link to chose an appointment. The first was not until March 4th.</p>
        <p>We then walked down to the Methodist Church. I put a 'passed' sticker on the microwave and then investigated the power distribution strip in the audio/visual trolley. The tester says that there is an open circuit somewhere. With all the devices unplugged and with the lead plugged into the wall socket, a power socket test passed. However an extension lead test failed. I tried reducing the voltage for the insulation test and selected the 'long lead' option, but still a failure! The only thing I can think to do is remove the strip and take it apart.</p>
        <p>The smaller drive belt for David F-B's tape deck arrived, so I fitted it. It made no difference to the wobly sound. The only thing I can tink of doing is to lubricate the capstan. I noticed that the plug was not clamped properly, so I dismantled it. All the screws were loose and the neutral was almost hanging out! So I rewired it and then did a PAT. I had to use the spindle under the tuning knob to get an earth, but it passed.</p>
        <p>Next I looked at the Shark vacuum cleaner. A YouTube video for a different model suggested that one of the buttons on the top might prise out and I'd find a screw underneath. They didn't, so I will buy a connector, cut off the existing cable and join the new one.</p>
