        <h1>Saturday 14th February</h1>
        <p>The radio and newspaper kept reminding us that it was 'Valentines Day'; not something that we take any notice of. We started by going to the High Street for a newspaper and some rolls.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went to the Repair Cafe. It was busy. We had a queue of items on the electrical bench and I brough home a vacuum cleaner that needs a new cable fitting.</p>
        <p>When I got home we had a FaceTime call with Victoria. We then spent most of the evening watching the Winter Olympics, even though we are not that interested.</p>
