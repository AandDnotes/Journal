        <h1>Sunday 15th Februarye</h1>
        <p>It rained nearly all day. While Angela went to church I uplifted the audio for the questions in Tuesday's IET talk. I then exported it and ran it thorough Handbrake. So is should now be ready to upload to YouTube.</p>
        <p>After lunch Kathy and Bill called with equipment they had bought to PA test items at the church. We couldn't work out how they could do that with what they had bought. They left me with the device (a 'Mighty Meter' that had been David Jordan's and use by him to test appliances), since batteries had been left in it and one of the battery contacts was now broken. I said I would try to fix it.</p>
        <p>I checked with Robin and the Repair Cafe do PAT for people, so I'm trying to arrange for me to do it tomorrow.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Paul. They are still recovering from Flo's death. Rowan has a week off school, but has a maths test when she goews back. She is struggling with maths and science.</p>
