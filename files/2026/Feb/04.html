        <h1>Wednesday 4th February</h1>
        <p>A dry, calm and sunny day. Angela started by going walking with her walking group and I registerd the IET Sussex Network for the Steyning Festival Science Day.</p>
        <p>Later I spent time in the garage. Firstly I removed the rubber seal from the boot opening and re-fitted it with the small gap at the bottom. Later still I added it to my 'Small Jobs' web page. Whilst in the garage I also took more photos under the dash under the bonnet related to the immobiliser wiring. I later did a little more to my diagram of the wiring. But I'm still missing connections.</p>
        <p>After dinner I went to the Steyning Centre to see the film 'Penguin Lessons'. It was very good. Angela decided not to go, fearing that she would not be able to hear it.</p>
