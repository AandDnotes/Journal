        <h1>Tuesday 24th February</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, and it turned into a very sunny and warm. We started by walking down to the church. While I looked at the the cable supplying power to the audio trolley, Angela went to buy some rolls and cooked meet.</p>
        <p>The cable and its multi-socket supply power to the devises inside, but it wouldn't pass the extension lead test. The 'earth continuity' and 'insulation resistance' tests passed, but the tester said there was an open circuit. However, every socket passed the power socket test. So there must be something inside the power strip that prevents the extension lead test completing, even when the switch is on. So I passed it.</p>
        <p>After lunch, in the sunshine, I took the B for a short run, calling into Simms en route. Doug put the car on the lift (after driving one front wheel off the strip) and we looked underneath. It looks in good condition, with just a few spots that need attention. Some small patches of underseal, some paint chips, some slight corrosion behind the headlights and a tyre with cracks in the rubber.</p>
        <p>Before dinner I attended a CC-UK meeting. Some of the IET proposals looks problematic.</p>
