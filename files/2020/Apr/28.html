        <h1>Tuesday 28th April</h1>
        <p>We woke to heavy rain this morning and it continued to rain or drizzle most of the day. So, apart from Angela's quick trip to the post box, we stayed indoors and I spent a lot of the day in the study. I started by ordering the 'grass hopper' robot for Austin's birthday, then looked up RC cars that are available on Amazon Netherlands and asked Paul which type Rowan wanted for her birthday.</p>
        <p>I then replied to Ian MacGilivaray and looked at Greg's notes for Thales, added an introduction, made a few additions and uploaded it to our Office 365 site. I also started making notes on pandemics and started porting another TC article to the web site.</p>
