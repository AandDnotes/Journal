        <h1>Friday 17th April</h1>
        <p>There was a little rain when we got up, but it stopped so that we were able to go for a walk before lunch. We just did the 'round the block' route. Prior to that I wrote two of my IET email for today.</p>
        <p>In spite of further rain after lunch, Angela spread fertiliser on all the grass, front and back. I completed the third email, to the Sussex student. I should have gone into the garage, but couldn't build up the enthusiasm. I did, however, port another of my TC articles to the web site.</p>
