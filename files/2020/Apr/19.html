        <h1>Sunday 19th April</h1>
        <p>Angela's birthday. We were up a little earlier than usual and went for our usual extended 'round the block' walk, sitting out in the sun on our return. A little later Angela had a FaceTime call from Kate.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went in the garage and put some paint on the sender unit and beneath it on the tank. A thick skin had formed in the tin and the paint seemed a little darker. I added just a few drops of thinners to the paint, but it still seemed quite thick. Then we spoke with Paul and Rowan. She was full of beans and and talked constantly and very fast.</p>
        <p>Before, during and after or dinner we polished off a bottle of sparkling wine. This evening was our TV night. Unfortunately, both series that we watch on Sundays have now come to an end.</p>
