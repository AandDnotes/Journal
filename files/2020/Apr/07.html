        <h1>Tuesday 7th April</h1>
        <p>It was a fine, warm day and this morning I managed to get in the garage before lunch. In fact we also went for a walk (around the block) before lunch. Before going in the garage I tidied my blog entry and posted it. This morning I cleaned the chassis and after lunch cleaned the springs. In the process I noticed that the rear exhaust bracket had broken. I started making a new bracket from the stainless steel handle of an old spatula. It cut and filed ok, but I couldn't drill it! Throughout the day Angela pottered in the garden.</p>
