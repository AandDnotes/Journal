        <h1>Thursday 30th April</h1>
        <p>Mum would have been 99 today. Dad did not mention her when I spoke to him this morning. It is also one year since we moved into our little house, so I posted a photo of our red front door on our shared folder.</p>
        <p>It was also grocery shopping day. We were perhaps a little earlier than usual (we left home at 9:30) and were home by 10:30, since there was no queue of people waiting to get in. I sat in the car, phoned Dad and read while Angela filled the trolley.</p>
        <p>It had rained heavily during the night, but we were lucky in that the morning was dry and fairly bright. Later in the day, however, there were some heavy, squally showers. It was also quite cold. So we stayed indoors for the rest of the day. That is, no walk. Angela did some house cleaning and I ported two more TC articles.</p>
        <p>After dinner I had an IET events sub-committee meeting via Zoom. We were just about able to finish it by eight o'clock when the 'clap for carers' happened as it has for the past several weeks. Luckily the rain had stopped.</p>
