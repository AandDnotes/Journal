        <h1>Saturday 18th April</h1>
        <p>Having a late start in the morning seems to be becoming the norm. So it was quite late when we set off to the High Street, via our 'round the block' route. Except that we continued down Newham Lane and went through the cricket field to the High Street. Angela queued at the butchers and I went on to get a newspaper. We then bought some bread rolls at the Model Bakery before returning via Charlton Street.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was spent reading the paper and doing the weekly accounts, which didn't take long. I also uploaded another article to GitHub. After lunch I went into the garage and rubbed down the primer on the fuel tank of the TC and cleaned it with thinners. So it is now ready to try painting.</p>
        <p>At our usual time we had a chat with Victoria and with Austin. She is still having trouble getting him to do things that he doesn't want to do, like writing.</p>
