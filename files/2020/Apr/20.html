        <h1>Monday 20th April</h1>
        <p>We were again slow to get started this morning. It was a sunny, but breezy day and just before lunch we did a reverse version of our 'round the block' walk. Angela spent the rest of the day phoning Jill (on her phone rota), working in the garden and cooking. I did a little preparation for the committee meeting tomorrow and responded to a couple of IET emails. Then I ported another TC article.</p>
