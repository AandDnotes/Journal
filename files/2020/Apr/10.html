        <h1>Friday 10th April</h1>
        <p>Probably hotter than yesterday and sunny all day. So we started by going for a walk, this time an extended trip around the block. At the top of Newham Lane we went up a path that joins the path around the upper horseshoe. Overall it took about 45 minutes. We were glad that we went out then, since it got hotter later.</p>
        <p>At midday we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. We should have been visiting them today for the weekend. We spent about an hour and a half talking with them.</p>
        <p>So after a latish lunch we went outside, Angela in the garden and me in the garage. Angela potted up cuttings and I vacuumed the garage, clearing most of the dead leaves and sycamore seeds, but mainly to remove dust before I put paint on the brake drums and backplates.</p>
