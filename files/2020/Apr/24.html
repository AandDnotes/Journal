        <h1>Friday 24th April</h1>
        <p>We took a different route for our walk this morning, going across to the Rifle Range and up the hill, then down to Mouse Lane. We were out for an hour.</p>
        <p>When we got home I wrote notes on my chat with the Chair of the Solent Network and sent it to our committee members. Meanwhile Angela pottered in the front garden.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage and re-assembled the rear number plate back-plate and rear lights. Angela again pottered in the garden.</p>
