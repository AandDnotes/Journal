        <h1>Wednesday 1st April</h1>
        <p>No April fool's jokes today, but it was a mainly sunny day. We actually managed a walk (yesterday's walk in reverse) just before a slightly later lunch.</p>
        <p>This morning I spent most of the time completing the monthly accounts and transferring Â£500 to Angela's new Virgin savings account. That was the limit that could be transferred each day. I also painted around the new window in the bathroom, where the paintwork was damaged. Later, just before dinner, I put a coat of gloss on the windowsill.</p>
        <p>Apart from a little painting, the afternoon was spent reading.</p>
