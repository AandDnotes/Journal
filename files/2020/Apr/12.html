        <h1>Sunday 12th April</h1>
        <p>Our morning walk took us on the 'extended round the block'. On the path going up from Newham Lane, just after the first gate, we saw an adder basking in the sunshine. It slithered off when it saw us. It was beautifully marked. When we got home (and after sitting outside drinking coffee and reading the newspaper) I replied to Anthony, who had emailed yesterday evening. Somehow this took us up to lunchtime!</p>
        <p>During the afternoon, and before talking with Paul and Rowan, I spent an hour in the garage. I wire-wooled the edge of the backplates and the edge of the drums, then painted them with Hammerite.</p>
