        <h1>Tuesday 21st April</h1>
        <p>We started with a slightly longer walk. we went up the twitten, along the Bostal, down Newham Lane and then around the lower Horseshoe. We came back across the cricket field. We were out for over an hour and it was 11 o'clock before we got home. It was then just a case of having a sit down, reading the paper and then porting another article.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went in the garage, discovered that you cannot 'flat' synthetic enamel (so a problem when trying to 'touch-up' visible paintwork), cleaned the back of the tank and refitted the spare wheel holder. I then removed the number plate backing plate. This meant firstly removing the wiring to the rear lamps and the lamp units. I took photos and made a drawing of the connections.</p>
        <p>We ate early since I had an IET committee meeting at seven. Luckily Zoom have removed their limit of 40 minutes per meeting for the moment. With about ten people it took us one and a half hours and worked so well that that everyone wanted to use the method again.</p>
