        <h1>Wednesday 15th April</h1>
        <p>This morning we did the extended 'round the block' walk, but in reverse. The climb up the first part of the upper horseshoe path was really hard work. It is easier having three steep parts rather than one long one.</p>
        <p>We were late setting off, so all I had time to do before lunch was read email and write to Aunt Joan. Angela carried on potting up plants.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela carried on in the garden and I went in the garage. I removed the spare wheel carrier so as to get at the petrol stains under the fuel sender unit. I found that the earth connection on the near side was fixed under one of the carrier bolts, even though there is a dedicated hole in the chassis. So I cleaned both sides and fitted new bolts. Then I cleaned the sender unit and beneath it and painted on some primer on it.</p>
