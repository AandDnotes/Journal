        <h1>Monday 13th April</h1>
        <p>Easter Monday, although one that Covid-19 has shut down. It was also a very different day, weather-wise, from yesterday. It started cloudy, about ten degrees cooler than yesterday and with a brisk northerly, biting wind. Nevertheless we started the day with a walk. We took our usual extended block route, investigating a path higher up the Bostal on the way. It seemed to go higher and in the wrong direction, so we turned around.</p>
        <p>Angela spent the rest of the morning cooking cakes and biscuits, while I phoned Dad and finished off porting another TC article to the web site.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went in the garage, fitted the brake drums, put some wax under the wings and cleaned and fitted one of the wheels.</p>
