        <h1>Thursday 2nd April</h1>
        <p>We did the weekly shop at Sainsbury's this morning, or at least Angela did. I drove, took money out of the 'hole in the wall' and then sat in the car. I phoned Dad, listened to music and played some games. Angela, meanwhile, joined the queue. Although each person was leaving a large gap behind the person in front, the queue went from the entrance, down to Timpsons and then almost down to the entrance. So shopping took a little longer than usual.</p>
        <p>After lunch we moved another Â£20,000 into Angela's new Virgin savings account. Then Angela made soup and I went in the garage. I think I've stopped the off-side front cylinder leaking, but I have a slight leak on the near-side front. It seems to be coming from the hose joint, although the cylinder seals seem fine.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended an events sub-committee meeting via Zoom. It went well. In fact we did what normally takes two and a half hours in one hour.</p>
