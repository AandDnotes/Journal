        <h1>Sunday 26th April</h1>
        <p>We took the extended round the block route, in reverse this morning. While Angela planted out her broad beans and other plants I investigated the Turing Tumble challenge that Austin was trying.</p>
        <p>Again it was after lunch before I got in the garage. I emptied the tonneau area, removed the floor and checked the differential oil level. I also checked the tightness of the differential bolts. I the started cleaning the paintwork.</p>
        <p>While we were talking to Paul (actually at the end as they started having dinner) Austin called to look at the Turing Tumble challenge he was trying; a different one to yesterday. Later he sent a short video of a simple capture of a ball.</p>
