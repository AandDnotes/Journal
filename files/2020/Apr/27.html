        <h1>Monday 27th April</h1>
        <p>According to the weather forecast, today is the last dry day for a while, so I started by cutting the grass. However, I did the two back gardens and was half-way through the front when the mower started running slow and then started smelling. So I spent a lot of the rest of the day dismantling, cleaning and lubricating it. It then seemed to work, at least enough to finish cutting the front grass. Meanwhile Angela pottered in the garden and did two lots of washing.</p>
        <p>While waiting for one particular screw to 'soak' in penetrating oil I found a solution to Austin's Turing Tumble challenge and sent him my design. I also finished 'washing' the TC. I now just need to put some polish on it before putting the cover on.</p>
