        <h1>Wednesday 8th April</h1>
        <p>Today was the warmest day of the year so far and was quite productive. I started making an index page for my TC articles and then went into the garage. Having failed to drill holes in the piece of stainless steel, I found two brackets that I straightened and bolted together to make a new bracket. After lunch I fitted it.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the time in the garden and I cleared more of the weeds growing on the drive. Before starting to cook dinner we went for a walk 'around the block' again.</p>
