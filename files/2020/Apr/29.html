        <h1>Wednesday 29th April</h1>
        <p>We managed to go out for our usual extended round the block walk this morning before the forecast rain arrived. We then looked for a suitable present for Rowan's birthday. We looked at games, craft kits and walkie-talkies, but Krista decided that the RC off-road car was best. Later we ordered it, via the Netherlands Amazon site, but it won't arrive until about two weeks after her birthday!</p>
        <p>In the afternoon I managed to spend three quarters of an hour in the garage and put some wax on the TC bodywork. I then put the cover on.</p>
        <p>This afternoon we received a box of four cheeses and biscuits from Pong. Victoria and Brandon had ordered it for us.</p>
