        <h1>Thursday 16th April</h1>
        <p>Very much a typical Thursday in these days of lockdown. While Angela went into Sainsbury's to do the weekly groceries shop I sat in the car and phoned Dad. We tried a FaceTime call, but for some reason the video did not work. I then read until Angela came back to the car.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning and part of the afternoon was spent writing IET email. Angela worked in the garden and I helped prune a couple of bushes in the front garden.</p>
