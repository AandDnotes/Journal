        <h1>Saturday 11th April</h1>
        <p>A day of achieving very little. I'm doing three things at the moment; working on the TC, trying to get my transmitter/receiver circuits working and creating a number of web pages from MG articles that I've written over the past five years. All I really managed was to sort out a problem with the web pages.</p>
        <p>We started by taking the long route to the village to buy a newspaper and a few vegetables. The long route was up the twitten and back down Newham Lane, through the cricket field and along Tanyard Lane to the health centre to drop off a prescription. Afterwards I did manage to do the weekly accounts and reconcile my spreadsheet against the statement.</p>
        <p>We had dinner at lunch-time since later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria, for nearly two hours.</p>
