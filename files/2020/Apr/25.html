        <h1>Saturday 25th April</h1>
        <p>Once again we took the long route to the High Street; up the twitten, up the Bostal Road, down Newham Lane and across the cricket field. We started at the Model Bakery, went on to the butchers and then, while Angela looked at the plants in the green grocers, I went to buy a newspaper. After buying some flowing plants, some broad been plants and some vegetables we returned home via the cricket field. Angela worked in the garden for the rest of the morning. We only had three Visa slips, so the weekly accounts did not take long. I then started making a drawing of the rear light assembly wiring.</p>
        <p>I modified the wooden block on the trolley jack to make it locate better on the cup. I then lowered the TC to the ground. I got this done just before it was time to chat with Victoria and Austin.</p>
        <p>After dinner I was writing an email in the study when Austin FaceTimed. He was trying to do one of the Turing Tumble challenges (number 38) and wondered if I wanted to help. We didn't get far and then their lunch was ready. So we will try again tomorrow. Afterwards I completed my diagram.</p>
