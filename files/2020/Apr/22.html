        <h1>Wednesday 22nd April</h1>
        <p>Our walk this morning had fewer 'ups'. We went across the cricket field and then across the bottom of the 'Rifle Range' and down to Mouse Lane. We then went to the pharmacist to pick up my prescription. We were out for over an hour. The breeze was lighter today and wall-to-wall sunshine.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day, on and off, cleaning and painting the number plate back-plate. I took the plate back to bare metal and then gave it two coats of smooth, black Hammerite. This meant painting one side, waiting for it to become touch dry (about 2 hours), turning it over and painting the other side, then repeating the process. It looks very 'hand painted', but most of it won't be seen.</p>
