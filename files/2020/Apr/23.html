        <h1>Thursday 23rd April</h1>
        <p>The sun shone from rise to set and the breeze was light. So it was shirt-sleeve weather. We went to Sainsury's at Lyons Farm. Angela spent 20 minutes in the queue, but was done in just over an hour. Meanwhile I phoned Dad. We tried FaceTime again, but it said that I needed a connection! Perhaps the iD service does not support video over a 3G connection. Julie called again at midday, when we were home, and FaceTime worked over the Internet, just.</p>
        <p>After lunch I had a FaceTime call with the Chair of the Solent Network. He lives in Spain! After a cup of tea we went for a walk; our usual extended 'round the block'.</p>
        <p>Then after an early dinner I had a Zoom call with a few IET committee members about our discussions with Thales.</p>
