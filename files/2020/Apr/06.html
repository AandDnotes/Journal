        <h1>Tuesday 6th April</h1>
        <p>The days seem to be following a similar pattern, although a damp start turned into a sunny and quite warm day. I do things on the computer during the morning and after lunch, following a Dutch lesson or two, I put on my overalls and go into the garage for a while. This morning I posted a message about MG sequoia cream, helped Angela with her lunch club HSBC form and then started drafting my blog post on video conferencing.</p>
        <p>After lunch I finished cleaning the underside of the wings on the TC and wiped around the brake drums. Then, instead of starting to clean the chassis I decided to go for a walk. Angela had been to the post box twice this morning, so she worked in the garden and I walked around the block, starting by going up the twitten. That means the block goes up the Bostal Road, down Newham Lane, along the path behind Lanes Road, Along a bit of Ingram Road, along Portway, into Penlands Vale and then the cut through to our house. A twenty five minute walk.</p>
        <p>Before dinner I welcomed a new member of the Sussex Network (a student who wanted to volunteer), suggesting that he could start an On Campus group or help us to use social media. Later we finished watching the National Theatre production of 'One Man, Two Guvernors'.</p>
