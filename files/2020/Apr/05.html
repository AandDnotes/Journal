        <h1>Sunday 5th April</h1>
        <p>A warm and sunny day of doing odds and ends. After lunch I spent a short while in the garage, finishing cleaning under the near-side wings and running board. We then spoke with Paul.</p>
        <p>I spent some time investigating how to put password access on my 'important' pages, before finding that GitHub Pages does not support server-based operations. So I just left it and emailed Victoria and Paul with the details.</p>
