        <h1>Tuesday 14th April</h1>
        <p>We took a different route this morning for our walk. We went across the cricket field and around the Lower Horseshoe. We were out for an hour. I posted a photo of the 'rock art' that is spread along the path.</p>
        <p>Angela then cut the kitchen garden grass and the walled garden grass. I cut the front garden grass after lunch. In the morning I emailed the PA of a potential speaker from Vodafone and heard from Anthony that my second cousin once removed had died of Covid-19. After a few more email I discovered that he was Aunt Maud's son.</p>
        <p>I also finished cleaning and refitting the wheels of the TC and posted a photo of it.</p>
