        <h1>Wednesday 2nd December</h1>
        <p>After sending a couple of emails I started by getting the case of decorations down from the loft and got out the LED lights. Then I started drafting my Christmas letters. At midday I attended the online Eurotherm 'Christmas Lunch'.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went for a walk and I made notes for each of the specific Christmas letters.</p>
