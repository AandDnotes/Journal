        <h1>Thursday 3rd December</h1>
        <p>A busy day and a rainy one. In fact it rained all day. I started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. He looked well and I showed him photos of Austin and Juniper.</p>
        <p>I then went on to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop. That took the rest of the morning. After lunch I caught up with some email, but forgot that I was due to host a PEI group meeting this evening until I received an email from one member. I sent out a reminder, but only three people attended. I need to schedule the other meetings so that they go into their calendars.</p>
