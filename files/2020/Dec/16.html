        <h1>Wednesday 16th December</h1>
        <p>I started by fixing the new outside light on the house wall by the front steps. Then I took the rear near-side wheel off the Panda to check that there was nothing falling off. That all took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis and I updated my December Newsletter and the 'Saturn' blog. Then I replied to someone at NPL about having another talk from them next year. I also started looking at how I could make the 2021 calendar photos available on a web site.</p>
        <p>At six o'clock I joined the Culham tour about the fusion machines on site. So we had a late dinner.</p>
