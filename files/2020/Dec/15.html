        <h1>Tuesday 15th December</h1>
        <p>I don't think I poked my head out of the door today. At least Angela put out the washing and walked to the post box. It was dry, reasonably mild and quite bright.</p>
        <p>I spent a good part of the day working on my December newsletter. By the end of the day I had sent a test version to Greg for review. My other activity was the December meeting of the Gift Oversight Group. Luckily it was done in half an hour, so I had time to investigate why I had almost used all my Google space. It seemed that when I moved a lot of files to iCloud they also ended up in the Google Bin, over 7GB of them. So I emptied the bin.</p>
        <p>Victoria uploaded a few photos of Austin and Juniper playing in the snow, even though it was only a dusting.</p>
