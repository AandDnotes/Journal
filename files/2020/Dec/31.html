        <h1>Thursday 31st December</h1>
        <p>New Year's Eve and another cold day. Angela went to the butchers and did some shopping for Gill. I took some further measurements of the garden and finished making a drawing of it. I then produced a drawing of a possible design.</p>
        <p>We also almost finished the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
