        <h1>Friday 25th December</h1>
        <p>A sunny, but cold Christmas Day. We had only just finished getting showered when Paul FaceTimed. He also called later, as we were eating lunch and he added Victoria a little later. We had a good started, and then a very traditional Christmas meal and pudding.</p>
        <p>As the sun went down so we went for a walk around the local streets to see what Christmas lights people had. Just as we arrived hoe so Paul FaceTimed again, this time to play games. We started with a few rounds of racing to find something and then played bingo. Rowan was the caller.</p>
