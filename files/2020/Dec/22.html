        <h1>Tuesday 22nd December</h1>
        <p>We were a little late getting going, but we walked up the twitten and on to Kingsmead to deliver Christmas cards. We then went to Rosemary Close and on to Church Street before calling in at Newham Lane, all to deliver more cards. We just got back home in time to make lunch. After lunch Angela delivered the local cards.</p>
        <p>I wrapped Dad's presents and then found a set of bingo cards to download and sent them to Rowan. I also did just a little more to my page on 'control'.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the crossings into mainland Europe were all closed to people and therefore trucks, due to the new strain of Covid-19 that is sweeping the UK. This evening there seems to have been no resolution. Certainly the statistics are not looking good and I suspect that soon we will all be in tier 4 (essentially lockdown). In spite of everyone saying that the supermarkets have plenty of stock, people have already started panic buying.</p>
