        <h1>Friday 18th December</h1>
        <p>Before I came down for breakfast a parcel arrived. It was a collection of cheeses from Victoria et al.</p>
        <p>We then started with a good run to the tip in Shoreham, then to Screwfix and on to Dunelm. We finally disposed of the old mower, which had been taking up space in the garage, but we only bought a roasting pan.</p>
        <p>When we got home, Angela walked down to the butchers and I updated my newsletter, before submitting it for approval. I then spent time clearing a lot of email that had been building up.</p>
        <p>One of the cheeses was a goats cheese and was very smelly. So Angela made a goats cheese pizza. It was good.</p>
