        <h1>Thursday 24th December</h1>
        <p>A bright, but chilly Christmas Eve. In fact it was really too cold to go out. The furthest I went was to the recycling bin. However, I did print two bingo cards and made two sets of counters. Apparently Rowan does not seem enthusiastic, but we are prepared if she want to play.</p>
        <p>The news broadcasts (mainly on the radio) kept talking about an announcement about a Brexit deal for a lot of the day. It seems that it was quite late in the afternoon before Boris made a statement. Now everyone wants to read the 2,000-page document.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon we had a FaceTime call with Kate and Dick. The connection kept breaking, but it was good to talk with them.</p>
