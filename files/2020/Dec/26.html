        <h1>Saturday 26th December</h1>
        <p>A Boxing Day of mixed weather. It started dry and reasonably warm, but breezy. By lunch-time it was raining and gales are forecast over night. Luckily, while Angela went to the High Street to get some milk, I started fixing our new house numbers on the front wall. Since the bricks are quite 'bumpy' it was difficult to get the holes in the right place. I just hope that Angela doesn't notice that the number one is not quite vertical.</p>
        <p>After that I cleaned out the the rear gutters and cleaned the roff over the back door. Hopefully they will cope with the coming storm and the extra load from Lynn's garage roof.</p>
        <p>Angela cooked a chocolate roulade, but otherwise we just did some of the jigsaw.</p>
