        <h1>Wednesday 9th December</h1>
        <p>A less frantic day. Certainly a later start. There was little in the way of fog today and, although quite chilly (about six degrees) there was little in the way of breeze. This didn't help the washing to dry, but made a walk around the lower horseshoe after lunch quite pleasant.</p>
        <p>I scheduled the three further PEI Group Zoom meetings. Initially I exported what I though was just one entry in my calendar and sent the three calendar entries to the group. However, I discovered that each export contained the whole of my calendar! So I added the email addresses of the group to the iCal entry and tried 'sending' the entry. Nothing seemed to happen so I sent the invite via email.</p>
        <p>We brought the Christmas tree in from the garage, wrapped the pot and started testing the lights (two of which were broken).</p>
