        <h1>Monday 14th December</h1>
        <p>The day started with a trip to Victoria Grand to see Dad. Whilst there I got him to write his Christmas cards. In fact that is really all we did. I noticed a pronounced clonk coming from the rear, near-side wheel when it went over a bump. I will need to investigate it since the rear dampers were replaced at the service a couple of months ago.</p>
        <p>When I got home I transferred some money into Victoria's account for her birthday and emailed her.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a Zoom call with the 'Eurotherm' group. There were only seven of us on the call. I then ordered Christmas presents, in the form of Amazon gift cards, for each member of our US and Netherlands families.</p>
