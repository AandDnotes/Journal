        <h1>Friday 4th December</h1>
        <p>We started by walking to the butchers and then went on to the library. It was dry when we went out, but started raining as we left the library. I started making notes on yesterday's PEI Zoom meeting and finally finished it just before dinner in the evening. In between I ordered an outside light and stainless steel house numbers. Also, Angela did her monthly WI accounts and we investigated reading lamps for the sitting room.</p>
