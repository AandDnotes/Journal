        <h1>Tuesday 8th December</h1>
        <p>A busy day with an early start. The alarm went off at 5:45 and we left the house at 6:45 for Worthing Hospital since it was the day for Angela to have her ear operations. There were no traffic queues and so we arrived a little early. I had intended going on to Screwfix in Shoreham, but I had forgotten to take my mask.</p>
        <p>On the way home a warning light came on in the Panda. It was a 'general' warning that could mean a bulb had blown or any of a range of problems, but none too serious. When I got home I checked all the bulbs, along with the oil and water. All seemed well. When I went out later the light did not come on.</p>
        <p>I got a call from the hospital at five to one and so went to collect Angela. I had just finished an early lunch and luckily she had been given a sandwich. All had gone well. We came home via Screwfix. The fog had got worse during the day at home, but it was sunny in Worthing.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I joined an IET talk on flood modelling (as the backup), which didn't say a lot about modelling.</p>
