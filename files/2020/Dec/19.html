        <h1>Saturday 19th December</h1>
        <p>The day that many in the UK had their Christmas family gatherings cancelled. At the moment it doesn't affect us and we are planning to be on our own anyway.</p>
        <p>We started with a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and to get a notepad and pen for Dad. We then touch a slightly round-about route home, but sticking to pavements. I finished off my Notebook page and emailed the grandchildren. Then the rest of the morning was spent reading the paper.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spent a good part of the afternoon talking with Victoria. Austin and Juniper seem to be enjoying the snow. Then it was back to the newspaper. Which was just as well, since we had quite a lot of rain.</p>
