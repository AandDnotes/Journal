        <h1>Wednesday 23rd December</h1>
        <p>I dropped Angela at Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm, with a trolley token and a collection of bags. I then went off to Victoria Grand. When I arrived there was a pharmacy delivery man waiting for the list of medicines required by the residents. They were not using the small lounge today, so I had to wait while the carer went to find out the combination to get in the gate. Unfortunately she then couldn't open it, so I had to wait for someone else. So we used a corner of the big lounge. It seems that the residents had all gathered in there yesterday for some entertainment. I showed him the 'snow' videos and we had a short chat with Paul and Rowan.</p>
        <p>Getting out was almost as difficult. The gate was locked, but luckily the carer was still trying to put back up the screen that had blown over when she opened the door.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately Angela had been waiting in the cold for me for half an hour. The afternoon really just disappeared, although I did start a possible article for the WSMGOC Main Gear.</p>
