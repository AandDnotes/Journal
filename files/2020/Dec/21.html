        <h1>Monday 21st December</h1>
        <p>The shortest (and very rainy) day. Angela went out twice (in the rain), firstly to the High Street to get some rolls and then later to the library. However, I only stepped out of the back door to put waste in the compost bin!</p>
        <p>So I started writing the 'control' section of my ROM career chapter. Although I did phone Dad after lunch.</p>
