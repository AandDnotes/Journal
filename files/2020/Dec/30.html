        <h1>Wednesday 30th December</h1>
        <p>It was sunny nearly all day, with a bright full moon setting in the morning. I took a photo, cropped it and put it on Google Photos. Angela started by walking to the butchers, to find that they were closed. Since the weather is forecast to be wintery tomorrow, so we decided to do the weekly shop today. But the list was small, so Angela decided to walk down to the Coop, with the basket on wheels.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I tightened the rope on my fence bracing and checked Dad's current account.</p>
        <p>Apart from doing more of the jigsaw puzzle, I installed the PySerial library on the MacBook Air and found some examples of its use. Then, just before it got dark, we measured the walled garden and I started drawing a plan.</p>
