        <h1>Sunday 20th December</h1>
        <p>It was a day for mainly staying in, with showers for most of the morning. I spent some time reading articles in TTT2 and re- writing notes on nuclear reactor design that I 'lost' the other day.</p>
        <p>We had an early chat with Paul since Angela went to a candle-lit service at four, our usual time for a chat. We then started watching TV a little earlier than usual.</p>
