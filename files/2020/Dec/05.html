        <h1>Saturday 5th December</h1>
        <p>A busy morning. We started by walking to the Coop, where I went in to buy a few items, including a newspaper. Not long after we got back we went off to Southlands Hospital (a little early) where Angela had an appointment for a Covid-19 test. She was actually out by the time of her appointment. It seems that we now both need to 'isolate' until her day surgery on Tuesday. This means that I can't go on the 'London' walk on Monday.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. She is still having difficulty getting Austin to do any school work. Then I updated the monthly accounts.</p>
