        <h1>Tuesday 1st December</h1>
        <p>A sunny day, but the sun doesn't reach our house until 10 o'clock and then is gone by four.</p>
        <p>Angela went off to the Grammar School to pick up the copies of her WI programme and I went to the Post Office to post Victoria's birthday card and buy Christmas stamps. There was quite a queue.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleared the weeds from the drive before it got too cold. However, the grass between the blocks remains.</p>
        <p>We had an early dinner, because I was hosting an IET lecture webinar. It seemed to go very well.</p>
