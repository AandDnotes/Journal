        <h1>Thursday 10th December</h1>
        <p>We started with an earlier than usual start to Lyons Farm. We had finished our supermarket shop and were home by 10:30. Then, before lunch, I watched the webinar on hydrogen for transport.</p>
        <p>Later I caught up on some reading of Totally T-Type and other things.</p>
