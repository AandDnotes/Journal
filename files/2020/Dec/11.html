        <h1>Friday 11th December</h1>
        <p>We started with our usual Friday walk to the butchers. I went on to the pharmacy to collect my repeat prescription and then met Angela at the library. It was a pity that it poured with rain in between. However, it was mild; no gloves or hat.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent writing Christmas cards and trying to glue my San Fransisco belt back together. For a Levi brand it is very poor quality. It looks like two layers of thin leather sandwiching some other cardboard-like material.</p>
        <p>Our new house numbers, which should have been delivered yesterday, have still not arrived.</p>
