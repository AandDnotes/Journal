        <h1>Tuesday 29th December</h1>
        <p>Since it was dry and calm, if somewhat cold, we decided to go for a walk after breakfast. We were out for an hour and three quarters, going down to the river.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was essentially spent doing the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>After dinner I attended a BMFA webinar on scale modelling. It didn't help much, being totally about the different types of scale modelling and examples of the kits available and what people had built.</p>
