        <h1>Monday 28th December</h1>
        <p>A very wet bank holiday. We had planned to go for a walk, but by mid-morning it had started raining and it continued for the rest of the daylight hours. So we spent a lot of the day working on the jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned Dad and it was still raining.</p>
