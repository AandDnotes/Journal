        <h1>Sunday 27th December</h1>
        <p>Storm Bella passed through over night and took one of our fence panels with it. One of the post had snapped off at the base and the panel forced out of the side strips. Unfortunately the panel had fallen across the twitten and so we went out before breakfast to rescue it. I had to prise off one of the side battens on each side, which were still attached to the posts, raise the panel and then nail the battens back on. I then had to brace the post. So I used rope to pull it up and a length of wood to push is back against the rope, fixing the rope to my wrecking bar driven into the ground and the wood wedged between a block nailed to the post and a cold chisel in the ground.</p>
        <p>We were ready for breakfast and we spent the rest of the morning working on the jigsaw puzzle. Later we spoke with Victoria and Austin.</p>
