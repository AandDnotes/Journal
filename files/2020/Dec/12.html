        <h1>Saturday 12th December</h1>
        <p>Being a Saturday we started by a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper, although we did post a collection of Christmas cards. We then walked home via the lower horseshoe. After coffee I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. Austin and Juniper were not very chatty today. Brandon was still making beer!</p>
        <p>Angela wrote the rest of our Christmas cards while I wrote Dad's cards.</p>
