        <h1>Sunday 13th December</h1>
        <p>It seemed to rain all day. We decided to shower today, since I need to go to Victoria Grand in the morning to see Dad. Then Angela started by going to church. I spent the rest of the morning downloading the recording of last Tuesday's talk, editing it and uploading it to our YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>I read the GOG documents for Tuesday's meeting and later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. I then prepared images for this month's newsletter while Angela cooked.</p>
