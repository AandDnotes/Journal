        <h1>Thursday 17th December</h1>
        <p>Angela did a batch of washing and hung it out before we set off to do the weekly supermarket shop. It was nearly lunchtime before we got home.</p>
        <p>After lunch (which really means after doing our Dutch lessons) we tracked down how Angela could cancel her gift aid for the NT tree planting donations. I then photographed the photos in the 2021 Country File calendar and experimented with html 'grid' and responsiveness. As a result I produced a page in my Projects repository that will allow someone to download each of the photos and should cope with different types of devices.</p>
