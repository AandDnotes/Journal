        <h1>Wednesday 30th September</h1>
        <p>The morning was warm and quite bright, but then we had some heavy showers. Luckily Angela stayed dry when she went to table tennis after lunch.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day putting the bench back together and cleaning the top surface with a plane and a furniture scraper. I then added another couple of pages to my Notebook.</p>
