        <h1>Friday 25th September</h1>
        <p>The morning was cold and windy, although the showers stopped early. It was little warmer, but calmer and much brighter after lunch.</p>
        <p>But it was another day mainly dealing with IET email and actions. Although, while Angela took a trip to the garden centre, I did replace the grills in the kitchen above the boiler and fridge/freezer cupboards with the new vent grills that we bought yesterday. I discovered that the plinth below the boiler cupboard had a gap above it and so did not need a vent. The plinth under the freezer does not have clips, but is just a tight fit. However, it is a little short and so has a gap at either end. It is also not cut around the skirting board, so again there is not really any need for a vent. Consequently I have two spare vent grills!</p>
