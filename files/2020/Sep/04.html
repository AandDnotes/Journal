        <h1>Friday 4th September</h1>
        <p>My day started with a Zoom meeting with Mike and Dave about the events programme. As usual I ended up with a couple of actions. Meanwhile, Angela went to the butchers. I then spent the rest of the morning forwarding the results of the social media survey and dealing with email.</p>
        <p>The window cleaners came while we were preparing lunch, after which I rubbed down the woodwork in the kitchen and gave it a coat of undercoat. I added some water to the paint to thin it and it went on much more smoothly.</p>
