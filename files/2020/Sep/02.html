        <h1>Wednesday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>Angela had a busy day. She went walking with her WI friends this morning and then went to table tennis this afternoon. I checked over both cars and took the TC for a short drive. The engine seemed to run well and I put 15 litres of petrol in the tank.</p>
        <p>I also put some primer on the three short pieces of skirting board that I made yesterday. Then I did a little more to my stop motion video.</p>
