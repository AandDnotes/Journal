        <h1>Tuesday 29th September</h1>
        <p>I started by emailing Supreeth about the possibility of a virtual heat of PATW while Angela went to the High Street. We then both spent the rest of the morning in the garden. I helped spike the front lawn and then brushed weeds off the drive while Angela put feed on the grass.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started by clearing the bench in the garage. I then fitted remaining telescopic runner in the oven. Then I thought I would try to close the gaps between the planks. However, I ended up dismantling half the bench and planing both the ends of the centre plank edge and the strip that joins the plank to the front one. I'll work on the back plank tomorrow.</p>
