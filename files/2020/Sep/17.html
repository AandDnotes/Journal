        <h1>Thursday 17th September</h1>
        <p>The kitchen got very close to completion today. James came at about three o'clock and had fitted the shelves, replacement panel and plinths by just after four. However, he did need to adjust the plinths under the boiler cupboard and fridge, since he seemed to think that having some concrete exposed was acceptable.</p>
        <p>The morning, however, was the usual Thursday schedule. I dropped Angela in Worthing and went on to visit Dad. While there I phoned uncle Mick. I then met Angela at Waitrose, where we had coffee before shopping for groceries.</p>
        <p>Later I added more to my notes on our social media strategy and replied to Greg about his resignation.</p>
