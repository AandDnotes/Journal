        <h1>Friday 18th September</h1>
        <p>The kitchen is finally finished! The glass supplier didn't arrive until about ten past four, but it only took him ten minutes to fit the glass splash-back. So I took the final photo and produced a video of the kitchen from old to new. I also made a panorama (which wouldn't join very well) and posted both on Google Photos.</p>
        <p>Prior to that, I spent most of the day in front of a screen. I finished my notes on social media and distributed it, replied to our student after he had seen my notes and replied to Greg. Towards the start of this, at about 10:30, Angela set off for the butchers. Half an hour later she came in saying that she had found a home for our old microwave. She had been talking with our new neighbour opposite and they were in need of one. They are Christine and Peter, have moved from Dorset, although used to live in Storrington, where their daughter lives.</p>
