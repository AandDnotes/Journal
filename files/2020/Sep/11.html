        <h1>Friday 11th September</h1>
        <p>I started by finishing painting the kitchen walls, at least with their first coat, while Angela went to the butchers. Then I paid Victoria Grand the September arrears and we also paid Lifestyle the 'gas' invoice for Â£250 from the RBS account. Before lunch I also fixed the outside thermometer, that Kate had given Angela, to the wall outside the small sitting room window. I didn't really want to use the hammer drill, but the bricks were quite hard, even with the new masonry bit.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was back to painting. I spent the afternoon giving a second coat to the edges of the ceiling, window, door and cupboards and around the sockets and switches.</p>
