        <h1>Sunday 6th September</h1>
        <p>Angela returned to church for the first time this morning, but she was home by 11:30. Meanwhile I did the monthly accounts and prepared things for our trip to the WSMGOC South Downs Picnic on the day that should have been the South Downs Run. We took the TC out of the garage at about ten to eleven, so most people were at the Patching Village Hall, since the start was at midday. Luckily the rain kept off, but people started leaving quite early (we were to finish by four) because it was getting a little chilly.</p>
        <p>Since we were home earlier than expected we contacted Paul, but they were at Greet's, since tomorrow is their wedding anniversary. So they called us later.</p>
        <p>We finished the lunch from our picnic for our tea.</p>
