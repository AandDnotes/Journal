        <h1>Tuesday 1st September</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier this morning since were were expecting the Southern Counties Glass man to measure for the splash-back. He arrived at about 8:30, expecting to measure all the way around the worktop. However, to just do the section behind the hob did not take long. He used a laser measure as well as a tape.</p>
        <p>I then spent the rest of the day making and fitting pieces of skirting around the boiler cupboard and larder. I now need to prime them before I screw them in place. In the middle of this I phoned Dad at Victoria Grand and arranged to visit him on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street and later to the Post Office. In the evening she had a church meeting via Zoom.</p>
