        <h1>Tuesday 8th September</h1>
        <p>We had a good day. We left at ten, stopped at Cobham for a coffee and arrived at Langley Park just after midday. Kate and Dick had arrived a few minutes earlier. We talked, had lunch, went for a walk, had tea and cake and left just before 6:30. That meant that we were home just before eight. The weather started overcast but became brighter as the day went on.</p>
        <p>When we got home we discovered that our new neighbours had moved in opposite.</p>
