        <h1>Monday 21st September</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela went to the church garden for a 'socially distanced' coffee morning. I started populating the newsletter template and checked over the TC. I also tightened the fuel connections, although they didn't seem loose.</p>
        <p>So after lunch I took the TC out for a run, while Angela had a WI gathering in the cricket field. I went down Clays Hill, on to Shoreham, over the Norfolk Bridge and on through Worthing to Grand Avenue. Then I went over the railway crossing, up to Thomas a Becket and on to Washington before turning home. 25 miles in all. The car seemed to run well.</p>
        <p>Then I finished the newsletter, including getting a test email. Tomorrow I will get a test email sent to Bernard for review.</p>
