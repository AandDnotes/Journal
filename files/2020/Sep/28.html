        <h1>Monday 28th September</h1>
        <p>Angela worked hard in the garden today, raking and cutting and spiking lawns, emptying and replanting planters, taking and potting cuttings and planting bulbs.</p>
        <p>The morning didn't really start very early; after showering it was ten o'clock by the time I was ready to start. The rest of the morning was spent adding a list of links to the event programmes of other local Networks and PEIs to the IET Sussex web site. The table added to the blog page was stripped out when it was saved, just leaving the content. So I had to edit the source.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I finished making the stop motion video of 'Why to things fall over?' and I posted it on Google Photos.</p>
