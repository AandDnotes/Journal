        <h1>Saturday 26th September</h1>
        <p>Our daily walks have regressed into a walk once or twice a week, at least for me. This morning, after Angela had walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things, we went for a longer walk. Up the snake path, down and across to the lower horseshoe, around it, down the edge of the rifle range and back across the playing field. So that was the morning mainly over, although I did do the weekly accounts and transfer some of Dad's money so that there is enough in his current account to pay his rent.</p>
        <p>We had an early lunch so that we were free to talk to Victoria. Later I spent some time working on my 'why things fall over' stop motion video. Again iMovie did not show any transitions, so after a look on the Apple support site I shut the iMac down, removed the power cord for 15 seconds, plugged it back in for five seconds and then restarted. Much to my surprise the transitions were back.</p>
