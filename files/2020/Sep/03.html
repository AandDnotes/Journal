        <h1>Thursday 3rd September</h1>
        <p>Shopping day. But overcast and breezy, although quite warm. We started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. He had fallen over and had a big plaster on his forehead. The carer said that it was not too bad. Also, their Covid-19 tests seems to have been clear. She also asked if we could get him a wet razor, since he couldn't get a close shave with his electric one. She said that she would shave him. He did look quite frail and used the call button to summon someone when he wanted to go back to his room.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Waitrose and had a coffee in their cafe!. We then did the weekly shop. I went across the road to the Dulux trade shop to try to buy a test pot, but they only mix paints and a test tin cost over five pounds. So, since we were stopping at Lyons Farm to fill up with petrol, we went into B&amp;Q and bought two small samples. Angela also found some house plant potting compost.</p>
        <p>When we got home we found a parcel inside the back gate. I had ordered two 'suction' towel rails and assumed that the parcel contained them, even though it was an odd shape. In fact it was the glass shelf, which I hadn't expected to be dispatched until tomorrow. The towel rails arrived a little later.</p>
        <p>So I painted test colours on the kitchen walls, fitted the towel rails and examined the shelf. The screws supplied were much too long for the plugs, so I found some more suitable ones. Since I may need to tap the glass into the bracket, I decided not to fit it yet. I also screwed the pieces of skirting board in place and put some filler around them.</p>
        <p>Later I phoned Alan. He had converted his works van to a camper van and has taken up cycling.</p>
