        <h1>Wednesday 16th September</h1>
        <p>A warm (low twenties), but mainly overcast day. I started by trying to cut (trim) my hair, with Angela attacking the back. It was ten o'clock befe I started to do anything and then spent most of the day drafting a note on our IET Sussex social media strategy for discussion at next weeks committee meeting. Greg emailed today saying that he wants to resign as treasurer. I've not yet replied.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch and i continued with my notes. I nearly always find that I spend a lot of time playing around with formatting and graphics. But the document does look 'pretty'.</p>
