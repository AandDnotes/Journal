        <h1>Monday 7th September</h1>
        <p>We dropped Dad's new wet razor off at Victoria Grand and then went to Wickes to buy some emulsion for the kitchen walls. We decided to then go back into Worthing to have coffee at Waitrose and buy the few things that Angela wanted.</p>
        <p>That meant that I spent a good part of the afternoon painting around the edges of the ceiling and tops of the cupboards.</p>
