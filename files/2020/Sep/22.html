        <h1>Tuesday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We overslept a little, then Angela went to the High Street to get some rolls and bread. Later in the morning she went to the hairdressers to get her hair cut. It is now much shorter.</p>
        <p>I sent the newsletter to Bernard for review, which he did quickly. So I submitted it, had it rejected due to a wrong date, corrected it and re-submitted.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put up the roof of the TC and put the cover on. Then at 3:30 I had an MS Teams meeting of the Gift Oversight Group. It only lasted for three quarters of an hour. Then, after dinner it was the Sussex Network committee meeting, this time using Zoom. That lasted a little over two hours.</p>
