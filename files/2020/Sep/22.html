        <h1>Tuesday 22nd September</h1>
        <p>A busy day. We overslept a little, then Angela went to the High Street to get some rolls and bread. Later in the morning she went to the hairdressers to get her hair cut. It is now much shorter.</p>
        <p>I sent the newsletter to Bernard for review, which he did quickly. So I submitted it, had it rejected due to a wrong date, corrected it and re-submitted. I had also updated Safari on the iMac and found that they have changed the Top Sites facility (now called the Start Page), so I had lost my links to the various sites that I often use. I had a chat with Apple Support to find out where the list of urls are stored. Using this text file I was able to add these sites to the Favourites, which are listed on the new Start Page. The MacBook Safari has not been updated.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put up the roof of the TC and put the cover on. Then at 3:30 I had an MS Teams meeting of the Gift Oversight Group. It only lasted for three quarters of an hour. Then, after dinner it was the Sussex Network committee meeting, this time using Zoom. That lasted a little over two hours.</p>
