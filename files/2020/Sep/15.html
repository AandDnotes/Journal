        <h1>Tuesday 15th September</h1>
        <p>Another glorious 'Indian Summer' day, although this week we are in a slightly tighter lockdown. We can only mix with up to six people (at a suitable distance) both indoors and outside. It doesn't really affect us, but rather than just go to Steyning High Street for a few groceries we decided to walk to Hyde Square in Beeding via the 102 steps, Clays Field, the water meadows, over the river and past St Peter's church. This is the view to Bramber Castle and the Downs from the recreation ground in Beeding. We had hoped to make a morning of it by stopping at the Castle Hotel for a coffee, but, although it was open, we couldn't find anyone to serve us! So we had quite a tiring one and a quarter hours walk.</p>
        <p>Then Angela pottered in the garden before doing some cooking, while I replied to Norman about our committee meeting agenda and finished drafting the convenor's notes for running a Zoom webinar. I sent the latter to Mike and Dave for review.</p>
