        <h1>Monday 14th September</h1>
        <p>A more relaxed day. The morning, after a slightly late shower, was spent dealing with some IET email, a couple of surveys and phoning Dad at Victoria Grand. He said he was well.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela had a WI committee meeting (over Zoom) and I tried analysing the social media survey data. I also started putting together a convenor's guide for using Zoom Webinar.</p>
        <p>So nearly all my day was spent sat in front of a computer.</p>
