        <h1>Saturday 12th September</h1>
        <p>Angela walked to the High Street to get a newspaper and some rolls while I got down to more painting. I finished giving the kitchen walls a second coat of emulsion and the touched up the white on the ceiling. I also remembered to paint the small area above one of the sockets in the dining room, but forgot to paint the  bare edges in the boiler cupboard.</p>
        <p>Angela planted a jasmine shrub in the walled garden. I had to break up a large piece of chalk that was stopping her from digging a suitable hole.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria and then I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the statement.</p>
