        <h1>Wednesday 23rd September</h1>
        <p>A lot of my day was associated with catching up from yesterday. I mainly updated the convenor's guide for delivering talks via Zoom Webinar and posted the new version to the Office 365 site.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to table tennis. Then later in the afternoon we had a FaceTime call with Juniper on her fifth birthday. She opened he card and her present. She also 'blew out' the candle on the cake that Angela had made.</p>
