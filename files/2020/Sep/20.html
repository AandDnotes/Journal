        <h1>Sunday 20th September</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I completed writing text for the September newsletter and the images that will be included.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked down to the health centre to get our flu jab. There was no queue and we were out almost before we were in. It didn't seem very warm when we left, but by the time we got to the health centre the sun was shining. When we got home we sat in the garden to drink our tea.</p>
        <p>A little later we spoke with Paul, but Rowan was too busy to say more than hello and goodbye.</p>
