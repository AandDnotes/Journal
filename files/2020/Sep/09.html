        <h1>Wednesday 9th September</h1>
        <p>I started by setting up a transfer of money from Dad's Santander account to his Barclays account. So in the morning I can pay the arrears on his rent. I also updated the standing order.</p>
        <p>Then is was back to painting. Throughout the day I managed to finish painting around the edges of everything in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her table tennis. They have split the group into two, each playing for an hour. Angela has moved to the earlier group.</p>
