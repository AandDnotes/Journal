        <h1>Thursday 24th September</h1>
        <p>We started our weekly shopping outing by going to Wickes to get some grills for the kitchen boiler cupboard and fridge/freezer cupboard. From there we went to Sainsbury's. At least, Angela did while I sat in the car. Afterwards we called into B&Q so that Angela could see if they had any indoor bulbs. But they didn't.</p>
        <p>The rest of my day was spent catching up with IET related actions. I emailed out Italian student to give him feedback and suggest what he could do now. I also scheduled a Zoom meeting for the PEI collaboration group and sent them the information that I have so far.</p>
