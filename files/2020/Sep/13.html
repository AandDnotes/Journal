        <h1>Sunday 13th September</h1>
        <p>This morning was all about putting the kitchen back together. There is still the cabinet plinths to fit and the hob splash-back. While Angela was at church, I put screws in the walls for the calendar and clock, screwed back the notice board and key hanger. I also fitted the glass shelf. This is a little disappointing in that it does not protrude at right angles to the wall. Also, it is only just large enough to hold the radio and phone.</p>
        <p>It was a warm, sunny day, with a light breeze, so after lunch we went for a walk. It was quite some time since we had walked around the upper horseshoe. It took us an hour and a quarter and we just got home by four. A little later we spoke with Paul. We also ordered Juniper's birthday present from Amazon.</p>
