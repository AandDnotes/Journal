        <h1>Thursday 10th September</h1>
        <p>This morning i dropped Angela near "Mr Brown's" and then went on to Victoria Grand. I sat inside the small lounge with Dad for half an hour, showing him some photos on the iPad. Then I went to Waitrose, where I had arranged to meet Angela for coffee. She had been looking at curtain fabric for the dining room. We then went off to Lyons Farm, where Angela did the grocery shopping and I bought some screws, wall plugs and a set of masonry bits.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela cut the grass and I started painting the kitchen walls with the new small roller. It worked well, but I didn't finish since I had a STEM Ambassador meeting at four. Afterwards I simply washed the brush and roller. The more that I look at the edges the worse they look.</p>
        <p>I also transferred the rent arrears from Dad's Barclays account to Victoria Grand and emailed them to say it was done.</p>
