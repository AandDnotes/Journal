        <h1>Sunday 27th September</h1>
        <p>Another day not doing very much except writing IET related email. I replied to Dimuth about his 'recommendation' and to the Sussex Network committee about Bernard's resignation and the vacancies we have.</p>
        <p>I also did the next section of my stop motion video and we spoke with Paul late in the day, after they got home from retrieving Rowan from the beach, where she was staying with Greet and Wim.</p>
