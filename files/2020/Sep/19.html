        <h1>Saturday 19th September</h1>
        <p>As is often the case on Saturdays, we took the long route to the High Street via the 'snake' path. We only wanted a newspaper, but all the Telegraphs had gone, so I bought a Times. It started cool, but was warm enough to wear just a sweater and was hazy sunshine for most of the day.</p>
        <p>For me, the rest of the day was spent making notes for this month's newsletter. Apart, that is, from the hour and a half that we spent talking with Victoria. She wanted to talk earlier than usual, since they were going to test drive a car; a new one for Brandon to use. It did mean that we didn't start getting our lunch until after two o'clock.</p>
