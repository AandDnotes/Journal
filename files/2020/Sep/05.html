        <h1>Saturday 5th September</h1>
        <p>The day started with a clear blue sky and only a slight chill in the air. We decided to take the long route to the High Street, via the 'snake' path. Angela bought some rolls and a baguette for lunch and our picnic tomorrow and I bought a newspaper. We had heard on the radio that there was a problem with newspaper distribution and the Telegraph was not available, so I bought a Guardian. It is surprising how you get used to the layout and content of one publication.</p>
        <p>I then did the weekly accounts and started putting a coat of gloss paint on the kitchen woodwork. Once again I thinned the paint and it flowed much better. I finished painting after we had spoken with Victoria, finishing just in time for dinner.</p>
        <p>Victoria et al are expecting their furniture to arrive tomorrow. Austin and Juniper have found online school quite difficult. There were only four children in Austin's class working from home, so if all is well they will sent them both to school next month. Meanwhile Brandon had an interesting week at his new job. He spent the first day (Tuesday) at home having video calls with various people for his induction. Then he spent three days working at the various jobs that people do in the farms so that he had a better understanding of what is involved in the business. He said it was very hard work.</p>
