        <h1>Friday 3rd January</h1>
        <p>Today was Christmas dinner day. We walked to the Tollgate for lunch, where we had three courses and coffee (in the lounge). We both had turkey breast, although the choice was very wide. It only takes twenty minutes to walk to the Tollgate from here.</p>
        <p>Prior to our outing Angela went to Steyning and I did the monthly accounts. During the afternoon I wrote and submitted an Adestra email about the change to our programme of talks in January.</p>
