        <h1>Tuesday 14th January</h1>
        <p>Angela took her lunch club cash to the bank in Storrington, by bus. It was raining and she got quite wet. Much to my surprise the door handle springs that I had ordered arrived in the post. So I fitted one to the coat cupboard door handle.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was still raining, but I went to Field Place for an RCEA talk on Operation Overlord. He was a very good speaker and an interesting talk. It was still raining at the end! When I got home I 'played' with a method of creating an html timeline.</p>
