        <h1>Wednesday 29th January</h1>
        <p>I found some phots that I took in Malaysia, scanned some and started putting them into my web page containing my collected email. I also removed the extra breaks that the conversion tool created.</p>
        <p>Angela went to table tennis after lunch. I checked over the MG and then cleaned the soffit on two sides of the garage and cleaned the garage door. I still have the soffit in the garden and along the twitten.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening we spoke with Victoria.</p>
