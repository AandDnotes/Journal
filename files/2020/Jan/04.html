        <h1>Saturday 4th January</h1>
        <p>Pretty much a standard Saturday. Angela went to buy a newspaper while I did the weekly accounts and tackled my filing tray. After lunch I found the 'springy' door stop in the garage and fitted it in bathroom. I also found that the cardboard apple box felt damp and the back (next to the wall) was mouldy. Ventilation and some water proofing solution might be in order.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria and Austin. Juniper did not say a lot.</p>
