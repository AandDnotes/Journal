        <h1>Monday 6th January</h1>
        <p>Dad seemed well and said that he had to go to have the lump on his temple removed. We checked with Julie and she said that the doctor had referred him to the Dermatology department. Victoria Grand phoned later to say that he had an appointment next Monday.</p>
        <p>We then went on to Worthing to look for marmalade oranges, but did not find any. But we did go to Sainsbury's to get the sugar needed.</p>
        <p>I booked our places at the WSMGOC annual dinner at the Tollgate in March. Otherwise we just did some odd jobs.</p>
