        <h1>Sunday 5th January</h1>
        <p>The expected dry day during which I could open the garage to help it dry out did not materialise. There was the odd break in the clouds, but this morning was fairly heavy drizzle. Nevertheless it was a fairly standard Sunday.</p>
        <p>Angela went to church and I backed up files on the laptop. One day I will need to upgrade the Essential OS since the only way to upgrade applications or the OS itself is to do a complete re-install. I also made some updates to my family history pages and listed those that need producing.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went around the corner to see Renie, a lady from church who recently came out of hospital. It sounds as though she is unable to look after herself. When she got back we spoke with Paul. They've had a quiet week, apart from going swimming.</p>
        <p>Today we took down the few Christmas decorations that we had put up.</p>
