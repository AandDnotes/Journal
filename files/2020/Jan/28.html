        <h1>Tuesday 28th January</h1>
        <p>We were late up this morning and Angela was soon off to catch the bus to Storrington to bank her WI cash and cheques. Most of the day was bright, even sunny, although the brisk breeze was cold. However, there were a few spots of rain later in the day.</p>
        <p>I didn't do anything of significance today (apart from hanging out the washing). A few email and a hunt for details of overseas trips was about it. I did find my collected email from Malaysia and started putting them on to a web page. However, we spent a lot of time during the afternoon trying to track down payments and receipts associated with Bay's estate.</p>
