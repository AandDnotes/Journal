        <h1>Sunday 12th January</h1>
        <p>We need to leave early in the morning, so we both had a shower this morning. Then, while Angela was at church I paid the window cleaner's bill, transferred 'Christmas present' money into the children's and grandchildren's accounts, did the weekly accounts, including the reconciliation against December's statement and sent V&P the marked-up calendar so that we can all start thinking about trips this spring/summer. Quite a good morning's work.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela made a rice pudding and I put the wheelchair in the car after pumping up it's tyres and those of the Panda. We then spoke with Paul. I also started work on my 'timeline' web page.</p>
        <p>It was breezy, but dry and at times sunny. So not a bad day.</p>
