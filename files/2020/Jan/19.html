        <h1>Sunday 19th January</h1>
        <p>Another clear blue sky, but with a morning frost and cool during the day. But the only time I went out was to the garage! However, Angela went to church in the morning and then went out in the late afternoon, early evening.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was pretty usual Sunday. I did my backups and tried to find why the iMac runs slowing after the upgrade to Catalina OS, but with little in the way of results. But I did create a 'Tokyo' web page linked from my 'trips' page.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. Then I emailed everyone about planning a week in North Wales during the summer.</p>
