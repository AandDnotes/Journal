        <h1>Thursday 30th January</h1>
        <p>Before we did anything, I found the LPA! It was in a cardboard box of Dad's things in an eaves cupboard!</p>
        <p>Otherwise the morning started like most Thursdays with us visiting Dad at Victoria Grand, going into Worthing to the bank and then doing our weekly groceries shop. At Barclays I managed (I hope) to change Dad's correspondence address and close his savings account. And I didn't need the LPA or the identification documents that I taken with us! However, unlike yesterday the weather was grey, misty and drizzly. In fact it stayed that way all day, even though it was reasonably mild.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the opticians for an eye test. She has ordered some slightly stronger reading glasses. I went back into Worthing to an event at Colonnade House, which was part of Adur and Worthing Council's consultation into the need for a 'maker space'. It seems that the adjoining buildings are to be demolished and the proposed plan is to create a 'digital hub' for start-up companies. The hope is to also made 'digital equipment' available to the community. This was one of a series of events to help establish the demand. They had 3-D printers and a laser cutter, which was why I went. This event was really for 'Men in Sheds', but anyone could drop in. The laser cutter (a Glowforge) would be ideal for cutting parts for the Tiger Moth. It will cut whatever is on a pdf.</p>
