        <h1>Friday 24th January</h1>
        <p>We had a day out today, although it was only to deal with some of our finances. We drove to Shoreham and caught the bus to Littlehampton. After coffee we spent three quarters of an hour standing in line in the Kent Reliance office before we were able to sit down with someone. We moved money from last year's regular saver to our notice account and opened a new regular saver account. We decided to double the amount that we put into the accounts each month.</p>
        <p>We finished our dealing at the building society just in time to go to the Fish Factory for lunch. It was good and so was about 4:15 by the time that we got home.</p>
