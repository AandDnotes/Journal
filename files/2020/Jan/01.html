        <h1>Wednesday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day 2020; the start of a new decade! We were up quite late since we were late to bed last night. My only New Year's resolution is to try to cuddle more. Angela has never been very keen on physical contact, so I must do it gradually.</p>
        <p>After breakfast and showering Angela walked to Beeding to buy some bread for lunch. Meanwhile I read the gas and electricity meters and uploaded the readings. I also attempted once again to do a temporary fix to Angela's reading glasses, using Duct Tape this time.</p>
        <p>After lunch we did more of the jigsaw puzzle. In fact we finished it before dinner. After posting a photo of it to Google Photos, Paul called to wish us a Happy New Year.</p>
        <p>Before making this entry I updated my 'journal reader' so as to include the year 2020. I'd already created the files, but needed to modify the variables so as to display the 2020 entries. Next year I'll need to add a second row of years across the top of the home page.</p>
