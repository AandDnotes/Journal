        <h1>Wednesday 1st January</h1>
        <p>New Year's Day 2020; the start of a new decade! We were up quite late since we were late to bed last night. After breakfast and showering Angela walked to Beeding to buy some bread for lunch. Meanwhile I read the gas and electricity meters and uploaded the readings. I also attempted once again to do a temporary fix to Angelas reading glasses, using Duct Tape this time.</p>
        <p>After lunch we did more of the jigsaw puzzle. In fact we finished it before dinner. After posing a photo of it, Paul called to wish us a Happy New Year.</p>
