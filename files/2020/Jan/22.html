        <h1>Wednesday 22nd January</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street while I replaced batteries in a smoke detector and did odds and ends. I also had a call from Premier Windows to fix a time to call to give an estimate for window replacement.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Wednesday, Angela went to table tennis after lunch. I modified files for the evening IET talk and started preparing images for the newsletter. In the early evening I went to Falmer for an interesting, if complex, talk on the 'security' of integrated circuits.</p>
