        <h1>Saturday 11th January</h1>
        <p>We spent most of the morning, from ten until 1:30, at Freestyle in Broadwater, helping Kevin come up with a design for our kitchen. We thought that his estimate of one to one and a half hours was long, but even after three and a half hours we had only come up with a first draft. At least we have prints of the design (and he emailed images later of the design with a few embellishments). However, we forgot about waste bins and the boiler will need to be moved (or replaced and put in a slightly different position) for that part of the design to work. We also need to decide whether or not to have the window replaced before the kitchen.</p>
        <p>After our late lunch Angela went to the Methodist Church to their beetle drive. Meanwhile I spoke briefly to Victoria before it became too dark to get in the washing.</p>
