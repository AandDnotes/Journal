        <h1>Monday 27th January</h1>
        <p>It was an early start! I collected Dad and got him to Worthing Hospital before 7:30. He had the cancerous lump removed from his left temple and I got him back to Victoria Grand at 11:15, just in time for lunch. I was then home by 12:30. I tried phoning Alan after lunch and again in the evening, but just got the answer machine.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Angela went to a food safety refresher course at the Methodist Church hall and didn't get home until about four. My afternoon was spent doing not a lot. Later, however, I did reply to Freestyle about an increase in the price of the worktop due to our second selection (the first was now unavailable). I also emailed Ron Durno in Connecticut, since I'd not done so for over a year.</p>
