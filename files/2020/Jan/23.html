        <h1>Thursday 23rd January</h1>
        <p>Not only was it a busy day, but we spent (or committed to spend) a lot of money. We started as usual, by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad and then on to Sainsbury's to do the weekly groceries shop.</p>
        <p>Usually that is the end of events on Thursdays. But today, before I went to the hygienist and then for a check-up with the dentist, we looked at the quote from Howdens and I made an appointment with Freestyle to place an order for a new kitchen. That will require a deposit as well. I then accepted the quotation from British Gas for a new boiler, paying a deposit in the process.</p>
        <p>As I was completing that, the man from Everest arrived to talk about windows. I was determined that I wouldn't place an order today and even told him that. Nevertheless we did just that, paying yet another deposit. I feel that I was coerced into placing an order by a good sales technique, even though it was the right thing to do. Their product and service are undoubtedly good and the price is not that much higher than I had estimated. Nevertheless it doesn't feel quite right.</p>
