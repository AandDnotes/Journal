        <h1>Saturday 25th January</h1>
        <p>This morning we went to Freestyle in Broadwater to order our new kitchen (with some minor modifications). That took all morning.</p>
        <p>Apart from doing the weekly accounts, we spent a lot of time trying to set up the standing orders for our regular savings accounts. Mine was fine, but Angela had changed her mobile phone number and the online system did not seem to reset it. So it took a long phone call to do so. However, I did fail to get Dad's Barclays correspondence address changed.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I did some more on the January newsletter.</p>
