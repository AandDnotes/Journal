        <h1>Friday 31st January</h1>
        <p>Today was really all about going out for lunch, on the WSMGOC pub run. I dealt with some email this morning and Angela went to the High Street. Then we took the Panda to the Worlds End at Patching, rather than the MG, since it was another wet day. There were 22 people there and it was a good lunch. We didn't leave until three o'clock</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I called TalkTalk about the 'faster fibre' discount ending in May. The set up another 18 month contract for slightly less than we are paying now. I also cancelled the 'all UK calls' 'boost'. I also did more on my 'business trips' web page.</p>
