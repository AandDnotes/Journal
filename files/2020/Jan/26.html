        <h1>Sunday 26th January</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I completed my January newsletter, replacing the previously used template for two others, one above the other. Luckily Bernard reviewed it quite quickly and I submitted it for approval. I also sent Julie an email about the problems.</p>
        <p>This afternoon I completed my trips web page, although I should be able to find information on earlier work trips. We then spoke with Paul before I went through the Everest window/door quote, marking questions. I also read the Ts&amp;Cs (very small print).</p>
