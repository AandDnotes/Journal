        <h1>Thursday 2nd January</h1>
        <p>Today we got back into our regular routine. We started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand and then did shopping. Dad couldn't make his new radio work. He hadn't read the note on his pad that said he had to press the on button! We also noticed that the lump on his temple is getting larger. Julie will ask the doctor to look at it. We also asked he to look out for his new electric razor, which we couldn't find. He gave his tin of shortbread to us and the box of assorted biscuits to Julie for the staff and residents.</p>
        <p>We then went into Worthing to look for trousers for Angela (which we didn't find) and to get a SIM card for Angela's phone. We also bought a 'soap' rack for the shower. Then it was off to Lyons Farm to do the weekly grocery shop and to buy a towel rail/rack.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch Angela went to the library and I fitted the towel rail to the bathroom wall. The wall plugs that were supplied were totaly inadequate!</p>
