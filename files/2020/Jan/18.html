        <h1>Saturday 18th January</h1>
        <p>A very tiring day. We started with a short walk to the High Street t buy a newspaper and a tin of apricots (for a planned meal), but the Coop didn't have the latter. So after lunch we walked to Beeding to look for some. However, we didn't take the direct route; we went up the twitten by our fence and down the Bostal, then across Clays Field, across the bypass, through the water meadows and over the river, then down to Hyde square. Luckily they had some, even if it was a large tin. Our route back took us up to the South Downs Way, over the river, along the Downs Link, up Clays Hill, up the Bostal and down the twitten. It took us two hours! Luckily it was a sunny day, since the sun was just setting over the Downs as we got home.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I did the weekly accounts, paid Dad's newspaper bill and did some more to my 'timeline' web page.</p>
        <p>Following our walk and after making a pot of tea we spoke with Victoria. While waiting for her to call I sent her and Paul another suggestion for a place to get together in the summer; Brittany. However, she favours North Wales. We must see if we can persuade Paul and Brandon. Brandon would like to go to the Lakes and Paul would like to go somewhere sunny.</p>
