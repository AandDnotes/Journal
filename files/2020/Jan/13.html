        <h1>Monday 13th January</h1>
        <p>We had a relatively early start to take Dad to his appointment at Worthing hospital outpatients for someone to look at the growth on his temple. They decided that they needed to refer him to the Maximo Facial unit, since there will not be enough skin to pull over the hole. We were actually early and had finished before his appointment was due. So we got him back to Victoria Grand by about ten thirty.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela collected the cash from the lunch club and then went to her WI committee meeting. Later, I went to the WSMGOC meeting in West Chiltington. It was a wild, windy and wet evening.</p>
