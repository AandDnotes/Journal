        <h1>Tuesday 21st January</h1>
        <p>We had a fairly early start, going into Worthing for Angela to bank her WI cash. We then went to Freestyle to go through the quotation for the kitchen.</p>
        <p>After lunch I contacted two window suppliers about replacing our windows. Later in the afternoon I went to the IET committee meeting. Actually I went to Bernard's and he drove to Crawley. I was home just before ten.</p>
