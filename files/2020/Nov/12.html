        <h1>Thursday 12th November</h1>
        <p>Supermarket shopping day, but today, in the second week of lockdown, Angela went on her own. Meanwhile, I did more of my arrangements for IET Sussex speakers.</p>
        <p>I then tried to get a Windows program to run on a Mac by installing Wine and WineBottle. However, the latest version does not support running under Catalina. So I tried installing them on the Air, which runs High Sierra. This allowed the program to be installed and to run, but it would not access the USB port.</p>
        <p>Later I spoke with Dad. He was well and as busy as ever!</p>
        <p>Later still we watched a film, On the Town, with gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.</p>
