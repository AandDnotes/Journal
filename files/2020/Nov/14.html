        <h1>Saturday 14th November</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day, mainly spent in front of a computer screen. While Angela went to the High Street to get a newspaper and some rolls, I did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the bank statement, and then watched the third episode of Graeme Awcock's talks on two of Saturn's moons. I have arranged to have a Zoom meeting with him in the morning.</p>
        <p>Over the day I also made notes for much of November's newsletter.</p>
        <p>Just after lunch we had a call with Victoria. Austin's class has been sent home, since someone in the class has tested positive for covid-19. So Victoria has taken Juniper out of school also, Brandon is working from home and Austin has been for a test. The results are due on Monday.</p>
