        <h1>Friday 6th November</h1>
        <p>Today was really only about two things; dealing with Tuesday's talk recording and going for a walk. Although it started frosty, it was mostly sunny with little in the way of a breeze. So it was ideal for a walk.</p>
        <p>I spent quite some time downloading, editing and uploading the recording. Having completed the edit, exporting it as a 720p file from iMovie and uploading it to YouTube I discovered that my new file was nearly three times the size of the original 1080p file! So I ran the new file through Handbrake and that  reduced it to less than half the original size. But that meant deleting the up loaded file (and the link on our web site) and then uploading the new file.</p>
        <p>After lunch, and in between sorting out the recording, we went for a walk. It was ideal weather, but we only went up the twitten, up the snake path and then back down to the end of the lower horseshoe.</p>
        <p>At about eight o'clock Juniper called on FaceTimed. Luckily Angela spent most of the time with her.</p>
