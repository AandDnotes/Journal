        <h1>Thursday 5th November</h1>
        <p>A fairly inactive day. It was veery misty from the start, and cold. The mist was just clearing when the sun went down behind the trees and the mist descended again.</p>
        <p>I spent quite some time trying to find images that relate to my past jobs, but I didn't keep very good records and it is difficult to find when things happened.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I phoned Dad. He says that his radio has disappeared and he is using the old one that stops.</p>
        <p>The recording of Tuesday's talk arrived and I started trying to edit out the first part, when Mike's sound was not working. He also sent me the BBC news clip, which I will try to replace in the recording.</p>
