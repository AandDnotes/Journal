        <h1>Tuesday 24th November</h1>
        <p>The morning was mainly spent preparing for upcoming talks. I prepared the start slide and made introductory notes. This included preparing an image for the first talk in January. I now just need to mail the speaker.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk in the sunshine. It was quite mild and the wind was light. We went across Clays Field and down the Downs Link to the river. Then back through Bramber and up the 'cows' field.</p>
        <p>This evening was an IET Sussex committee meeting. We managed to get through the agenda in two 40-minute Zoom sessions.</p>
