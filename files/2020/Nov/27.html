        <h1>Friday 27th November</h1>
        <p>We started by walking to the High Street to go to the butchers. Angela stayed outside and I went in. I spent the rest of the morning modifying the Sussex event programme in the blog page and the home page, including changing the banner photo on all pages.</p>
        <p>Later I emailed our speaker for Tuesday and the committee about dates for meetings. I also added image and text display on my test module, installed Python 3 on the Pi and got my test Python module working on it.</p>
