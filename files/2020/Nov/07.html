        <h1>Saturday 7th November</h1>
        <p>A much busier day today. It was another fine day, sunny and little wind. We started with a short walk to the High Street. Angela bought a newspaper, some rolls, a lettuce and some fruit in the Coop so that we only had to go into one shop. When we got home I did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. As has become the norm, Juniper took the iPad off to show us her soft toys. While talking about Pluto, a voice from the upper bunk bed pointed out that Pluto was not a planet, but a dwarf planet.</p>
        <p>I'd put the mower's battery on to charge before we went out, so I was able to cut the front grass and part of the kitchen garden. The grass was very wet, but cut easily. I then checked the TC. The plugs were quite sooty, so I weekend the mixture a little and then took a photo of the front springs bump stop. Afterwards I was able to finish cutting the grass.</p>
