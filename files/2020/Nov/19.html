        <h1>Thursday 19th November</h1>
        <p>Dad's 97th birthday. We started by driving to Lyons Farm, where I left Angela to do the supermarket shopping while I went to visit Dad. It was Victoria Grand's first day for visits. I went into the small lounge from the outside where there were two pull-up screens between two chairs. I had my temperature taken and filled in a form. Then Dad arrived. Walking that far seemed a bit of an effort, but he looked well. I had taken the iPad and so was able to show him photos of his great grandchildren. I also took him some packs of sweets.</p>
        <p>We also bought a small Christmas tree in a pot, although we had to transfer it to a slightly larger pot so as to straighten it up.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's speaker sent a copy of his slides, which I uploaded. Then I rebuilt the blog post about the Saturn moon talks.</p>
