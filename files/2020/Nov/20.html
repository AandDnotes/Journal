        <h1>Friday 20th November</h1>
        <p>Angela walked to the butchers before it started raining. Unfortunately I did not clean out the front gutters at the same time. It rained for the rest of the day!</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning tidying up files and email on the iMac and preparing for Tuesday's IET committee meeting. Then, after lunch, I made some bread and tried to make some soda bread from a packed. It was over a year out of date and so, after all my mixing and kneading it did not rise. So it went in the bin!</p>
