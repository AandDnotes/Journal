        <h1>Saturday 28th November</h1>
        <p>Since it was Saturday we started by walking to the High Street. Again, Angela stayed outside the shops and I went into the newsagents and the bakers.</p>
        <p>I then 'played' with some Python code, with only a little success. I need to understand the structure fo a program. I also made more notes for my recording of my jobs, at least the RR job.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with both Victoria and Paul, at the same time.</p>
