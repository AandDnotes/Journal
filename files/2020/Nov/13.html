        <h1>Friday 13th November</h1>
        <p>Angela went down to the High Street, but I didn't get further than the garage. I thought that while we were having lunch would be a good time to upgrade the iMac's OS. However, I started it off at about 12:15 and it was finally finished at 3:45. Admittedly the update was waiting for me to log out Angela and then to be restarted, so it didn't really take all that time. So now we have moved from MacOS Catalina to Big Sur.</p>
        <p>I organised giving our Sussex IET members access to Graeme Awcock's talks between Christmas and the New Year. Now I just have to make it happen. I also spent some time measuring the height of the TC's chassis arch and the top and bottom of the wheel hub. It didn't help. The distances don't tie up with those on the dimensional drawing of the TC.</p>
