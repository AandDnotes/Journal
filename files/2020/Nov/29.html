        <h1>Sunday 29th November</h1>
        <p>I seemed to spend a lot of the day trying to figure out how to make an image rotate in python, but with limited success. Angela joined her Zoom church service this morning and after lunch we went for a walk. We didn't need to talk with Paul today, since they were going out. So we walked around the 'extended block'. It stayed grey all day and didn't quite get to 10 degrees, but there was no wind.</p>
