        <h1>Monday 16th November</h1>
        <p>My day started, quite late, by emailing tomorrow's speaker to check that he had received the link. Luckily he has. Then I put together the grandchildren's paintings and drawings to make two birthday cards for Dad, which Angela later posted. Later in the day, before I spoke with him, I also arranged to visit him on Thursday, the first day of visits to Victoria Grand. I will drop Angela at Sainsbury's and then go into Worthing.</p>
        <p>The rest of my day was spent compiling the November IET Sussex newsletter. As always it took quite a while to build it in Adestra. So I now have a test email to check. It lacks the report on tomorrow's talk and a link to a planned blog page about the Saturnian talks.</p>
        <p>In the evening Angela had church meeting via Zoom.</p>
