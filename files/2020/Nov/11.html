        <h1>Wednesday 11th November</h1>
        <p>Armistice day. So at two o'clock we had a two minutes silence, in addition to the one on Sunday. It was a dry, warm, but overcast day with little in the way of wind.</p>
        <p>It was mainly a day for dealing with IET things. I emailed my December speaker, sending him the permissions form, and the committee about the offer from Graeme Awcock. I also modified my start slide for next week's talk.</p>
        <p>Finally, I updated the Linux system and started experimenting with getting a Windows application to run on the Mac. I copied a setup program from a CD and transferred it to the iMac.</p>
