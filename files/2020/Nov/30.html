        <h1>Monday 30th November</h1>
        <p>It was ten o'clock before we (or I) got going this morning, but then most of the remains of the morning was spent dealing with email, although I did do my Dutch lessons. We then had an early lunch so that we could go off to Worthing for Angela's audiology appointment. We were a little early, so I parked in Waitrose and Angela walked to the hospital, while I joined the queue to go into the shop.</p>
        <p>The queue soon went down. I was only buying a few things, so when I got back to the car I had time to phone Dad. It then wasn't long before Angela got back.</p>
        <p>When back home I spent some time making notes about my time at RR&amp;A.</p>
