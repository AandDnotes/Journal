        <h1>Wednesday 25th November</h1>
        <p>All I did today, apart from the usual Dutch lessons, was associated with IET email and tasks. Some were as a result of yesterday evening's committee meeting and some were related to speakers, including mods to the convenor's guide for Zoom webinars. I don't think Angela went out either, but she did sort out yesterday's washing.</p>
