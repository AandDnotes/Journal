        <h1>Monday 23rd November</h1>
        <p>Another day not doing very much. Angela walked to the High Street, but I didn't poke my head out of the door.</p>
        <p>I started making notes on my latest project, making a Raspberry Pi talk to a BBC micro:bit. A lot of that time was spent finding and preparing images.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I joined the 'Eurotherm' group chat for forty minutes.</p>
