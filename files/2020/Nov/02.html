        <h1>Monday 2nd November</h1>
        <p>Quite a tiring day. Angela went out just before me this morning, to a 'coffee morning' at Phylis's, because it was her 80th birthday. I then left at 10:30 and went to Kithurst Hill car park, just the other side of Storrington, to meet up with the Eurotherm 'London walkers'. Nine of us did a six and a half mile circular walk, stopping for lunch part way round. Luckily the weather was fine, in fact sunny most of the time, but with a very strong wind. We kept to the 'rule of six' by dividing into small groups on the walk. I got home, feeling very weary, at five past three to find that Angela was out. She had gone to the library and to collect some papers from the WI President. So I phoned Dad.</p>
