        <h1>Saturday 21st November</h1>
        <p>It was dry this morning, if overcast and breezy. So we took our usual walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper and rolls. We then took the long route home via the lower horseshoe, the first walk this week.</p>
        <p>I then cleaned out the front gutter. It had no leaves in it, but there were quite a few sycamore seeds around the top of the down pipes. We also moved the wheelie bins to the side of the garage.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was time to do the weekly accounts before we spoke with Victoria, which took two hours!</p>
