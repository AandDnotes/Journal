        <h1>Sunday 22nd November</h1>
        <p>It was dry, calm, but overcast, but I'm not really sure what happened to today. Angela had a Zoom church service this morning and I tried to find out why my python code wouldn't work, but to no avail. I did, however, start making notes on my Pi/micro:bit project.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
