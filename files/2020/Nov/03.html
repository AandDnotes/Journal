        <h1>Tuesday 3rd November</h1>
        <p>I spent quite a bit of the morning doing the monthly accounts and renewing a savings bond. I also took up a rights issue for some Rolls Royce shares. The original shares have been disastrous, but these were being sold at a discount. I also cleared away my micro:bit project and helped Angela set up her WI accounts spreadsheet for the coming year.</p>
        <p>We had an early dinner since I was convenor for an IET talk. Mike Underhill was giving the talk, but it took over an hour to get his sound working. Even then he had to turn down his speakers and so couldn't hear us! So we started 45 minutes late and I had to relay the questions to him via the phone. The numbers dropped from over 200 to 165 by the time we started. Then, towards the end of the questions, he lost his internet, so we had to finish with me relaying the answers.</p>
