        <h1>Tuesday 10th November</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the morning watching Graeme Awcock's videos on Saturn's moons, then a lot of time dealing with the next couple of IET talks, for both of which I'm the convenor.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went for a walk, across and up the rifle range. It was a mild, calm day.</p>
