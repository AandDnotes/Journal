        <h1>Sunday 15th November</h1>
        <p>Another changeable day, weather-wise. It was quite windy and oscillated between storms and sunshine. We even had a flash of lightening, shortly followed by a thunder clap.</p>
        <p>I started with a short Zoom call with Graeme Awcock about his talks on Saturn's moons. Then Angela had a Zoom church service. Then, on and off during the day, I continued drafting the November newsletter. However, things kept getting in the way, like an email conversation with Graeme, totting up the words in my thesis, having a FaceTime call with Paul and Rowan and a short FaceTime call with Juniper and Austin. So I still haven't quite finished drafting it. Then I have to put it into Adestra.</p>
