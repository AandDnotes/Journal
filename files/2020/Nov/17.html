        <h1>Tuesday 17th November</h1>
        <p>I started by checking the draft November newsletter, which included setting up a blog page to act as a link target, before sending a test copy to Graeme to check the part about his talks. Then most of the day was spent preparing a web page draft of the blog post. I need to put it somewhere where Graeme can check it.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I stayed inside. Angela went to the post box (via the twitten) and did two lots of washing, plus some ironing.</p>
        <p>In the evening I ran the IET talk on Blockchain. We had 190 attendees and too many questions to get through, but I fear that it wasn't recorded.</p>
