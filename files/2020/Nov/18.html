        <h1>Wednesday 18th November</h1>
        <p>Following yesterday's IET talk on blockchain I discovered that it had not been recorded. However, I was able to finish the November newsletter. Angela checked it and and I submitted it for approval, which Julie did a little later. I emailed our thanks to the speaker, who replied later with a pdf version of his slides.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I walked down to the sweet chop and bought five packets of Werther's Original for Dad, which I can take to him tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Following some comments from Graeme (all but one modifying his text) I updated my mock-up of the blog page. Now I should be able to copy it into the actual blog page. I also installed the latest version of Python on the MacBook Air and started looking at some of the beginner's documents.</p>
