        <h1>Thursday 26th November</h1>
        <p>A more productive day today. Since Angela is due to have her day surgery on her ears in less than two weeks, she needs to avoid contact as much as possible. So I took her shopping list to Sainsbury's and was home by 10:30, even if it was in the drizzle.</p>
        <p>Later Angela went for a walk and, in addition to the usual email, I finished building an events list on a blog page.</p>
