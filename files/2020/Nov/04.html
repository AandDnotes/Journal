        <h1>Wednesday 4th November</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Since a National lockdown starts tomorrow and we wanted to get some photos printed, we decided to bring forward our weekly groceries shop to today. So I went to Boots to get some prints of the grandchildren to give to Dad, while Angela went into Sainsbury's. I caught up with her and we stopped for coffee after the shop. So it was almost lunch time by the time we got home and unpacked.</p>
        <p>After lunch I took the TC for my usual figure of eight route. The car took a lot of turning over to get it to start, whereas it usually starts very quickly. Once started it seemed fine and the acceleration and speed were fine, easily getting up to 50 mph on the Steyning bypass. I must check the choke connection. I will also need to check the plugs to see if the engine is still running rich.</p>
        <p>As I arrived home so Angela went off to get more bank statements signed and then to go to table tennis.</p>
        <p>As we sat down with a cup of coffee after dinner so we had a FaceTime call from Juniper. They had no school this afternoon and she wanted us to play with her. We did some drawing with her for about an hour.</p>
