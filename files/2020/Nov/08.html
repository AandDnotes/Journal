        <h1>Day/date</h1>
        <p>We seem to have a busy day, followed by a relaxing day. Today was more relaxed. While Angela joined her Zoom church service I sorted some files and found some batch control images. I found that my attempt to photograph the TC's front bump stop was not very successful, so I went out to the garage to try again.</p>
        <p>As usual we spoke to Paul et al later in the afternoon. Otherwise it was a case of reading the paper.</p>
