        <h1>Monday 9th November</h1>
        <p>It was mainly a day sat in front of a screen, although I did modify the fixing of the fridge door to the cupboard door. It is better, but still not quite straight.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned Dad. He still hasn't found his radio.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Angela had a WI committee meeting and I was invited to a 'Eurotherm' chat, at the same time. So Angela used the iMac and I sat downstairs with the Air. I found that Zoom run in Safari cannot play sound, so I had to download the Zoom app. Meanwhile, the WI President could not not get the Zoom meeting started. So we didn't find out if our broadband connection can cope with two Zoom meetings running together.</p>
        <p>I discovered that my speaker for next week has not received a link to the Zoom meeting, so I emailed Julie. I also mailed Greg about preparing to use Zoom.</p>
