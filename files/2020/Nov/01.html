        <h1>Sunday 1st November</h1>
        <p>Yesterday it was announced that we will be in lockdown again from Thursday for a month. So our outings this week (my walk on Monday and Angela's table tennis on Wednesday) will be the last for a while. Angela went to church, while I read the meters and played with the micro:bit.</p>
        <p>At lunchtime were were interrupted by a FaceTime call from Juniper and Austin who wanted us to see their show and join in their 'games'. As usual this was really them prancing around, following some plot from a TV show.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul (and a little with Rowan) and then I got my toy car timing gates working. I made a short video of it working, with the intention of adding another page to my 'notebook'.</p>
