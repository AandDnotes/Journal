        <h1>Monday 25th May</h1>
        <p>Spring bank holiday, sunshine from start to finish and warmer than yesterday. After talking to Dad (via FaceTime) our walk was intended to be less strenuous, heading in the direction of the river, although we did start by going up the twitten. We walked around the castle, finding the car park full. By the mobile home park (near St Mary's House) we found a 'nature' board that told us the orchids we found yesterday are, in fact, Common Spotted, not Pyramidal.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela continued in the garden and I continued cleaning the gutters and facias, although I didn't quite finish.</p>
