        <h1>Tuesday 26th May</h1>
        <p>Sunshine from rise to set, although there was some high, wispy cloud during the afternoon. This morning we took the long route to the High Street, via the Rifle Range and Mouse Lane. Angela wanted to get one or two things from the Coop. When we got home I finished cleaning the facias, at least as far as I can reach. After lunch I cut the grass and cleared weeds from a small part of the drive. A wire brush seems reasonably effective, although it takes some time and effort. Today was hot and the first day of the year that I ventured into shorts!</p>
