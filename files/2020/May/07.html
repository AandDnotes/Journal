        <h1>Thursday 7th May</h1>
        <p>We were fairly early for our weekly visit to the supermarket. This week there was a short queue, but again I sat in the car and phoned Dad. They are still unable to get any testing kits, but everyone in Victoria Grand is well. I then read until Angela came out and we were home by eleven.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked our extended round the block. It was a very warm and sunny day today. I then put photos taken on our walks into a web page. I just need to decide where to put it.</p>
        <p>This week, at eight o'clock, Brian next door played 'We'll Meet Again' on his trumpet.</p>
        <p>My loaf again sank in the middle, even though it rose up to the window and I used only white and wholemeal flour (not including any brown). The only difference is the yeast.</p>
