        <h1>Saturday 9th May</h1>
        <p>Another hot, sunny day. We again took the long route to the High Street to go to the bakers, butchers and the Co-op (for grapes and a newspaper). We got home about eleven. The rest of the morning was spent dealing with email and doing the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>Angela again pottered in the garden and later we had a three-way FaceTime call with Victoria and paul. The video and sound quality was very good. They tried to set up a drawing game, but only Rowan and Austin could join. They seemed to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Just as we were starting the call so our new mower arrived. When we finished the call I assembled the mower and charged the battery. After dinner I finished mowing the walled garden grass and nearly finished the front grass before the battery ran out! It should last for twice the size of our total grass area. So I charged it for a short while and then finished off the mowing. Later I registered the mower, charger and battery, needing information from the 'plates' on all three items.</p>
