        <h1>Wednesday 13th May</h1>
        <p>A lazy day, at least for me. It was chilly and windy, so, apart from Angela visiting a WI friend and the post box, we did not go for a walk.</p>
        <p>I printed a template for a face mask and Angela made one. I left out a sentence from the instructions! Which didn't help. Even so it took quite a lot of effort.</p>
        <p>I spent some time on the RC system. I soldered a pin on two leads and adjusted the output of the voltage regulator. I also spent a lot of time finding the USB cable for the FDTI board. It was plugged into the laptop FD drive in the desk draw!</p>
