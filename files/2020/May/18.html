        <h1>Monday 18th May</h1>
        <p>It was a gloriously sunny day today and the breeze, although brisk, was warm. We were quite late getting going, but decided to take a more gentle walk down to the river. However, we started and finished with our 102 steps! We went across Clays Field, up the path next to the castle and then back along The Street. Since it was about 11:30 before we were back, there wasn't much time before lunch. I started cutting the grass, but the battery ran out part-way through. So I had to recharge it over lunch and finish the grass later.</p>
        <p>The postman arrived as we were leaving for our walk, delivering the cable that I had ordered. So once I'd put the mower battery on charge I set up the DAB tuner. We now have DAB radio, with a clear reception for local radio, in the sitting room using the hi-fi.</p>
        <p>The rest of the afternoon was spent reading, posting photos of our walk (including another panorama) and drafting an email to the IMechE, which I finished off later in the evening.</p>
