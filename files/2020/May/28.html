        <h1>Thursday 28th May</h1>
        <p>Apart from a walk to the Post Office and back I didn't have any exercise today. We set off quite early to do the weekly supermarket shop. There was no queue and I was able to phone Dad from the car park. He said that he had been tested for Covid-19. It will be interesting to see how long it takes for them to get the results. So we were home before eleven. A little later my new RF module and Arduino arrived, but we we spent a while setting up a 'wigwam' for the runner beans from a length of plastic drain pipe, some string and some wire pegs. We just hope it is not too windy!</p>
        <p>After lunch I walked to the Post Office and ordered a patio brush. Angela continued pottering in the garden and I soldered connectors to the Arduino, checked that it worked and then that the RF module responded to the Arduino via the SPI interface.</p>
