        <h1>Thursday 14th May</h1>
        <p>I phoned Dad from the Sainsbury's car park while Angela queued to get into the shop. I had left her and gone back to get some petrol. We hadn't used much over the past month and the tank was still half full, so I was a little concerned that the gauge/float might be stuck. However, it was fine and at Â£1.01/l it was a relatively cheap fill. Angela was not long and we were home by 11:30.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the afternoon on the phone to various people. Whereas I tried to connect to the Arduino Pro Mini, without success. I also spoke with Mike Underhill about his proposed talk via Zoom.</p>
