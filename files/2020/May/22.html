        <h1>Friday 22nd May</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day. It was mainly overcast, but with quite a strong, blustery wind and only a few spots of rain. Angela went to the butchers (starting by going up the twitten) and I went for an 'extended round the block' walk later in the day.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, Angela did some vacuuming and did a little in the garden, while I 'played' with Arduino editors. I found reference to a more sophisticated editor, so investigated what is available. There is a 'light' version of MS Visual Studio, with an extension for Aduino and also a package for Atom (PlatformIO).</p>
        <p>So I installed Visual Studio Code on the iMac and added the extension. I eventually managed to download a sketch and, after changing the serial port baud rate, managed to get the Serial Monitor working, but the interface is poor. I also installed the Atom package and downloaded a sketch, but I haven't yet tried the Serial Monitor. I also found some toolbar extensions.</p>
