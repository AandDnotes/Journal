        <h1>Monday 4th May</h1>
        <p>Another pretty unproductive day. I phoned Dad for a brief chat. The care home manager had not been able to obtain/book any tests, even after spending two hours trying on the computer. Angela had the washing machine going before breakfast and we went out for a walk after coffee, getting home in time to make lunch. We did an anti-clockwise extended round the block route. It seemed hard today, getting up the Horseshoe path.</p>
        <p>After lunch I spent an hour doing one Dutch lesson! I just kept getting the wrong word order on separable verbs. The second lesson only took 15 minutes and so I then put together an email to the STEM manager at Thales. However, her auto-reply said that she had been furloughed.</p>
        <p>Another loaf of bread had a big dip in the top, even though it had risen to the touch the window in the top of the bread maker. I'd put more yeast in, so I'll try leaving out the brown flour next time. It might be too heavy.</p>
