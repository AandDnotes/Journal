        <h1>Saturday 30th May</h1>
        <p>As we often do on Saturday, we took the long route to the High Street, via the twitten, the Bostal and Newham Lane, then across the cricket field. What has also become somewhat of a ritual, we bought bread rolls at the Model Bakery, meat at the butchers and a newspaper from the newsagent. There was quite a queue at the butchers, so, in spite of walking up to the newsagents, I had quite a wait while Angela queued. Luckily it was another warm, hot even, and sunny day.</p>
        <p>For me, the rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and looking up the dividend for Reckitt Benckiser. Later I used my oscilloscope to look at the signal from the Arduino to the servos. To my surprise, one output had no signal, while the other had a negative pulse followed by a positive pule. The first was for one servo and the second for the other, even though they should have been on separate outputs!</p>
        <p>We also had our usual chat with Victoria. Towards the end (after nearly two hours) Austin got up and showed us his drone.</p>
