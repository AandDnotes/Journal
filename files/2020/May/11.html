        <h1>Monday 11th May</h1>
        <p>It was very windy overnight and the temperature has dropped considerably. We were late getting going after breakfast, a shower and my exercises, but after a long walk yesterday (and the weather) we did not go for a walk today. Instead I tackled email and reconciled the accounts against the bank statement that arrived this morning.</p>
        <p>After lunch I fitted a power strip to the wall under the desk in the study and later moved the router (and boiler hub) upstairs. After dinner we tried watching a catchup programme to check that the wi-fi was adequate.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we had a quick chat with the birthday boy in Davis. He was still eating breakfast, but took our present out of a Christmas carrier bag! Our parcel, with the birthday cards, had not arrived.</p>
