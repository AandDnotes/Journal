        <h1>Friday 29th May</h1>
        <p>Another hot, sunny day. As usual we were late getting going, so Angela 'pottered' in the garden, planting pots and baskets, and I 'played' with my RF equipment. I managed to get it working (the main problem was the connections to the servos) and one servo did not respond to commands, but was erratically uncontrolled. I verified that the correct data was being received and, mostly the transmission was working. However, when I decided to video the equipment with just one servo working, that servo stopped!</p>
        <p>After an early dinner we walked around the lower horseshoe path, starting by going across the cricket field.</p>
