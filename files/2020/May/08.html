        <h1>Saturday 8th May</h1>
        <p>The 75th anniversary of VE day, Rowan's birthday and a sunny, hot day with hardly any wind. It was also quite a busy day. We hung out a strip of Union Jack bunting across the garage and then did our usual extended around the block walk. We were back in time to watch the two minutes silence on the TV. We also found that the window cleaners had been while we were out, so I had to pay them online. Then we had a FaceTime call with Rowan. She was showing off her swingball game in the garden. She also collects 'hatchlings', and was given a 'eggbox' of about ten 'eggs'. She showed us how her 'cracking machine' opened an egg to get out a hatchling.</p>
        <p>After lunch I got out the mower and cut the kitchen garden grass. It was smelling and stopped half way through the cutting the walled garden grass. When I stripped it down last week I couldn't find anything wrong, so just cleaned and lubricated it. I then spent some time trying to find a new, cordless one that didn't cost too much and could be delivered quickly. I ended up buying a Ryobi model with a 33cm cut (the old one was 37cm), which should be delivered tomorrow afternoon.</p>
        <p>Later I uploaded my web page of photos taken on our walks and linked it to the 'pandemics' page of my ROM site.</p>
