        <h1>Sunday 3rd May</h1>
        <p>Not a very productive day. We started with a walk, intending to go to the river. We went up the twitten and down the Bostal for a change, then through Clays Field and along the Downs Link in the direction of the river. However, we diverted off towards the mobile home park in Bramber and then explored Bramber Brooks Nature Reserve. A lot of work has been done since we were last there, with mown paths and wooden bridges over swampy areas. However, unless you go towards the river you have to exit the way you go in, opposite St Mary's house. We were out for one and a half hours, so were tired by the tie we got home.</p>
        <p>So we spent the rest of the morning reading Saturday's newspaper. I did reply to my '5G' speaker, but otherwise we spoke briefly to Paul. He tried (and failed) to organise a three-way call with Victoria. They had arranged a to play a game with some friends over a video link, so we will try talking tomorrow.</p>
