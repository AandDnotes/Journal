        <h1>Friday 1st May</h1>
        <p>There were heavy showers for most of the morning, so we had a latish start and stayed inside. I phoned Mike Underhill about resurrecting our June talk via Zoom. He will contact the speaker. For some reason I had a lot of email today and so spent the rest of the morning dealing with them. I also started contacting speakers again, asking for details for the programme booklet.</p>
        <p>After lunch I joined a STEM video session. Their Adobe Connect system would only allow 25 people on the call, but they needed about 80! So they spent half an hour moving across to MS Teams. By the time the email arrived and Teams had started up they were part-way through! Overall it wasn't very useful.</p>
        <p>Then it was back to emailing speakers or trying to contact speakers.</p>
