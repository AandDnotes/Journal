        <h1>Friday 15th May</h1>
        <p>Angela needed to deliver a cheque to the Steyning Centre, so we decided to take the 'long' route. We went around the lower horseshoe, finding the results of the ash tree felling that had taken place. It was a scene of devastation! We were out for over an hour and so it was 11:30 by the time we got home. Luckily it was clear blue sky, with a gentle breeze.</p>
        <p>While Angela worked in the garden, I prepared an Adestra email about our planned Zoom talk and sent test versions to Mike and Dave for review. I also created a panoramic photo from two that I'd taken while out for a walk. I posted that and one of the photos of the tree cutting and added an entry on my 'lockdown walks' web page.</p>
