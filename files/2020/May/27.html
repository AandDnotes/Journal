        <h1>Wednesday 27th May</h1>
        <p>Yet another warm, sunny day, perhaps with just a little more high cloud at times. We started with a walk around our 'extended around the block' route. I then spent some time 'playing' with drawing apps. I decided to stick with Inkscape and updated it to the 'native' MacOS version. I did, however, spend half an hour cleaning another small part of the dive. Angela continued pottering in the garden.</p>
        <p>After some more 'playing' I did a little more cleaning of the drive.</p>
