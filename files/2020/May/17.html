        <h1>Sunday 17th May</h1>
        <p>We started by walking around the upper horseshoe, stopping on our departure to talk to Brian about his drive cleaning. He was not impressed and thought they hd been 'ripped of'. As we came out of the woods on the western side of the horseshoe we followed a path steeply downwards that came out on to the lower horseshoe path. We were out for about one and a half hours. Although it started sunny, by the time we came out of the woods at the top of the horseshoe it was starting to cloud over. The rest of the morning was spent reading the paper. We also had a call from Alan. They are all well and he had just spoken with Dad.</p>
        <p>After lunch I levelled the old water butt by the garage. It may now be a little high to fill from the down-pipe. We then spoke with Paul.</p>
