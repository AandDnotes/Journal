        <h1>Saturday 2nd May</h1>
        <p>A sunny, if breezy, day. So we took the long route to the High Street, via the twitten, Newham Lane and the cricket field. We bought some bread rolls (the loaf I made yesterday was not very good), Angela bought some meat and I went to the newsagents for a paper.</p>
        <p>I spent the rest of the morning (and part of the afternoon) reading the paper and doing the weekly and monthly accounts. At the usual time we spent about two hours talking with Victoria. Juniper was screaming because she wanted to watch something on TV, so Victoria gave in again. We had taken the precaution of having our main meal at lunch-time!</p>
        <p>I also ported another TC article.</p>
