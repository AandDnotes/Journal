        <h1>Sunday 31st May</h1>
        <p>Another hot, sunny day. However, we had a day off from our walks. Angela did more pottering in the garden, although I think she has now planted out everything she has. I decided to add a switch to the power input to the oscilloscope, but then it wouldn't work at all. I removed the switch, but still no luck. It seems that the power gets as far as the first diode, but no further. I can measure a stable forward voltage on the diode, but I can only assume it has failed. I spent some time trying to find a two-pin plug that would fit the alternative power input, which may be easier than the cylindrical connector.</p>
        <p>As usual we spoke with Paul and Rowan. They were sat outside. Tomorrow is another holiday for them.</p>
