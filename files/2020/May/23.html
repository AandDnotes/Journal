        <h1>Saturday 23rd may</h1>
        <p>A breezy and mainly overcast day, we started with a walk to the High Street, the long way. We started by going up the twitten, up the Bostal Road, down Newham Lane and through the cricket field to the bottom of the High Street. We only bought some bread rolls and a newspaper.</p>
        <p>For me, the rest of the morning was spent doing the weekly accounts and trying to solve the 'prize puzzle' in the May edition of E&T. I eventually finished it after lunch and sent it off, although I fear that I am a day too late.</p>
        <p>I also played with the Arduino extension to Atom, finally getting it to compile a sketch and upload it to an Arduino. However, both it and the VS Code editor are too complicated and give no benefits over the Arduino IDE.</p>
        <p>Later int e afternoon we spoke with Victoria. Austin and Juniper were not interested, although they were perhaps still recovering from spending the night in their tent in the garden!</p>
