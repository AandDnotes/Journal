        <h1>Sunday 10th May</h1>
        <p>This morning we went for the longest walk of the lockdown so far (about 5&frac12; kilometres). We went up the twitten (102 steps), up the Bostal Road, up the Horseshoe path, over Round Hill (180m) to the South Downs Way, down Sopers Lane (past the end of Kingsmead Close) and back along to the Bostal. Then down the twitten. We sat down for the rest of the day!</p>
        <p>It became cloudier, cooler and windier as the day went on. In fact it rained during the afternoon. I only managed one Dutch lesson, since I got so many questions wrong, repeatedly. Otherwise there was a lot of reading of the paper.</p>
