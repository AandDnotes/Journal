        <h1>Tuesday 12th May</h1>
        <p>Yesterday we had a rest from walking because we did a long walk on Sunday and the weather was cold and very windy. So this morning we decided to do 'not too energetic' walk. However, once we had reached the top of the Rifle Range we decided to carry on up to the Upper Horseshoe path. It was a long climb! Then when we reached the gate to come down we found the normally docile cattle around it , quite agitated and being very vocal. We decided to carry on to the South Downs Way and saws that a van and trailer was in the next field, so the cattle probably thought they were about to get some food.</p>
        <p>However, it was a very clear day. From the top we could see the wind farm and the i360 on the promenade in Brighton. It was then nearly 11:30 before we got home and so by the time we had sat in the garden to have a mug of coffee it was midday.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was spent sending email, reading the paper and checking the breadboard connections on the ground station of my transceivers. In other words, all sitting down activities.</p>
