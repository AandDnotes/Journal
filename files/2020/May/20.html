        <h1>Wednesday 20th May</h1>
        <p>The day started as forecast, clear blue sky, little breeze and warm. So we decided to go for a week before we showered. We started on the lower horseshoe path and then went up the steps to the upper horseshoe path. Then we back across the Rifle Range and the cricket field.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I played with the RF module test sketch and the working module.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I had a trial Zoom webcast with Tom and Mike in preparation for our talk in June. Then it was back to the RF module. The other module does not seem to work!</p>
