        <h1>Tuesday 5th May</h1>
        <p>Another not very productive day. We did start with quite a long walk (again), going up the slope to the west of the Rifle Range. So the rest of the morning was spent clearing email and added notes on replacing the brake fluid to my Odds &amp; Ends page.</p>
        <p>Angela went into the garden, to potter, while I finished my presentation on 2.4 GHz radio control. I also started reading the 'Oldknow' email.</p>
