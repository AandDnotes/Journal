        <h1>Wednesday 6th May</h1>
        <p>We started with an even longer walk this morning, going around the Upper Horseshoe. Although it only took us an hour and a half. It was a sunny and quite hot day, with only a slight breeze.</p>
        <p>Angela continued pottering in the garden, while I caught up with email and, after lunch, washed the Panda. It took longer than I'd expected and will need a lot of work to clean it when we come to trade it in for a new model.</p>
