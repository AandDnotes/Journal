        <h1>Tuesday 19th May</h1>
        <p>A warm, bright day, so we started with a walk 'around the extended block'. After that Angela pottered in the garden and phoned people, while I modified my Adestra email (the date of the talk has needed to change).</p>
        <p>I also played with my RC breadboards. It seems that I may have 'fired' one of the Arduinos! I might need to buy another one, even though that model has been 'retired'.</p>
