        <h1>Thursday 21st May</h1>
        <p>Weekly groceries shopping day. I sat in the car while Angela queued. She wasn't that long, but I had time to phone Dad and read most of a 'free' magazine, although I had to sit in the passenger seat since it was too sunny in the driver's seat. We were home just after eleven.</p>
        <p>The forecast said it would not be as hot as yesterday, although it seemed hotter, so we didn't sit for long in the garden drinking coffee. Angela phoned people and I modified my Adestra email and re-submitted it.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela pottered in the garden and I cleared the gutters. Then I washed the gutters and facias along the front. I still have the back of the garage and the rest of the house to wash.</p>
        <p>Brian next door played his trumpet as usual at eight o'clock as we clapped at the front door.</p>
