        <h1>Saturday 16th May</h1>
        <p>Since we had no milk delivery this morning, in spite of Milkandmore saying that it would be delivered) we went directly to the High Street, firstly to get some rolls and then to go to the butchers and the Coop. I also went to the newsagents. We were home quite early since there were no queues at the times we went to each shop.</p>
        <p>The day was more cloudy and cooler than yesterday, so most of the rest of the day was spent indoors, at least for me. After reading some of the newspaper and while Angela pottered in the garden, I did the weekly accounts and investigated Dad's savings. I had inadvertently let one of his NS&I bonds be re-invested, when I should have cashed it. So in ten months time I will need to 'lend' Dad some money until the bond matures.</p>
        <p>We ate our main meal at lunchtime since we were due to speak with Victoria and there is rarely time afterwards to cook a meal. So we spoke with Victoria and Austin for about an hour and a half. Austin showed us his various birthday presents.</p>
        <p>We then took a short walk (around the block) before have tea. Earlier someone called to ask if we were interested in having our drive cleaned. They would steam clean the blocks, seal them and then brush in sand for Â£260. While we were talking with Victoria they did a small sample square and then did Marion and Brian's drive. They had gone by the time we got back from our walk, but a little later Elliot from opposite called to say that a friend of his had an industrial jet wash if we were interested, but Angela thinks it would look too 'sparkling'.</p>
