        <h1>Friday 12th June</h1>
        <p>This morning Angela needed to go to the butcher and to the Post Office and I needed to go to the pharmacy, so we went to the High Street in a somewhat round-about way. We went up the twitten, down the Bostal and Goring Road and then we separated, Angela to the Post Office and me to the Health Centre. I was able to just pick up my prescription, which is on an automatic renewal for several months. We then met at the butchers and returned home via the cricket field. We got home just before it started raining.</p>
        <p>I spent a while trying to redact the confidential comments on our Zoom talk feedback and then sent the feedback to the committee. I also asked Norman to send an invite to a potential new volunteer. I also moved my 'day in the life' web page to a better location (and changed the links to it) and sent the link to Roger as a potential article in Main Gear.</p>
        <p>I finally got around to removing a servo from the glider to use with my Arduino trials. I could see a good control signal on the oscilloscope, but the servo would not move!</p>
