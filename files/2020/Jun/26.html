        <h1>Friday 26th June</h1>
        <p>Not quite as warm, but breezier, with some rain over night and a short shower at dinner time. For me it was a lazy day. Angela walked to the High Street, but spent all day either sending email resulting from our PEI events discussions yesterday or trying to get our broadband speed problem resolved.</p>
        <p>After talking to TalkTalk support via online chat I was directed to call them on my mobile. But I had to take the front off the master socket and plug a micro filter, with phone and router, into the 'test' socket. However, I lost the 3G connection when I went downstairs. So I had to phone back on the land line (after I had plugged everything in). She said that she had modified some settings in the router, but didn't say what. I now need to monitor it for 48 hours.</p>
        <p>But by ten o'clock the download speed was less than 5Mb/s!</p>
