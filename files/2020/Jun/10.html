        <h1>Wednesday 10th June</h1>
        <p>I seem to be doing less and less each day. This morning we set off on a walk around the lower horseshoe just as a few spots of rain were falling. It didn't rain heavily, but did get worse as we progressed. Luckily there was plenty of tree cover. We were latish going out, so it was about 11:30 before we got home. We didn't go out again.</p>
        <p>After lunch (and Dutch) I resolved a problem with my 'day in the life' web page and then added some more to it. I also tidied the css.</p>
