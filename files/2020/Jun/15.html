        <h1>Monday 15th June</h1>
        <p>A fine, warm day. We started with a walk around the 'extended' block (via the snake path). Then, while Angela pottered in the garden, I contacted Sykes, the booking agent for the house in Anglesea. This could only be via an email, so I asked for options. I then played with an Arduino and servo. I connected a potentiometer and, after lunch, wrote a sketch so that I could move the servo by adjusting the pot. This worked with a servo taken from the glider, but not with the old servo. So I scrapped it.</p>
        <p>Angela pruned the bay bush on the front, so I helped cut the top. Before that I phoned Victoria Grand and had a chat with Dad.</p>
