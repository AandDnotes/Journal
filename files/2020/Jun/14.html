        <h1>Sunday 14th June</h1>
        <p>It was overcast and so not particularly enticing for a walk, so I did the weekly account, including reconciling my spreadsheet against the statement. I then renewed our Virgin Money ISAs, at a rather paltry interest rate, and for three years.</p>
        <p>Angela spent a lot of the day pottering in the garden. Whereas I spent a lot of the remaining morning clearing the weeds from the drive (the lower portion). After lunch I brushed sand into the gaps.</p>
        <p>After stopping for tea we spoke very briefly to Paul and Rowan. They were just about to have dinner, but had been out this morning to Lotta's birthday party. They also said that Greet is getting a puppy!</p>
