        <h1>Saturday 13th June</h1>
        <p>To our surprise the morning dawned warm and with a clear blue sky. So our walk to the High Street to get rolls and a paper was via the 'snake path'. Then it was time to do some more weed removal from the drive. After a couple of other session I only have seven rows at the the bottom of the drive left to clean. In between I cut the grass.</p>
        <p>We spent the usual 90 minutes (approximately) talking with Victoria. Brandon thinks that his company are doing it all wrong and not listening to him, again.</p>
