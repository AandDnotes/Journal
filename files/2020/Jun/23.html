        <h1>Tuesday 23rd June</h1>
        <p>High up on the far side of Steyning Horseshoe there is a mountain biking area. Enthusiasts have built ramps and jumps in addition to the 45 degree slopes! This morning we walked along one of the paths through that area. We gone out fairly early (for us), leaving at 9:15, but it took us an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>When we got back I put another coat of black paint on the house number. Later in the afternoon I put some white Hammerite on the raised number and outside border.</p>
        <p>Angela pottered in the front garden and I completed my write-up of the work I did on the MG's carburettors.</p>
        <p>After dinner we had our IET Sussex committee meeting via Zoom. It was a little problematic since I had expected that people could join using the link I had sent, But I had to send them a more complete link. Then the meeting finished after 40 minutes and we had to join it again; and again. Next time we will use Gregg's account, but I must inform people who are joining a meeting on Thursday.</p>
