        <h1>Tuesday 16th June</h1>
        <p>We started with a walk deciding to go across to the Rifle Range. When we got there we investigated the gate at the far (western) end, hoping that it would lead to a path. In fact it only led to the old target contraptions and the remains of some buildings. There were eight raise/lower mechanisms behind a brick wall and bank. From above this you could see two ridges that were firing lines. Apparently the range was used until the 80s. We then went back into the field and climbed up a steep path to the path that comes down from the Upper Horseshoe path.</p>
        <p>At one o'clock I joined an IET webinar on e-m waves. It didn't really teach me a lot, but did show the work that enabled Maxwell to define his equations. I ate lunch during the webinar and afterwards sent an email to the local PEI people about a Zoom meeting to discuss how we can share details of events.</p>
        <p>Earlier the broadband download speed was terrible, so before and after the webinar I spent a lot of time online chatting with someone from TalkTalk. They tried doing various test on the line and wanted to test the router, but wanted to be able to chat over another route. But the phone would not connect to their web site, so they wanted me to arrange to use a neighbour's broadband! In the end they suggested doing a hard reset and monitoring it. After the reset I couldn't open any web page, until I'd done another reboot.</p>
        <p>Finally I uploaded this morning's photos and added an entry to my 'lockdown walks' page.</p>
