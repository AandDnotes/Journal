        <h1>Thursday 4th June</h1>
        <p>Another grey day and we set off fairly early to the supermarket. There was no queue and so Angela was quite quick. In fact we were home by about 10:30. However, Angela had not been able to buy some 'baking paper' for Anita, so at 11:20 we walked to Hyde Square (via the river) to buy some. It was nearly one by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was then spent writing email associated with last night's talk and doing various 'sitting down' jobs.</p>
