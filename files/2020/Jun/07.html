        <h1>Sunday 7th June</h1>
        <p>Not a particularly productive day. The weather was variable, some sun, mostly cloud and a little rain. Angela compiled a list of WI member's email addresses and went out to post a card and call on the WI secretary (with the list). I wrote an email to Irvine Wilson and registered with the MG-TABC Forum, adding an entry in their 'member's cars' section.</p>
        <p>At various times during the day I added some paint to the 'insect hotel' until it was complete. So I photographed it and posted it for the others to see.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday we spoke to Paul and just a little to Rowan, who was watching part of The Witches film. Our birthday present to her had arrived. It was disappointing to find that there was no speed control, just stop/go forward/reverse. There was also only left/right/straight ahead.</p>
