        <h1>Tuesday 2nd June</h1>
        <p>I was expecting a more gentle walk today, after yesterday's exertion. We didn't go up much, but we walked a long way, going west, beyond the Rifle Range and looping back south under the rise of the hills. After an hour and a half we got back to the High Street, bought takeaway coffees in Victoria's Sponge and sat under a tree in the park to drink them. </p>
        <p>So it was lunch-time before we got back. After lunch I cut the front grass (really just removing the spikes), cutting the two other lawns later, when the battery had recharged. In between I paid Dad's newspaper bill, renewed our car insurance and then our house insurance. Attempts to do both online failed and I had to phone them.</p>
