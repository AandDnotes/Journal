        <h1>Thursday 18th June</h1>
        <p>A slightly more productive day. It had been raining overnight and was still spitting while we had breakfast. It had stopped by the time we went off to do the weekly supermarket shop, although it was drizzling when we got to the other side of the Downs. Luckily there was no queue.</p>
        <p>As usual I phoned Dad while I waited in the car and then read until Angela had finished. We were home in time for coffee. Then, before lunch, I went over the drive with the wire brush, removing the weeds that had started growing.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put the servos back in the glider. I had to charge the transmitter's batteries to test that the servos worked. I also dismantled the test set up, but kept the two breadboards complete for future experimentation.</p>
