        <h1>Thursday 11th June</h1>
        <p>Another day doing very little. We set off earlier than usual to the supermarket. Again no queue. I phoned Dad while waiting in the car and we were home by 10:30. Just after eleven we called Kate on Facetime, since it was her birthday.</p>
        <p>After lunch I emailed the group of PEI chairpersons about a meeting and a person who wants to volunteer for the Sussex Network. I also uploaded my 'day in the life' web page to github.</p>
