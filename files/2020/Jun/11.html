        <h1>Thursday 11th June</h1>
        <p>Another day doing very little. We set off earlier than usual to the supermarket. Again no queue. I phoned Dad while waiting in the car and we were home by 10:30. Just after eleven we called Kate on Facetime, since it was her birthday.</p>
        <p>However, two fairly momentus events happened today. Firstly, Victoria emailed to say that Norwegian had cancelled their flight in August, so they should get a refund and they definitely will not be coming over. Norwegian had already announced that they would not be flying from/to Gatwick for the foreseeable future. Secondly, we had a call from Kevin at Freestyle Kitchens. They are opeining again on Monday and are starting to finish projects. Their hold-up at the moment is that they can't get plaster. Also, our kitchen was delivered, minus an oven housing. However, they have two other kitchens to finish fitting first and expect ours to start in the second week of July.</p>
        <p>After lunch I emailed the group of PEI chairpersons about a meeting and a person who wants to volunteer for the Sussex Network. I also uploaded my 'day in the life' web page to github.</p>
