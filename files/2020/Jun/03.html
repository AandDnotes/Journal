        <h1>Wednesday 3rd June</h1>
        <p>Today was the first grey day for quite a long time. It was odd not see blue sky. Although Angela went for a short walk after lunch, I had a day off. I did the monthly accounts, which, after a late start, took most of the morning.</p>
        <p>I discovered that the oscilloscope seemed to work when I powered it from the alternative power input. Although I had power at the input to the diode, but nothing beyond it, it seems that I was using the wrong power input plug. I can only assume that the contact was so slight that the small resistance of the diode was too much for it. Anyway, I now have a working oscilloscope, but the signal from the Arduino was not what it should be. I will need to try a servo from the glider.</p>
        <p>We held our first Zoom webinar. We had 129 people at the peak and overall it lasted for about 90 minutes.</p>
