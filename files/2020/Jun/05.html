        <h1>Friday 5th June</h1>
        <p>Angela was out first. She went to the butchers and delivered things to Anita. Meanwhile I wrote some follow-up emails to our talk on Wednesday. I also 'played' with an Arduino, a servo and the oscilloscope. At least without one of the old servos I could see the pulse changing width.</p>
        <p>After lunch we had a call from the Steyning Shop & Post Office to say that my 'patio brush' was in. So I walked down to the High Street to collect it. Later, I put most of the 'bug hotel' together.</p>
        <p>After dinner Angela made me a face mask since she didn't like my idea of a bandana.</p>
