        <h1>Tuesday 30th June</h1>
        <p>It rained from the start and didn't stop until dinner time. So we didn't go out.</p>
        <p>Angela spent some time working on a cross-stitch of Steyning and I emailed Julie Hudson about our wishes to live broadcast all our talks. Her response was not encouraging. I also emailed 'Taff the Horn' about new parts for the TC's horn. He replied quickly, so I will order some bits tomorrow.</p>
        <p>I also made a short video of the horn working, just in case I can't get it to do so after I have put it back together properly. I also added a page to my notebook about Angela's cross-stitch.</p>
