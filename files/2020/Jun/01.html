        <h1>Monday 1st June</h1>
        <p>My 72nd birthday and another clear blue sky. We started by walking around the Upper Horseshoe, which took nearly one and a half hours. When we got home the postman had delivered cards from Austin and Juniper and from Alan and Chris. Also, Paul et al FaceTimed, Alan phoned, and later Victoria FaceTimed. I also had messages from Brighton University, Ian Talmadge and George Turnbull. Later I emailed Ian.</p>
        <p>After lunch and the receipt of an email from Simon Chandler, I realised that I'd forgotten to forward details of our Zoom talk to the IMechE, ICE and RCEA. So I quickly did that. I also suggested that we get together to see how we can we can share details of events.</p>
        <p>I investigated the lack of power in the oscilloscope, but can find nothing other than a faulty diode, which seems unlikely.</p>
