        <h1>Thursday 25th June</h1>
        <p>Although we started with the usual weekly trip to the supermarket, we were earlier than usual, getting home just after 10:30. It was a very hot day, so we parked a little further away from the store than usual, in the shade of a tree. There was a short queue, which Angela joined, and I went to the cash machine to get some money and 'initialise' my new debit card. I then phoned Dad. While talking to him he suddenly complained of pains in his chest. I told him to hang up and press his button. After a few minutes I phoned Julie to tell her and then, after we got home, called her again. It seems that he didn't mention the chest pain, just saying that he came over giddy. But she said that he was now fine.</p>
        <p>When we got home we found a letter from Everest saying that they had gone into administration! So it doesn't look as though we will get a replacement pane for the sitting room window. I then addressed some of the actions from Tuesday's IET committee meeting. I also added another page to my 'notebook'.</p>
        <p>After dinner I held a Zoom meeting for people from various PEIs to talk about how we can hold more joint events and publicise each other's events.</p>
