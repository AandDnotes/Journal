        <h1>Monday 29th June</h1>
        <p>Nearly the end of June and we had to put a sweater on today. It was also pretty breezy. Angela had a virtual coffee morning via Zoom at 10:30 so we didn't go for a walk. I phoned Dad and then paid his paper bill before reviewing the Brighton GoG papers and replying to Melissa.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went in the garage to try to work out how to assemble the horn and adjust it so as to see if it will work. My model isn't quite the same as the one described in the manual I have. However, I cleaned the points and then found a cable from a portable TV (that I think we bought wen in Derby) with crocodile clips on one end for connection to a 12 volt battery. I removed the plug from the other end and fixed the positive cable into one terminal on the horn, before connecting the cable to the MG's battery. I had guessed the air gap between the coil and the armature, but nothing happened when I touched the negative cable to the other terminal. I unwound the push-rod a little, touched the terminal with the cable again and it made a sound! I will now take it apart and clean it up.</p>
        <p>Angela had bought a pineapple on Thursday, so we had some for desert. It cut easily and tasted good.</p>
