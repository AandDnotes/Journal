        <h1>Sunday 28th June</h1>
        <p>Although it was raining when we got up, it had stopped in time for us to go for a walk after breakfast, although it was quite breezy. We went up the 'snake' path, but then, as we were coming down the upper horseshoe path we took another path that brought us down on to the lower horseshoe path. We were only out for about 45 minutes. Later I made a notebook entry about our walks.</p>
        <p>Angela did some pottering in the garden and I removed the horn from the MG with the intent of taking it apart. I discovered that the tone plate and domed retaining nut are missing! Later I confirmed from photos that they had been there until at least September 2016. Once again I could not remove the diaphragm lock nut, so left it for a while with some WD40. It still would not move, so tried some heat. Still no luck. Both might actually have helped, since a hefty blows with a plastic ended hammer on the socket handle finally freed it. The coil has a very slightly higher resistance than specified and initially the contact breaker points would not pass a current. However, after a little cleaning they were starting to work.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday afternoon we spoke with Paul. They had been to Greet and Wim's to see their new puppy. As often happens, Rowan was busy and did not want us to know what she was doing.</p>
