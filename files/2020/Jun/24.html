        <h1>Wednesday 24th June</h1>
        <p>A day that was too hot to do very much. Angela went walking with her WI friends, although I think they spent a lot of time in someone's garden drinking coffee. Meanwhile, I put a second coat of white paint on the house number. Later in the afternoon I put it back on the wall.</p>
        <p>I also spent some time sending email resulting from yesterday's IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>Although I still have several email to write, I got distracted by creating a new web site in the hope that the grandchildren might find it interesting.</p>
