        <h1>Saturday 27th June</h1>
        <p>I had rained overnight and was still raining when we got up. However, it had stopped raining by the time we were ready to go out. We went to the High Street via the lower horseshoe, meeting Terry and Misha in the cricket field. Unfortunately by then it had started raining and it was pretty breezy.</p>
        <p>We bought a newspaper and some rolls, but were quite wet by the time we got home. After reading some of the paper I did the weekly accounts, which didn't take long. Angela had tried looking at her email, but they would not load. When I checked the broadband speed it was only a few Mb/s. So I tried phoning TalkTalk, but they said they had fewer people on the help desk and 20 minute waits. So I rebooted the router!</p>
        <p>I completed a diagram of the way in which the MG's horn works and wrote an entry in my notebook for the grandchildren. I didn't get into the garage to actually start work on the horn.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke to Victoria. Austin and Juniper were playing a Lego Dinosaur game.</p>
