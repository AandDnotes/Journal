        <h1>Monday 8th June</h1>
        <p>Another slow start to the day. I started with a call to Dad, who seems to be well. There were lots of people in his room cleaning and making his bed. It's difficult to know where the rest of the morning went. I had a reply from Irvine, which was nice. I also started drafting an email to the local PEIs about sharing our event details.</p>
        <p>After lunch I tried out the new 'patio' brush. It seemed to work quite well and I cleared weeds and moss from the top part of the drive and brushed in some sand. After dinner I finished drafting my 'PEI' email.</p>
