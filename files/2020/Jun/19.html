        <h1>Friday 19th June</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up this morning, and had been for a while. I spent the morning preparing for next week's committee meeting, which included emailing Helen at STEM SE Hub about the Egg Race.</p>
        <p>The day improved and so after lunch we went for a walk. Just our usual extended block walk. However, there was a lot of traffic on the Bostal Road. Then I made some additions to my 'family' web pages.</p>
