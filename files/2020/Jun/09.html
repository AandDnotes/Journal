        <h1>Tuesday 9th June</h1>
        <p>We started with a walk around the upper horseshoe, starting by going across the cricket field and the up the edge of the Rifle Range. We returned along the 'snake' path and the twitten. After coffee in the garden I cut up an old bamboo cane for the insect hotel and hung it from the wall of the garage. Angela 'trimmed' the two shrubs that grow up the walls in the garden and then shredded the clippings.</p>
        <p>After lunch I cleared some more weeds from the block paving while Angela trimmed grass edges and then cooked dinner and some oat biscuits.</p>
