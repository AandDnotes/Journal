        <h1>Saturday 20th June</h1>
        <p>The Summer Equinox; the longest day of the year. I don't know why it tends to move around a bit (I always think it should be the 21st), but days get shorter from here on. The skies looked quite threatening first thing this morning, but it was warm and the sun peeked out from amongst the clouds on numerous occasions throughout the day. In fact, a shirt and sweater was too warm for our walk. And I'd taken a cagoule just in case!</p>
        <p>We went off, fairly early (9:30 ish) to the High Street, via the lower horseshoe, to buy meat, rolls and paper. There was a sizeable queue outside the butchers and then Angela met a friend from church, so we were quite late home.</p>
        <p>I had tried to phone Sykes, the booking agent for the Welsh house, before we left, but their lines did not open until ten o'clock. So I called them just before midday. Their recorded message did warn that they were busy, with waiting time of up to an hour. It was just over an hour before someone answered. He said that the Welsh government had, yesterday, said that overnight stays in Wales would be allowed from July 13th. Since our rental was from August 1st we could not cancel our booking without loosing our deposit (nearly Â£500), but we could move the booking. The first two weeks of August 2021 were already booked, so we settled for August 14th 2021. He reserved that week, but needs to check with the house owner. I think we will need to pay some more because the rates have gone up for next year. He will email confirmation when they get a response from the owner.</p>
        <p>After lunch I updated one of our family history web pages, adding photos and some text to the Ludlam/Wilkinson page. We then spoke with Victoria. The revised date in 2021 should be fine for them.</p>
