        <h1>Monday 22nd June</h1>
        <p>A warm and sunny day. As often happens, we had a fairly late start. After a shower we went out for a walk, leaving just after ten o'clock. We went over the iron bridge and along the river to Beeding Bridge, then through Bramber. We were disappointed that the Castle Hotel is closed on Mondays, so we couldn't stop for a (take-away) coffee.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned Dad. It seems that they all had tea and cake in the garden. I'm not sure when this was, but he enjoyed it. I then removed the house number from the garage wall, cleaned it (which took quite a lot of effort) and put a coat of black Hammerite on the back and the recessed background of the front. I then 'brushed' fast growing weeds off the drive before they get too large.</p>
