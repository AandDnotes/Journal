        <h1>Saturday 6th June</h1>
        <p>We took what has become our usual 'long route' to the High Street, via the twitten and Newham Lane. Angela had been to the butchers yesterday, so we only bought some bread rolls and a newspaper. Needless to say, most of the rest of the morning was spent reading the paper. The rest was spent finishing gluing together parts of the 'insect hotel'. After lunch I started painting it.</p>
        <p>Also as usual we spoke with Victoria, for at least an hour and a half. Then a little more painting.</p>
