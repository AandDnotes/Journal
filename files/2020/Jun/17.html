        <h1>Wednesday 17th June</h1>
        <p>I had a lazy day. Angela went off walking with her WI friends, leaving before I'd come out of the bathroom. I 'played' with my RF equipment, getting one of the servos from the glider working with the Arduinos and RF modules. Then I removed the second servo and managed to get that working also, provided I started them in a particular order, without the serial interface.</p>
        <p>After lunch (quite late after lunch) I found that the system would not start, but it did start using the serial interface on the 'plane'. At times the Ardunio continually rebooting. So I concluded that there were so many plug in connections (8+) that the resistance was too high. Meanwhile, Angela pottered in the garden.</p>
        <p>I opened the holes in my plane mock-up to take the larger servos and made a short video of the system working. I then added the video (and the video of the trace on the oscilloscope) to my presentation.</p>
