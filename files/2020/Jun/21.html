        <h1>Sunday 21st June</h1>
        <p>A more productive day today. It was raining when we got up, so we didn't go for a walk, although it soon dried up and was sunny, if breezy. I started by solving (I hope) the E&amp;T prize puzzle in the July issue.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I started adjusting the fuel level in the carburettor float chambers. I removed the pistons and started the fuel pump. I could see the fuel was up to the top of the jet on the front carburettor, but couldn't be seen in the rear one. So I removed the top of the front float chamber, found a long 7/16" bolt, straightened the lever and adjusted it to give the required distance.</p>
        <p>After lunch I replaced the float chamber top and repeated the exercise on the rear carburettor. I also checked the spark plugs before we had a chat with Paul and Rowan. Krista's parents were there since they are going off for a week's holiday tomorrow.</p>
