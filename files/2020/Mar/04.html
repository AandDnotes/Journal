        <h1>Wednesday 4th March</h1>
        <p>Angela's neck has been stiff for several days. It seems to have improved, but is still a problem. I spent time in the garage and eventually managed to remove the front, near-side brake cylinder.</p>
        <p>Everest called to ask if they could bring forward the installation of our windows. The scaffolding will go up on Friday and they will start installation on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>We eat early and went to the Steyning Centre to see the monthly film, this time it was Downton Abbey. It was an entertaining 'feel-good' film, where everyone was happy in the end.</p>
