        <h1>Saturday 14th March</h1>
        <p>A wasted morning, a better afternoon and a good evening.</p>
        <p>We went into Worthing to an appointment with Barclays about closing our Santander 1-2-3 accounts and moving the direct debits and standing orders over to our current account. However, they needed our Santander debit cards, which Angela had, but I did not! So we made another appointment for Monday morning.</p>
        <p>We had parked in Morrisons (someone just beat us to a space near the Assembly Halls) and Angela wanted to buy one or two thins. So we went in there on our way back, only to find hugh queues at all the checkouts, even the self-checkouts. Evidence of panic buying? So we didn't bother.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela sorted out her lunch club book-keeping with Linda and I started fixeing the satalite cable to the dining room back on the wall. However, I couldn't pin it above the new kitchen window, so will need to try using silicone sealant.</p>
        <p>We then dressed up (dinner jacket and bow tie) and walked to the Tollgate for the WSMGOC Annual Dinner. We wore walking shoes and changed when we got there. A number of people had decided not to attend. There were, I think, 28 people. It was a good evening, even if we did have to walk home.</p>
