        <h1>Thursday 5th March</h1>
        <p>It rained all day, sometimes heavily. We couldn't follow our usual schedule for a Thursday, since Angela had a WI committee meeting this morning and the kitchen fitter was due to call in the afternoon. So I went off to visit Dad at Victoria Grand, returning the sample flooring panel to the shop in Findon Valley on the way and arranging dates for the work.</p>
        <p>The fitter, called James, will be able to lift the floor tiles, but otherwise only took a few measurements. It was still raining after he left and so Angela decided to leave the weekly groceries shop until tomorrow. While Angela went to tell Lynn next door that scaffolders would be coming tomorrow, I removed the wall-tiles on the kitchen windowsill. Luckily they came off fairly easily.</p>
        <p>During their conversation, Lynn commented that under her bamboo floor (which she replaced with carpet) she found a wood-block floor, which she said was throughout the ground floor. We had expected the floor to be concrete, so I lifted a corner of the carpet in the dining room and found wood-block! So I need to call the flooring shop int he morning to see if this is a problem.</p>
