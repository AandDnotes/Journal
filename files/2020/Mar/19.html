        <h1>Thursday 19th March</h1>
        <p>The news is still mainly about the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>We were up early since the scaffolders were here at ten to eight. Actually they didn't start until eight, so as not to make noise too early. They were done by ten. Angela had planned to go shopping since Sainsbury's were reserving 7-8 for over seventy-year-olds. However, we heard on Radio Sussex that there we traffic jams at all local Sainsbury's stores. So she stayed home.</p>
        <p>This morning I phoned Victoria Grand to speak with Dad and we moved the sideboard into the sitting room and thought where we might put the rest.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to one of her WI friends to get a cheque signed while I went into the garage. However, I failed to get the brake hose off the slave cylinder, even after using heat and more WD40. So I did a little more of the porting of my RC web site.</p>
