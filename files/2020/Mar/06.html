        <h1>Friday 6th March</h1>
        <p>An early start. We were up by 6:30 in case the scaffolders arrived at seven. In fact they arrived at 7:30. They took their time, they said, because they didn't have much on today. They left around lunch time. We were a little concerned that they had put boards on Lynn's garage roof as a base for some poles. However, Lynn said that they had asked her first. Luckily it was a mainly sunny and dry day.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to a meeting in Beeding and I went into the garage. I managed to remove the bleed nipple from the front, near-side brake cylinder and then cleaned it. I also ordered new metal cups that fit within the rummer seals in the cylinder, so I can't put it back together until they arrive.</p>
        <p>Then after dinner I went to the flying club AGM. The discussion was mainly about safety and any need to do a risk assessment to show that the rules mitigated all the risks. I spoke to Keith about any interest from members on a talk on the RF communication used by our transmitters and receivers. I was home at 9:45.</p>
