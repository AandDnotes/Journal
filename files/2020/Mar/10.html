        <h1>Tuesday 10th March</h1>
        <p>The window fitters arrived at 8:30. They had travelled from Sittingbourne! By the end of the day they had fitted the new windows upstairs (apart from the landing) and the two windows in the dining room.</p>
        <p>In the morning Angela took her lunch club cash to the bank in Storrington on the bus. Meanwhile, I researched GDPR and drafted some notes for the WSMGOC.</p>
        <p>After lunch it was my time to go out. I went to Field Place to an RCEA talk on military aircraft simulators. I was home just after five, by which time the fitters had left. Angela had already hung the bedroom curtains, so we put back those in the dining room and took down those on one of the sitting room windows.</p>
