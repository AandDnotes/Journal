        <h1>Friday 27th March</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the butchers I installed the washing machine and then it was put to use. It was another sunny day with a chilly wind, but was fine in the garage. I spent the afternoon refitting the off-side front brake cylinder. It took a while to get the copper pipe into the flexible hose. In the process the pipe kinked, but hopefully is not cracked. Getting the brake shoes refitted also took a while.</p>
        <p>Angela did her drawing of a town on the back of an animal! I posted a drawing of 'bananas on pyjamas'. I also started writing an article for Main Gear.</p>
