        <h1>Monday 30th March</h1>
        <p>A brighter, slightly warmer and less windy day. After a slow start Angela went into the garden and I went into the garage. She planted seeds and I put the brake drum back on the off-side front wheel. Then I bled the near-side slave cylinder. It took a while, but I couldn't get the air out, so I moved over to the off-side. That seemed to take less effort and I then went back to the near-side, which seemed to work this time.</p>
        <p>However, although the brake pedal seemed quite firm I discovered that fluid was leaking from the off-side cylinder. It must have been leaking while bleeding the near-side, since there was a pool of fluid under the plastic mat that I had on the floor. It took a while to clear it up. The leak must have been coming from the bleed nipple, since the I had not been able to remove the hose from the cylinder, so that joint should not be leaking. I may need to remove that cylinder and clean out the bleed nipple hole. I will also need to 'stamp' on the brake pedal and then remove all the brake drums to check that the cylinders are not leaking.</p>
