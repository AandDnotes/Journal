        <h1>Tuesday 24th March</h1>
        <p>One of my tasks today was to transfer enough money from Dad's Santander savings account into his Barclays current account so that his rent can be paid. However, the Santander online system would not let me log in since both our 1-2-3 accounts were closed today! I noticed that the balance from both accounts had been transferred into our Barclays account.</p>
        <p>I tried phoning them, but either was cut off or put on hold. Then I found log-in details for Dad's account! This worked (it sent a one-time-password to my mobile) and I was able to request the transfer. However, this all took a big chunk out of the day.</p>
        <p>While Angela worked in the garden, spreading compost from the bin around the garden, I started making some shelves for the shed. I cut two of the three shelves from parts of the shelves from the kitchen cupboard, to fit the 'ladder' ends that I made in Lymm. One more shelf to cut. It was a warm, sunny day, although chilly in the garage.</p>
