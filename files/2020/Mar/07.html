        <h1>Saturday 7th March</h1>
        <p>A busy morning and a lazy afternoon. We started as usual with a walk into the village to buy a newspaper. I then removed old TV arial cables coming into the sitting room and our bedroom. To do this I climbed up on to the scaffold at the back.</p>
        <p>We then took Reenie and Joy down to the Methodist Church to the St Barnabus Cottage Pie lunch. We were home by 2:30 and then spoke with Victoria just after four.</p>
