        <h1>Tuesday 31st March</h1>
        <p>Since all my garage working clothes (overalls, trousers and fleece) as well as some long pants went in the wash because I had knelt in some brake fluid, I decided not to go in the garage today. So this morning was all about finances and this afternoon was partly taken up with a walk.</p>
        <p>I moved some money from our current account to an existing Virgin savings account and opened a similar account for Angela. Tomorrow we will move some money from her RBS account so as to reduce the amount in it. Since it was the last day of the month I started doing the monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>It was a pleasant day, with quite a lot of sunshine and a light wind. After lunch we walked along Lanes Road and up Newham Lane, then down Bostal Road to the twitten next to our house. It could have been longer, but we were back in time for a cup of tea. Afterwards I started looking at touching up the paint around the bathroom window. I sanded it and put a little filler in some places, which meant leaving it for 24 hours before painting.</p>
