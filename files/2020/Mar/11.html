        <h1>Wednesday 11th March</h1>
        <p>We expected the window fitters to arrive at about 9:30, so we were not up early. The scaffold tower arrived at about eight o'clock and the first fitter arrived at 8:30! Their meeting had been postponed until tomorrow. During the day they fitted the two windows in the sitting room, the kitchen and the landing windows.</p>
        <p>At breakfast I realised that I had not paid for my meal on Monday evening, so I phoned the pub and called in there on my way to the Sussex Wanderers lunch at Adversane. It was a good lunch, but I left early so that Angela could get to table tennis for a while.</p>
