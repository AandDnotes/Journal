        <h1>Friday 13th March</h1>
        <p>A more successful day than yesterday, in spite of the date. Angela phoned Santander and they un-blocked her account and approved the transfer. Later we applied for an ISA for her, checked that the money was in our current account and transferred it into our Shawbrook accounts. We also made an appointment for tomorrow at Barclays in Worthing to try to arrange for all our direct debits and standing orders to be moved and the 1-2-3 accounts closed.</p>
        <p>The window fitters arrived a little later than expected, but they had finished fitting the new front door, the cloakroom window and the paneling below it by early afternoon. So then it was time to pay the balance! Meanwhile, I refitted the net curtain in our bedroom, without putting the screws into the window frame, as was done previously. Later I refitted the vertical blind in the study. The brackets were designed to be screwed into the window frame, so I drilled new holes in them, used small pieces of trim (left for use on the kitchen window) as packing and screwed them into the wooden lintel above the frame.</p>
