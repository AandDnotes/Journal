        <h1>Sunday 15th March</h1>
        <p>In addition to the usual updates and backups I spent a lot of time 'chatting' to TalkTalk about our broadband download speed that was only a quarter of what it should be. However, their measure was 34Mbps (whereas mine was less than ten) and they couldn't find a fault. I turned off the router just before lunch, leaving it off for half an hour. The speed was then fine. Meanwhile, Angela went to church.</p>
        <p>After lunch I fixed the remaining piece of TV cable in place and then had a trial MS Teams video call with Greg. We then tried using FaceTime, which was much better.</p>
        <p>Then we spoke with Paul et al.</p>
