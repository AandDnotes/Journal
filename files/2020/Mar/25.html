        <h1>Wednesday 25th March</h1>
        <p>We had to start fairly early this morning since I had arranged to take the Panda into Simms for them to investigate the noise we heard when turning sharply. So I took the car down for 8:30 and walked back through the cricket field and twittens. They phoned later to say that they couldn't find any problem. So after lunch I walked back down and paid them Â£30 cash (no VAT) for their time.</p>
        <p>In between I finished the shelves for the shed and cut a piece of board to put under the washing machine when we move it back into the sitting room for the kitchen to be refitted. Meanwhile Angela cleared out the shed. It was another sunny, but chilly day.</p>
