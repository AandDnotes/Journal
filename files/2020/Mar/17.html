        <h1>Tuesday 17th March</h1>
        <p>My intent had been to work on the TC today. It was a bright, dry and reasonably warm day, but apart from a quick spin around the block in the Panda, I spent a lot of the day in front of a computer. Angela took her WI cash to the bank in Storrington (by bus) while I sent a few email. The IET advised that all events should be cancelled a least to the end of June. So we basically cancelled the remains of our 2019/20 programme. I then emailed my remaining speaker. I also had a trial video call with Dave Posner (who was working from home in France) using Zoom. We will try using it for our events sub-committee meeting.</p>
        <p>My reason for taking the Panda around the block was because I heard a 'graunching' noise when we last pulled on to the drive. I suspect the wheel bearings, but I didn't hear anything on my little run.</p>
        <p>After lunch I helped Angela tackle an HSBC online form for the lunch club. Not a user friendly form. After that I didn't have the energy to go in the garage. So I did a little more to porting my RC web site to GitHub.</p>
