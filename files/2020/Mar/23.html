        <h1>Monday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>We were up early in preparation for the arrival of the kitchen fitter, but we had a call from Kevin just after eight o'clock, basically suggesting that we put the kitchen refit on hold. He will call in a couple of days when they have worked out what they will be doing. I then called the flooring shop and put that on hold also. We had been concerned that it only needed the fitter, the electrician, the plasterer or the floorer (or us) to fall ill and we would be stuck with no kitchen for an indeterminate length of time. After Kevin's call we felt quite relieved.</p>
        <p>So we put the fridge back and gradually moved things back as we needed to use them. I will move the washing machine and plumb it back in before we need to use it. We now probably need to put up with the dripping tap for several more months!</p>
        <p>It was another sunny day, albeit with a chilly wind, so Angela worked in the garden and before lunch I cut the grass in the back garden and the walled garden. After lunch I cut the grass in the front garden, swept the paths and cleared some weeds from the drive.</p>
        <p>Finally, we had our first dinner that did not require the kitchen, even though we still had one.</p>
