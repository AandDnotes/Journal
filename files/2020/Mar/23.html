        <h1>Monday 23rd March</h1>
        <p>We had a call from Kevin just after eight o'clock, basically suggesting that we put the kitchen refit on hold. He will call in a couple of days when they have worked out what they will be doing. I then called the flooring shop and put that on hold also.</p>
