        <h1>Monday 2nd March</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day and a dry one, with a bit of sunshine. On our way to Victoria Grand we called into the flooring shop and borrowed a larger sample of the style of floor that we are thinking of for the hall, dining room and kitchen. We also gave them the target days for screeding the floor.</p>
        <p>On the way back we went to Roger's Farm to have coffee and buy some cuttings compost.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went in the garden and I downloaded the list of registrants for tomorrow's talk (all 112 of them) and produced an attendance list. Later, my speaker sent his biography.</p>
        <p>The brake cylinder seals arrived in the post, so later I reassembled the rear off-side slave cylinder and fitted it to the back plate after cleaning it. The new seals were fine, but, as before, the boots seemed too small. However, with a little brake fluid as lubricant, I was able to 'prise' the boot over the piston and over the cylinder.</p>
