        <h1>Friday 20th March</h1>
        <p>Today was the Spring Equinox, although you would never have known it. It was a grey, windy and chilly day. We started by going to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm. There were no queues and not too many people in the store. However, some shelves were pretty empty. No flour or yeast, no tissues and, for some reason, no tonic water! On our way our I bought some silicone spray lubricant in Halfords and we picked up some paint brochures in B&amp;Q.</p>
        <p>While Angela went down to the butchers (which was closed) and the Post Office (to post Paul's birthday cards) I lubricated the front door hinges and letter box and started putting more kitchen stuff in boxes. We then moved the dining room table into the sitting room, later eating dinner on it.</p>
