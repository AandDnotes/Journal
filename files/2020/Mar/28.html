        <h1>Saturday 28th March</h1>
        <p>We had a bit of a day off today. It started sunny, but with a keen wind, but clouded over later in the day. We started with our usual Saturday walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also bought some bread rolls and some carrots and onion (which turned into a few other items as well). We took a slightly longer route home so that we had our daily exercise.</p>
        <p>After that I did the weekly accounts, including adding in the details of the closure of our 1-2-3 accounts. We then spent a lot of the day reading the paper. However, we did speak with Victoria et al. They have all been at home this week, although Brandon needs to go into work next week to help harvest an experiment.</p>
