        <h1>Wednesday 18th March</h1>
        <p>I finally managed to get a couple of hours in the garage, although not until four o'clock. I replaced the near-side front brake drum and cleaned the off-side brake shoes, springs and pistons from the slave cylinder. Then I loosened the cylinder from the back plate, but couldn't undo the brake pipe, so I put on some WD40 and left it.</p>
        <p>Earlier I emailed IET members who had not been active on the committee and did a little more of the porting of my RC web site. The broadband speed was low again (as measured by 'speed-of-me') although the TalkTalk tool said it was fine. So I rebooted the router and it was fine again.</p>
        <p>We have interpreted the advice to stay indoors as to avoid unnecessary contact. So Angela went out to deliver some newsletters.</p>
