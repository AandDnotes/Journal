        <h1>Sunday 8th March</h1>
        <p>A day of various activities. Angela went to church as usual and I did the file backups and then went into the garage. I finished cleaning the front near-side back plate. I can't put it back together until the new spring cups arrive. I also started stripping down the front off-side. It looks as though the brake cylinder has been leaking. After lunch I brought the heavy ladder in, with the aim of taking down the vertical blind on the stairwell. I managed to get the ladder in place, although it was a struggle, and could have taken the blind down, but, when pulled back it is clear of the window. So I just tied up the two groups of blinds. I also tied up both sides of the sitting room blind before we take it down.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Paul et al. Today was Kista's birthday.</p>
