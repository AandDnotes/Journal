        <h1>Monday 9th March</h1>
        <p>A bright, sunny and quite warm day (until about four o'clock) and we started by visiting Dad in Victoria Grand. We went on to Sainsbury's for coffee and to buy some rolls for lunch. We were back in time for Angela to then go down to the church to help with the lunch club. She got home about three o'clock, without the need for me to drive anyone home.</p>
        <p>The springs (that replace the brake cylinder spring and crown washers) arrived this morning, so later I re-assembled the near-side front cylinder and fixed it back on the car. I also re-fitted the shoes. Before I did that we were able to take down the vertical blinds on the patio doors, in preparation for tomorrow's start for replacement of the windows.</p>
        <p>I came in from the garage at 5:45 and managed to get to the Queen's Head in West Chiltington by 6:30 for dinner before the WSMGOC AGM. The roads were very wet on the way home.</p>
