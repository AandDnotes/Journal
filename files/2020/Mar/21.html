        <h1>Saturday 21st March</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday we started by walking down to the High Street to buy a newspaper. We also bought some (large) bread rolls in Truffles, who have closed their cafe. Angela also needed to go to the butchers and the veg shop. Both were restricting the number of people in the shop, so there were short queues outside. It took a long time for Angela to buy four carrots!</p>
        <p>I did the weekly accounts, including updating all the Direct Debits and Standing Orders that are being transferred from our 1-2-3 accounts to Barclays. We also did some more clearing of the kitchen and did a couple of clothes washes.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria. They have all been at home this week since the schools are closed, but both Juniper and Austin had a temperature.</p>
