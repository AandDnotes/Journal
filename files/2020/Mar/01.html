        <h1>Sunday 1st March</h1>
        <p>The first day of Spring! Although it was mainly sunny and mainly dry it didn't feel like spring, in spite of the daffodils. The wind was blustery and cold and I put off going into the garage. Nevertheless, we are moving int he right direction.</p>
        <p>While Angela was at church I started by modifying my Journal reader html file to allow for leap years, did the monthly accounts and tried rebalancing the radiators. The bathroom radiator was the only one with air in it, but I opened up those with thermostatic valves and throttled down the hall radiator.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Paul (Rowan was 'busy'). They have booked their ferry for their trip at the beginning of May. Later I started looking at how I could migrate my RC blog pages to GitHub-based pages.</p>
