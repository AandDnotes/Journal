        <h1>Monday 16th March</h1>
        <p>We arrived at Victoria Grand a little earlier than usual. That meant that we could get to Waitrose for coffee before going to some charity shops for children's books and on to Barclays for an appointment about closing our 1-2-3 accounts. We then went back to Waitrose to do a little shopping.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to her WI meeting. There was a reduced number of people there. Meanwhile, I received the latest IET recommendations, which was to cancel events until the end of June. That means we had to cancel all remaining talks this season. So I contacted the remaining one of my speakers. We also had email conversations about video conferencing calls using Zoom.</p>
        <p>The advice from the Government today hardened, saying that the over 70s should self-isolate for 12 weeks! We found out over the weekend that Californian and Dutch schools are closing. But they are not yet closing in the UK.</p>
