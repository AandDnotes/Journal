        <h1>Thursday 12th March</h1>
        <p>I left before the window fitters arrived this morning to go to Victoria Grand. I was early enough to get a cup of coffee and was home just after 10:30. Then Angela went down to the village to do a groceries shop since there was not a lot on the list.</p>
        <p>By 2:30 we had new patio doors and the fitters left. Tomorrow they just have the front door, cloakroom window and the panel beneath it to do. We put back the vertical blind and curtains over the patio doors. Angela also did a lot of cleaning.</p>
        <p>Later I transferred money from my Santander account to our Barclays account and applied for an ISA with Shawbrook Bank. When I tried to move money from Angela's Santander account it refused and blocked the account! We will need to phone them in the morning.</p>
        <p>I finished by walking down to Steyning to have my hair cut. Luckily the barber's was empty, but in spite of my description of what I wanted she cut my hair very short! And the price had gone up.</p>
