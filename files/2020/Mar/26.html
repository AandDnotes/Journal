        <h1>Thursday 26th March</h1>
        <p>Angela had heard that M&amp;S were reserving the first hour of opening (8:30 to 9:30) for older people, so suggested that we went there for our weekly shop. When we got to Holmbush there was a queue of people (with their trolleys) right around the building. So we went to Tescos next door and found that there was no queue. However, they would only let one person in with a trolley, so I went and waited in the car. While there I phoned Dad and spoke to him for ten minutes. We were home by 10:30.</p>
        <p>The rest of the morning was spent catching up with email, producing and uploading my version of a 'town on an animal' drawing and housework.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went in the garden and I went in the garage to work on the TC. I still couldn't remove the flexible hose from the slave cylinder, so I removed the hose from the copper pipe. Luckily those nuts came undone easily after removing some of the paint. Even then, with the cylinder or the hose nut in the vice, I couldn't separate them. So I cleaned up the cylinder and fitted the new seals, with the hose still attached.</p>
        <p>At eight o'clock we went to the front door and clapped, as did people in most other houses, as an audible thanks to NHS and carer staff.</p>
