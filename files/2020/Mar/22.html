        <h1>Sunday 22nd March</h1>
        <p>Today was mainly about preparing for the kitchen refit. After doing the last wash in the machine I unplumbed it moved it into the sitting room. The freezer went into the garage and the fridge also went into the sitting room.</p>
        <p>After talking with Paul and hearing the news updates we were getting quite nervous about being left with no kitchen for a long period of time.</p>
