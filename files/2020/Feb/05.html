        <h1>Wednesday 5th February</h1>
        <p>The plumber arrived at five to eight. We had not got up until seven and, although we were dressed, we were still eating breakfast! He worked through until about 4:30, with the help of two electricians during part of the morning, and left us with a working new boiler. He needs to fit the condensate pipe tomorrow. For the moment the pipe from the pump goes into a bucket.</p>
        <p>Angela left a cold house after lunch to go to her table tennis and was surprised when she got home that the house was warming up.</p>
        <p>The boiler can be programmed through the new thermostat or via an app. However, the app will not load on my iPhone since it is too old, but should work on the iPad. The boiler also communicates with the Hive server, records temperatures and warns of problems.</p>
        <p>During the day I investigated annual travel insurance (too expensive) hire cars and routes to Menai Bridge. It seems that the Premier Inn at Worcester (where we stayed on our way to the Lakes) is half way. Later I finished adding our Christmas trip to the web page.</p>
