        <h1>Monday 3rd February</h1>
        <p>It was sunny this morning while we visited Dad at Victoria Grand. We had taken the iPad to show him a couple of new photos, but he was quite taken by my family history pages. And when I showed him a page about a trip to Dorset he remembered the name of Durdle Door from seeing the photo. It clouded over during the morning and was raining by mid-afternoon.</p>
        <p>We went on to Waitrose, having coffee and buying more than we had intended (although things we needed) and it was after midday by the time we got home.</p>
        <p>After the fist shower Angela went out and washed the car! It needed it, but it was still spitting with rain while she did it. I enquired about the house in Menai Bridge and, without realising it, reserved it for 24 hours for the dates I had enquired. Paul said those dates were fine and Victoria later said they would work for them. I also sent off an outline of the Energy Watch workshop to see if it is what Slindon College have in mind.</p>
        <p>Then I removed the doors of the 'boiler' cupboard and emptied it. Later I started trying to dismantle the shelving inside it.</p>
