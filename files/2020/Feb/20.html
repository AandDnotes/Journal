        <h1>Thursday 20th February</h1>
        <p>As usual on a Thursday we started by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. I took some tools so that we could hang a photo of Mum (as a young woman) on the wall. From there we went straight to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop (after coffee). We then called into B&amp;Q to get some plastic mesh. By this time it was raining!</p>
        <p>It then rained and rained. So I decided not to go into the garage, but did a whole level of Dutch and then deal with the 'speaker' email. My initial requests from Surrey, Solent and London networks all got a response, some direct contacts and some just passed on.</p>
