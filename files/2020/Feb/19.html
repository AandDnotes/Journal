        <h1>Wednesday 19th February</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of the day 'playing' with the TC. I started by starting the car and taking it for my usual figure of eight run, down Clays Hill, through Bramber and Beeding, along the bypass and back through Steyning. This was the first time I'd taken the car out for a run since the end of February! The engine turned over very slowly, but it fired and started after several rotations. Most of the time was then actually putting the car up on axle stands. The front was fine, but the rear took some time. My circular wooden block split, so I had to make a new, stronger block to fit under the differential. Then the wooden blocks that I put on the rear axle stands seemed suitable only for the axle stand going under the rear spring attachment pin. But that causes the rear axle to drop, so I made new blocks and put the stands under the spring attachment points.</p>
        <p>My aim is to replace the brake fluid, which means firstly replacing the bleed nipples. I striped down the rear near-side brake drum and cleaned the linings and drum. I also put some WD40 on the bleed nipple.</p>
        <p>Angela did cleaning during the morning and then, as usual, Angela went to table tennis.</p>
