        <h1>Friday 14th February</h1>
        <p>It was an early start this morning. I went off to Slindon College where I met Gavin and Hamish and we delivered four Energy Watch workshops. Slindon College has a lot of pupils (all boys) with special needs. We had mixed groups since they were organised by 'house'. Since there were three of us and groups of about eight or nine we had a fairly easy day, getting home at about 4:30.</p>
