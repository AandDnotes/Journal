        <h1>Tuesday 4th February</h1>
        <p>Luckily the new boiler was delivered just before midday, so after an early dinner we both went off to Victoria Grand to collect Dad and take him to Worthing Hospital to see the dressings nurse. His forehead is doing well and we got him home in time for his afternoon tea.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon I drove (in the dark) to Crawley, to an IET talk on radiation therapy.</p>
