        <h1>Friday 21st February</h1>
        <p>I spent a lot of time in the garage today, working on the rear near-side brake cylinder. I eventually managed to get the banjo bolt undone and removed the cylinder. One of the pistons was seized, so I stripped it down, cleaned it and the back-plate and re-assembled it. Tomorrow I will try to bleed it, replacing the brake fluid up to that wheel in the process.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street before lunch and to a meeting in Beeding after lunch. We then had an early dinner and went to the Methodist Church hall for a 'shuffleboard' tournament. It wasn't what we had expected and was a good evening. Getting wooden discs through four gaps was more luck than judgement! Our team of three came fourth out of eight.</p>
