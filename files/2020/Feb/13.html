        <h1>Thursday 13th February</h1>
        <p>A normal start for a Thursday with a visit to Dad at Victoria Grand, although we went via the A24 since there was a lot of water around. Then it was off to do the weekly groceries shop at Lyons Farm.</p>
        <p>Since I was going to an IET events meeting in the evening we had our main meal at lunchtime. Then I checked and lubricated the Energy Watch turbines and packed the car with the kit needed for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Then it was off to the events meeting at Bernard's. Unexpectedly he provided a variety of curries! We spent a little too long eating since it was eleven o'clock before I got home!</p>
