        <h1>Saturday 29th February</h1>
        <p>An extra day! With the experience of yesterday we dressed up in waterproofs and boots to go down to the village for a newspaper. It was dry. But it was quite cold. And there was a heavy hail storm during the afternoon.</p>
        <p>So we spent most of the day reading the paper, doing the weekly accounts (or the WI accounts) and talking with Victoria. They seem to have finally decided when they will come over in the summer and what routes they will take.</p>
