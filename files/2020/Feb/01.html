        <h1>Saturday 1st February</h1>
        <p>It was a much brighter day today and dry all day. We had a short walk to buy a newspaper (which has gone up in price), but then spent the rest of the day indoors. Angela did several jobs around the house and I spent a lot of the time doing the weekly and monthly accounts.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke with Victoria et al.</p>
