        <h1>Saturday 15th February</h1>
        <p>After a walk to the High Street to buy a newspaper it was time to catch up with various small jobs that we needed to do. I ordered four Karndean samples, re-invested a Post Office bond for Angela, did the weekly accounts and emailed my speaker on electric vehicle systems.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we spoke with Victoria. While we were talking, Brandon went to do a weekly shop, taking Austin and Juniper with him. Victoria went through all the flight options, but hopefully they will book their flights soon.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, the new TalkTalk router arrived. It is supposed to be  more powerful. So I set it up in place of the old router and connected each of our devices to it, well, all except the Chromecast. But I'v found out how to do it, I think.</p>
