        <h1>Monday 10th February</h1>
        <p>We hardly had time to sit down today. I put a coat of white emulsion on the the walls of the boiler cupboard. Then I took two people (and Angela) to the church for the lunch club. A little later I collected them and took them home.</p>
        <p>After lunch I started insulating the pipes around the boiler and a little later Mike brought the equipment for the Energy Watch workshop. Then Kevin called to check the kitchen measurements. I finished insulating the pipes just before Angela got back from her WI committee meeting and a little later, while she was trying to work out the lunch club cash, I went to the WSMGOC meeting. At that, one of my raffle tickets was the first out of the box and I chose a Mary Berry cook book on cakes!</p>
