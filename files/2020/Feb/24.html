        <h1>Monday 24th February</h1>
        <p>I should have been in the garage trying to bleed the TC's brakes, but I spent most of the day sitting in front of the computer. It was a windy and wet day, so I had little desire to go into the garage anyway. However, I had a number of things to do, including drafting this month's newsletter.</p>
        <p>I transferred money between Dad's accounts and prepared photos for the newsletter. I had another email from the SRFC saying that I hadn't paid my subs this year. But I have and once again sent them the details.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put together the newsletter and sent it to Bernard for review.</p>
