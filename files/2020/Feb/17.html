        <h1>Monday 17th February</h1>
        <p>Another blustery and sometimes rainy day. We started, as on most Mondays, by going to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. Today, however, we took the Westerly route (down the A24) to avoid road works on the coast road. From there we returned the same way, stopping at Rogers Farm for coffee and to buy 'plug' plants and gladioli bulbs. That meant that we did not get home until lunchtime.</p>
        <p>Angela then went off to her WI meeting while I whiled away the time doing a Dutch lesson and reading about DSSS. I also tried to track down a speaker for the 2020/21 season of talks, but had to email the Surrey Network general email to ask for contact details. The Surrey committee may not look at their ietvolunteer email and the potential speaker may not respond!</p>
