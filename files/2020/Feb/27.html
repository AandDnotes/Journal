        <h1>Thursday 27th February</h1>
        <p>A slightly different 'weekly shop' day. We left Dad slightly earlier than usual and headed for Dunelm to buy a new sheet for our bed. Which was fine, apart from the road works to the east of the yacht club (4-way). So we had a late coffee and then went on to Homebase at Portslade to look at sheds and mini-greenhouses. They had a pent-style 6x4 plastic shed, but no greenhouses.</p>
        <p>Then it was off to Sainsbury's at Portslade. It was late, so we had soup and a roll before doing the shop. It was 2:30 before we got home, so it was quite late before we started doing anything. Angela went in the garden and I caught up with email and looked at the Royal Academy of Engineering STEM support.</p>
