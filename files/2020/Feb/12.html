        <h1>Wednesday 12th February</h1>
        <p>The only thing organised for today was Angela's table tennis, which was after lunch. I spent all morning re-making the worksheets for the Energy Watch workshop. Later I checked and modified the presentation and checked the results spreadsheet. Then I checked the LEDs for the light boxes. Four were broken and so I re-soldered the leads, covering the joins with heat-shrink rather than masking tape. I also checked all the meters, one of which might have a low battery.</p>
