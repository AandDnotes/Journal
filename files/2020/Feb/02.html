        <h1>Sunday 2nd February</h1>
        <p>Another day spent inside, although Angela did go to church as usual. It was a more gloomy day, but still quite mild. While Angela was out I prepared a certificate for Tuesday's speaker, sent some email and started sorting through Dad's box file. When I found new information I added it to the family history web pages.</p>
        <p>After lunch I finished throwing out old documents and tearing off bits for shredding, which Angela did. We then spoke with Paul and Rowan. Both Rowan and Krista have been ill, although it only seems to be a few day illness.</p>
