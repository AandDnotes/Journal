        <h1>Tuesday 25th February</h1>
        <p>Pancake Day (Shrove Tuesday)! Dad had his at lunch time and we had some in the evening after dinner.</p>
        <p>The morning worked very well. I dropped Angela outside Worthing Hospital for her pre-assessment appointment at 10:20 and went on to pick up Dad at Victoria Grand. I took him to Worthing Hospital for his appointment at 11 with the nurse and met Angela in the entrance. She had finished! Then Dad was seen (and the rough ends of stitches removed) and we were out before 11. So he was back in plenty of time for lunch. We then went to Waitrose for coffee and to buy a few things. That was the morning gone.</p>
        <p>The rain came again during the afternoon, so we stayed inside. I mainly dealt with IET speakers and other things.</p>
