        <h1>Wednesday 26th February</h1>
        <p>We were surprised that the forecast frost did not materialise this morning, but it was chilly and quite breezy, even though the sun shone for much of the day. The exception was a heavy shower (with sleet) during the afternoon. I was in the garage and had to put on gloves over my dirty hands so that I could take in the washing. Angela was at table tennis.</p>
        <p>I bled the nearside rear slave cylinder again. I couldn't see any air bubbles, but the pedal does not seem to be very firm. Anyway, I moved on to the offside wheel. I removed the drum, shoes and handbrake link and cleaned them. Then I removed the slave cylinder. I was surprised to find that the bleed nipple would not come through the back plate, so I had to remove it first. I stripped down the cylinder and cleaned it. It was in a bit of a 'gungey' mess. I may need to replace the rubber parts.</p>
