        <h1>Tuesday 18th February</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Luckily it was bright and dry this morning and didn't start raining until mid-afternoon. So this morning we took the bus to Storrington so that Angela could bank her WI cash. I also bought a pipe clip (for 20 pence).</p>
        <p>On the way back we got off the bus at Washington and walked up to Spring Gardens for a cup of coffee. We just got back to Washington (after a fast walk) in time to catch the next bus. So we went to the butchers and then walked home in time to make lunch.</p>
        <p>We had a call from Everest giving us a date for the scaffold erection and for the start of the window installation, 16th March; just four weeks away.</p>
        <p>I fitted the pipe clip to a long pipe in the airing cupboard that was vibrating when the pump is on. Later I emailed IET networks about speaker contacts and made more notes for a potential RC/RF talk.</p>
