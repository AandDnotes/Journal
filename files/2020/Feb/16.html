        <h1>Sunday 16th February</h1>
        <p>Storm Dennis arrived over night, with strong winds and a lot of rain. It continued to rain for the rest of the morning. Luckily it stopped just before Angela needed to come home. She had been to church as usual, but then had an AGM, including lunch.</p>
        <p>So I did the usual backups and updates, but firstly had to connect both systems (Linux and Windows) on the old laptop to the new router. The Windows system then, as usual, took a long time to update. The only way to update the EOS system is to do a re-install, which is why I use a separate data partition. Before lunch I tried again to undo the cartridge in the kitchen's cold tap, but failed again, even after heating the body of the tap with boiling water.</p>
        <p>Angela was home just in time to speak with Paul and Rowan. Later, when Angela put the wheely bin out, it was still windy. In fact the bin blew over!</p>
