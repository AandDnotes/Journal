        <h1>Sunday 9th February</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I gave the walls (at least part of them) in the boiler cupboard a coat of primer. Later in the afternoon I gave them a second coat. There is not much white emulsion left, but there should be enough for one coat tomorrow.</p>
        <p>It was very windy and there were fierce showers of rain, so we spoke with Paul a little earlier than usual. It was the same with them.</p>
