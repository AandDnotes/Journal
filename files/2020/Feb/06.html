        <h1>Thursday 6th February</h1>
        <p>The window surveyor arrived before 8:30, although the plumber was later, at about nine. We sorted out some details with the surveyor, finding that the patio doors could only be double glazed, even though the salesman said that everything was triple glazed! He upgraded the glass in the doors and added cladding blow the cloakroom window. He also removed 'leaded' glass in the front door, which paid for the cladding. The surveyor finally left at four o'clock.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile the plumber fitted the condensate waste pipe, flushed the system and checked all the radiators. After we had paid the balance he left at about 1:30. He replaced the top of the TRV in the back bedroom, but the radiator will still not turn off.</p>
        <p>We felt quite tired by the end of the day, even though we hadn't done much. During the day I did order two IET pop-up cardboard banners.</p>
