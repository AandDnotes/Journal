        <h1>Saturday 8th February</h1>
        <p>We had an unexpected little outing this morning. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper, but nowhere had one with the magazine. So we walked to Beeding, who had a complete newspaper. We stopped on the way back at the Castle for a coffee (cheap until midday) before continuing home. This took most of the morning, since it was 11:15 before we were home and we needed an early lunch since someone was calling to measure up for flooring in the kitchen, hall and dining room.</p>
        <p>In fact he arrived half an hour early and it did not take long for him to measure the rooms. Angela then went to the garden centre and I filled the holes in the boiler cupboard, including trying to patch up the area around the flue outlet. I also did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the statement.</p>
        <p>Later we spoke to Victoria, with a brief look at Juniper's and Austin's short haircuts and a description from Brandon of his first week in his new job.</p>
