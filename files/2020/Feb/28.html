        <h1>Friday 28th February</h1>
        <p>Today was all about going out to lunch. It was the MG Club's pub run to the Frankland Arms at Washington. We couldn't take the TC for two reasons. Firstly it is up on axle stands with the rear wheels off. Secondly it was pouring with rain and blowing a gale.</p>
        <p>Angela had walked to the village, to the library and butchers, and came home very wet. Nevertheless we decided to go to Washington by bus. That meant walking back to the High Street, so we were quite wet when we arrived at the pub. While Angela was out, I printed a certificate for my speaker on Tuesday and emailed another potential speaker.</p>
        <p>There were about 20 people from the club for lunch. We had ordered 'smaller portions', but I think our fish and chips was full size. They were certainly large and we didn't need a desert. Not that we would have had time, since we needed to catch the bus at two o'clock. We left the pub at five to two and were home by 2:30, very wet. So we spent the rest of the afternoon sitting on the sofas.</p>
