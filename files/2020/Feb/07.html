        <h1>Friday 7th February</h1>
        <p>Today was a surrogate Thursday, except that we did Thursday things in the afternoon. Angela was out during the morning while I removed the batons in the boiler cupboard, fitted what pipe insulation I had and measured up for the rest.</p>
        <p>So after an early lunch we went off to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. From there we went to Screwfix to get the pipe insulation and some water proofing liquid for the garage wall and then on to Sainsbury's to do the weekly groceries shop.</p>
        <p>Then, after an early dinner, I went to an SRFC meeting at Hillbarn Golf Club. Three club members spoke on scale competitions, gliding and scams. The last person also gave a very brief outline of the difference between 27 Mhz and 2.4 Ghz. I'm interested in all these areas.</p>
