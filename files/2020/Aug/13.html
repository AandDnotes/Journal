        <h1>Thursday 13th August</h1>
        <p>The flooring man, Peter, arrived at about 9:15, just before Angela went down to the High Street to get one or two things. Then the splash-back supplier arrived to make a template! Of course, he couldn't do that because the worktop has not been fitted. So he will come back later.</p>
        <p>I then replied to Dimuth, our student volunteer and pointed the committee to the documents that he has produced, asking for comments. I then collected the images together for my proposed stop-motion and printed them on card.</p>
        <p>Peter finished the hall and kitchen by about 3:30. He will be back on Saturday to do the dining room. It looks fantastic. We then went for a walk to the Rifle Range, going up the slope and then back down into Steyning. It was overcast, so warm and humid, but not hot. We took umbrellas with us just in case.</p>
