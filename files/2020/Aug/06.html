        <h1>Thursday 6th August</h1>
        <p>No workmen today, but it was very hot and mainly sunny from about eleven o'clock. Angela's back is still bad, so after breakfast we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe; a little slower than usual. We were just back in time for coffee at eleven.</p>
        <p>Then Angela walked to the High Street to do some shopping while I phoned Dad and answered a few email. I also fitted the new feet to the ironing board. I had measured the tubing as being 28mm, but we could only buy 25mm or 30 mm black plastic feet ends so I had to wrap tape around each foot so as to make it larger and thus allow the feet to be a tight fit.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela wiped out the fridge/freezer and we emptied the small freezer in the garage. Moving the fridge shelves was very difficult. We could remove the top door shelf, but couldn't fit it on any of the other lugs in the door.</p>
        <p>Claire from Freestyle had sent me details of the prices of each appliance, so I filled in the AEG cash-back application. With any luck we will get Â£400 back. At odd times during the day I started collecting images that I could use in my planned 'Why do things fall over?' stop motion video.</p>
