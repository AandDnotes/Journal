        <h1>Sunday 9th August</h1>
        <p>Another hot an humid day, although there was a slight breeze. So it was a day of wearing just a pair of shorts. While Angela attended her Zoom church service I washed the kitchen ceiling and the painted parts of the walls with sugar soap. Later I rinsed them and after lunch started putting primer on the new plaster. I painted around all the edges, so just have the middle parts to do.</p>
        <p>Working in the kitchen took most of the day apart from a spell talking with Paul and Rowan. We don't know how far Victoria et al have reached, although Brandon posted a photo of the children sleeping, but that was taken before they left from Salt Lake City.</p>
