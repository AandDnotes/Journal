        <h1>Sunday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>Another lie-in. Angela attended a virtual service at ten and I went into the garage to work on the TC's door. I found that I could re-align the movable part of the catch  on the tub and that allowed the door to close more easily. However, the movement of the door seemed to be as bad as before. I found that it was the hole in the lower part of the hinge that had the most play. So I made a double tube, firstly having to file down the outside and then, after tapping it into the hole, file the inside so as to allow the pin to go through it. While putting the door back, the tube inside the brass ball was pushed out, so I left it out. However, the drop in the door seems to be much reduced.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela removed her broad bean plants and we had runner beans with our dinner. We also spoke with Paul and Rowan as usual.</p>
