        <h1>Saturday 22nd August</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to the High Street I sanded the skirting boards in the dining room, following on later with undercoat. In between we moved the the fridge into the garage and then the washing machine into the kitchen. It was quite easy to connect it to the cold supply and the waste. However, we found two clips that hold the sink to the worktop had fallen off. They do not look suitable for a stone worktop. Another thing to add to the snags list. I also refitted the draw under the sink, but it does not always self-close.</p>
        <p>However, we started using the kitchen, with two lots of washing and including cooking dinner.</p>
