        <h1>Monday 31st August</h1>
        <p>August Bank Holiday, not that it makes a lot of difference to us. We were late getting going. It was almost ten before we started doing anything.</p>
        <p>I started by putting filler into every hole and dint that I could find in the kitchen. Later I insulated the pipes to the outside tap and then replaced the curtain pole in the spare bedroom with one from the dining room. The curtains now 'glide'. Angela took down the runner beans and cut the grass.</p>
