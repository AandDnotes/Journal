        <h1>Monday 17th August</h1>
        <p>A day of variable successes. It stayed dry, which was good after the recent rain. We started by paying our kitchen related bills. We paid the two electrician bills and the flooring balance.</p>
        <p>We were expecting a TalkTalk engineer between 12 and 3pm, but he called to ask if he could come early, so he had been and gone by about 12:15. He concluded that the 'synch speed', the speed into the router, was about 39 Mbps, but the output was only 2.6 Mbps. It seems that the synch speed can be viewed in the router. So he wiped the router's memory and downloaded the latest software. He also replaced the master socket with the latest variant that incorporates a filter. I had to release the cables from the trunking and then put them back, since more cable was needed near the socket.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to a WI 'meeting' in the park. They just sat and chatted. Meanwhile I sanded the filled areas in the dining room and tried to empty the radiator, with a view to removing it from the wall. I emptied it until there was just a drip and left it for a while, but then it started running faster. I assume that the thermostatic valve had opened, even though it was set on 0. All my sheets and towels got wet and I had to connect up both ends again. So I will leave it on the wall and paint around it. We managed to get a little more of the wood chip paper out, so there is only the bit along the top that is visible.</p>
