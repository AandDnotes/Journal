        <h1>Tuesday 18th August</h1>
        <p>We were expecting a workman free day, but were surprised when the worktop supplier arrived, with the worktop. This was at about 11 o'clock and they finished just before one. It looks very good. Now we just need the plumber to install the sink and hob, connect the dishwasher and  fit the plumbing for the washing machine.</p>
        <p> Angela went to the High Street andI was in the process of washing the dining room ceiling. Later Angela washed the walls. I had planned to start painting the ceilings, but Angela suggested that we went for a walk an collect blackberries, which we did. On the other side of the Rifle Range we found some blackberries, although they were a bit over ripe. When we got home, Angela froze them.</p>
