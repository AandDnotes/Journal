        <h1>Friday 21st August</h1>
        <p>It was a very blustery day, but the plumber was here by 8:30 this morning and had gone by about ten. He made the waste pipes on the outside much neater. I then spent the rest of the morning painting the kitchen ceiling with the roller. A lot of the time was spent covering up the cupboards and the floor. Angela was due to go to a WI committee meeting, but it was cancelled. So she cleaned the radiator.</p>
        <p>After lunch, while I painted the dining room ceiling, Angela started cleaning the appliances in the kitchen. We discovered that the warming draw is missing a liner in the bottom. It then took a long time to clean the roller. However, we are now able to use the sink. In fact, washing up the lunch and dinner things was quite a pleasure.</p>
