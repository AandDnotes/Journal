        <h1>Monday 24th August</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street while I started putting gloss on the dining room window sills, skirting, door frame and door. The 'gloss' paint doesn't seem to flow and so it is not very glossy and you can see the brush stokes. Nevertheless, it took me most of the day. Meanwhile Angela cut the grass, cleaned the high cupboards and started moving stuff back in. We prepared the dish washer, by filling it with salt and running a short programme. We also found that there is a small leak under the sink. It appears to be associated with the overflow.</p>
