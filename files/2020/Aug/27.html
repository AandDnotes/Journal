        <h1>Thursday 27th August</h1>
        <p>It really doesn't feel like summer. Having found the extreme heat earlier in the month very tiring, it now feels like Autumn. At least the strong winds have subsided, but it has been overcast and rained most of the afternoon. I had to put a sweater on!</p>
        <p>We started with a trip to Dunelm in Shoreham. We took the scenic route, since I automatically turned up the Bostal Road! Unfortunately their cafe was closed, as were their toilets, but we bought curtain tracks, milk bottle holders, a fitted sheet and a frying pan. We then went into B&amp;Q nearby. We found one of the three paint test pots that we wanted to try. We also bought a dimmable LED light bulb and some pipe insulation. Then on to Lyons Farm and while Angela went into Sainsbury's I went to B&Q. I found one more of the test pots and also some more felt pads for the chair legs.</p>
        <p>We found that one paint test pot is the wrong colour and the other is too close to the colour of the worktop. So we will try a darker colour.</p>
        <p>After lunch I phoned my Dad at Victoria Grand and then, before dinner, I made the title sequence for my stop motion video on why things fall over.</p>
