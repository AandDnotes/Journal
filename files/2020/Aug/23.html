        <h1>Sunday 23rd August</h1>
        <p>A less productive day. While Angela attended her Zoom service, I  undercoated the dining room door frame and door. This took most of the morning. Later I did the weekly accounts before we spoke with Paul and Rowan. I also emailed Claire at Freestyle about the missing non-slip mat in the warming draw and the sink clips.</p>
