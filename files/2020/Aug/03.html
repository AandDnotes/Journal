        <h1>Monday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>James arrived a little earlier than usual and will be even earlier tomorrow since he wants to finish his jobs before the electrician and worktop supplier arrive. We left him and went to visit Dad. Initially he said he would not be here today, so we made an appointment to go to Victoria Grand. This time it was sunny and we had chairs to sit on outside the small lounge, whilst Dad sat inside. He was still wearing his pinky red jumper. As usual we didn't stay very long and went on to Sainsbury's. I sat in the car while Angela shopped. It wasn't a full weekly shop, but we find that salad stuff needs buying more than once a week. we got home about 11:30, in plenty of time for James to go off for lunch. In fact he finished for the day just as we were finishing our lunch.</p>
        <p>He asked that we pay him. His cash flow doesn't seem to be very good. I was a little reluctant to pay before he has finished, but felt I really didn't have a choice if we wanted him to put the effort into finishing. So we did a bank transfer later in the afternoon. I then phoned the flooring shop and arranged for Peter to come on Thursday 13th to start laying the Karndene. He is not working on the Friday, so may need to come back on the Saturday to finish off.</p>
        <p>I re-worked the logo for our IET Sussex YouTube channel so that it all shows in the circle and then told Ramon what I had done to the channel art, video thumbnail and logo. He thought it looked 'professional'. Later I went into the garage to look at the TC's paint. The 'pimples' on the front wings are tiny pimples and not holes. There wasn't an out of the way spot to try rubbing them down with T-Cut, so I have left them as they are. However, I did put some wax polish on the dash. It still looks dry, so will need to be done again.</p>
