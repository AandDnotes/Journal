        <h1>Friday 7th August</h1>
        <p>The hottest day of the year so far! So we decided to go for a walk before we washed up the breakfast things and before we had a shower. We only went around the lower horseshoe. After washing up, showering and checking email there wasn't a lot of the morning left. So I went into the garage. I firstly checked the plugs, all of which were quite sooty. Then I turned on the ignition, so as to run the fuel pump, and inspected the carbs. Both were leaking fuel from the hose entry bolt and the bolt that attaches the the bowl to the main body. I tightened all these bolts, but need to get a couple of overhaul kits. I also wound up both carb jets by two flats, so that the front is now on 8 flats and the rear on 6 flats. I will need to start it up and check/adjust the idle speed.</p>
        <p>After lunch Nigel and two staff from Steyning Double Glazing came to 'put right' aspects of our new Everest windows. They tried to adjust the front door (with little success), screwed one of the fixed panels of the patio doors into the surrounding frame and rotated the main pane in the front window (so as to make the 'swarf' less obvious).</p>
        <p>Later, Paul commented on a photo that Victoria had posted. She replied, implying that they had left Davis. After questioning it turned out that they were all in the car heading East. They will find a 'cat friendly' hotel as close to Wyoming as they can get.</p>
