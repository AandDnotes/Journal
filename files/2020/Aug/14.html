        <h1>Friday 14th August</h1>
        <p>Another day off from tradesmen and an overcast and initially damp day. In fact it was wet here, but dry south of the Downs. We started by visiting Dad at Victoria Grand. We had to wear a mask this time, but, as usual, we didn't stay long, with us stood outside the small lounge and him sitting inside. For once Dad was not wearing a sweater!</p>
        <p>We then went on to Lyons Farm. Angela did the weekly groceries shop in Sainsbury's and I went to B&amp;Q. I bought some more white emulsion (for the dining room ceiling), a test pot for the walls and some felt pads to go on the feet of the dining room table and chairs. I also wanted a good quality one inch paint brush, but they still had hardly any on their rack. When we got back I added Ramon, Norman and Greg as 'managers' of our IET YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>After lunch I removed the plastic channeling from the dining room walls, scrapped around the skirting board and put some primer on the radiator pipes that come up through the floor.</p>
