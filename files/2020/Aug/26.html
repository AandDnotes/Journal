        <h1>Wednesday 26th August</h1>
        <p>Angela went off walking with her WI friends. I started in the study to deal with email and to set up a Zoom meeting with other local PEI leaders. However, I discovered that I had already suggested a date and time, but I had forgotten about it! So I had to apologise and gave people until the end of September to send me the details we agreed and set a new date for a call.</p>
        <p>I then put a coat of emulsion on the walls of the dining room. I had to go over some of the edges again, although the roller gave a good finish. I finished cleaning the roller just in time for lunch.</p>
        <p>Later I screwed back the sockets and door furniture and tidied up the room. I also spent some time cutting out the rest of the stop motion images and set up the camera.</p>
