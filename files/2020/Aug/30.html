        <h1>Sunday 30th August</h1>
        <p>Today was all about putting the dining room back together. While Angela attended her online church service I fitted the curtain tracks and the old curtains. I then removed the plastic domes from the feet of the dining chairs, table and sideboard and stuck on felt pads. After Angela wiped over the floor we moved the furniture back. Then it was a case of re-hanging the pictures, although we have a slightly different set, arranged slightly differently.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Sunday we spoke with Paul and Rowan, taking them on a virtual tour of our dining room, kitchen and gardens. I also managed to do the weekly accounts an order two 'suction' towel rails and a glass shelf. The latter, by the time they had added delivery and VAT, was much more expensive than I had expected. Then we had our first meal in the dining room for six weeks!</p>
