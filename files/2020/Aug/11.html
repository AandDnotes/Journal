        <h1>Tuesday 11th August</h1>
        <p>Another hot and humid day. I had planned to brush off the weeds on the drive, but the waste collection man arrived early. So I sent a few email with regard to STEM equipment and event advertising video. Now we have a clear drive, apart from the weeds.</p>
        <p>A little later the worktop men arrived to re-template the part containing the sink. It seems that the hole has moved 40mm. They are due back on the 19th to fit the surfaces, up-stands and window cill.</p>
        <p>After lunch I vacuumed around the kitchen, removed rubbish from under the units and put a coat of white paint on the wall behind the washing machine and at the back of the sink unit. The latter will need another coat. There was a lot of brick/plaster dust, even in the draw runners.</p>
