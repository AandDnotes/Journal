        <h1>Wednesday 5th August</h1>
        <p>Our 48th wedding anniversary. I phoned James before 8:30 to tell him about the dishwasher being in the wrong place. He was on his next job, receiving the units. However, a little later he cam e by and looked at the drawings. I had tried to complete the AEG 'money back' application, but they wanted the price paid for each appliance. So I phoned Freestyle and spoke to Clair. She had already spoken with James and called back later to say that James and the plumber would come on Monday afternoon to swap around the two units. Also, that the worktop people would re-template that part of the worktop.</p>
        <p>This happened while Angela was walking with her WI friends. I also spoke with Mike and Hamish and emailed several people with regard STEM equipment and IET@150.</p>
        <p>After lunch we took the MG to B&Q, via Washington, returning along the A27 and up from Shoreham, a total of 21 miles. Before we went out we ordered a take-away meal from the Old Tollgate. I then collected it at 6:30. Notice that I said 'meal'. We bought only one main course and one desert and split them between us. There was more than enough.</p>
        <p>Angela's back seemed a lot better this morning, but was still bad by bedtime.</p>
