        <h1>Saturday 1st August</h1>
        <p>We got up a little later than we have been of late and walked to the High Street. I bought a newspaper and Angela went into the Coop. When we got home this month's Main Gear had arrived. The only article in it was mine. It was also time to do both the weekly accounts and the monthly accounts. Then I finally found out why I couldn't upload 'channel art' on the IET Sussex YouTube channel. I also followed Ramon's suggestion and created a new thumbnail for Mike's talk video.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Victoria. Paul joined in the call. Brandon has handed in his notice and is planning to start his new job on September 1st. At least the company has decided to give them a full relocation package, so they now have a 'move manager'.</p>
        <p>Our backs have still been stiff, but seem to be getting better.</p>
