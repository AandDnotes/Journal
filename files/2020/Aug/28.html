        <h1>Friday 28th August</h1>
        <p>We were late up and after a shower we were even later. Angela started by walking to the butchers while I started marking out the position of holes for one of the curtain tracks (the shorter one) in the dining room. I used pieces of masking tape to make pencil marks on, which worked well. However, the tape pulled off some of the paint! On closer inspection I found quite a few areas where the paint was not complete, so I have some touching up to do. It took the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon to drill the holes. I found the best way was to start with a small masonry drill, using hammer mode, using a rawplug tool and hammer to help in tough parts of the concrete lintel and then finish off with the right size masonry drill.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I made a 'hook' for both the broom and the dustpan and brush inside the 'boiler' cupboard. I also fixed the iron holder to the inside of the cupboard.</p>
        <p>At lunchtime the TV reception was very bad on BBC 1 and 2. I tried using a different cable going into the satellite box. It seemed to fix the problem!</p>
