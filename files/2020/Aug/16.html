        <h1>Sunday 16th August</h1>
        <p>While Angela attended her Zoom service this morning I filled the holes in the walls of the dining room. I also cleaned up a length of trunking and glued it to the wall to take the cable to the spur socket.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan. I also cut out a few more images for my proposed stop motion video. We also had a few claps of thunder, although the evening turned sunny with a mainly clear sky.</p>
