        <h1>Tuesday 4th August</h1>
        <p>We were up early this morning, which was good since the worktop man arrived at eight o'clock and was here until about 9:30. The electricians arrived at about nine. James had arrived just after eight, but went away until 9:30. So the template was made, James finished his work (apart from fitting the plinths) and the electricians finished their work.</p>
        <p>During the morning I prepared and submitted an Adestra email about the availability of Mike's slides and the recording of his talk. Angela went to the church to help finish clearing outside. Before lunch the power was off, which wasn't too much of a problem. However, while we were doing our Dutch lessons the power went off again. Although we were using battery powered devices, the router went off, so we couldn't continue. We did some reading and I played games that did not need internet access.</p>
        <p>After everyone had gone and we  were collecting the manuals I realised that the dish washer was in the wrong place! From the start we wanted a right-hand sink, but the new dish washer has been put in the place of the old one. We had not realised until now. It will take quite an effort to move it. James is coming back on Thursday to fix some problems, so we will discuss it with him then.</p>
