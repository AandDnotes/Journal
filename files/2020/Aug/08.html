        <h1>Saturday 8th August</h1>
        <p>Although the morning started overcast, the sun was out by ten and, with little in the way of a breeze, it became very hot and humid. So we went of as early as we could, which wasn't very early, to the High Street. Angela's back did not seem any better, so, although she was better upright and walking, we took the direct route there and back. While Angela queued at the Coop, I bought a newspaper and some rolls and then went to the health centre to collect my prescription. It is automatically renewed for a period of months, so I just need to turn up and it is there waiting for me to collect. As I walked back up the High Street I saw Angela ahead and caught her as she went under the arch.</p>
        <p>We spent the rest of the morning pottering, with me doing the weekly accounts and moving some money into a savings account. Later we had a message from Victoria to say that they had stayed in Salt Lake City last night and had just entered Wyoming. A short while later she sent some photos of the barren land through which they were driving. She said they are not intending going to Kansas City to Brandon's parents, but will follow Highway 80 (which goes from San Francisco to New York) all the way to Newark.</p>
        <p>I also managed to clean up the new plasterwork in the kitchen so that it is ready for the ceiling to be washed and the new plaster primed.</p>
