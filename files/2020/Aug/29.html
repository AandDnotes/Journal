        <h1>Saturday 29th August</h1>
        <p>Angela went to the High Street to get a newspaper and some rolls while I started marking out the position of holes for the longer curtain track in the dining room. I then drilled three holes before lunch and the remaining four after lunch. I then painted  bits of the wall that I had missed. Angela also cleared some of the weeds from the drive.</p>
        <p>In between we spoke to Victoria. They were at their rented house and gave us a tour. Their furniture is due to arrive next week, but no one seems to know when. In the meantime they are staying at the hotel.</p>
