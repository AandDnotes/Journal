        <h1>Wednesday 12th August</h1>
        <p>This morning, while Angela washed the breakfast dishes, I brushed weeds from the drive. In the sun it was already quite hot, but was pleasant in the shade. Angela then went walking with her WI friends. We had decided to shower later, after we had done some sweaty things and at a time when it would be too hot to work.</p>
        <p>While Angela was out I replied to a couple of email from Greg about our IET@150 event. I also read the reports from our Italian student volunteer and replied to him.</p>
        <p>After lunch I made a bracket to hold the trim clip on the kitchen units. James has glued in place the piece over the dish washer and sink, so I added a clip to one side, but don't have another clip for the other side. We will just have to hope that his glue holds. I then gave the wall at the back of the sink unit and the wall behind the washing machine another coat of paint. However, I forgot that there is an area in the boiler cupboard that also needs paining!</p>
        <p>Since we had heard nothing from Victoria for a couple of days I decided to send her a text message to which she replied immediately. It seems that they arrived in Newark on Monday with time to have a drive around. Presumably they booked into an hotel since they moved into the long-term hotel yesterday. Today they visited Princeton, which they said was very pleasant, but too far to commute.</p>
        <p>We finally got our showers just before we needed to prepare dinner.</p>
