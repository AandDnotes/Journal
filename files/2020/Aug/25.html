        <h1>Tuesday 25th August</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up and continued all morning, get windier by the minute. The afternoon was mainly dry, but very windy.</p>
        <p>After dealing with some email and fixing the leak under the sink I spent most of the day painting emulsion around the edges of the dining room. Meanwhile Angela continued finding places for stuff in the kitchen. We are getting there! However, we did find a cover plate missing from one of the larder cupboards.</p>
