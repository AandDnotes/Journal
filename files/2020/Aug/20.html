        <h1>Thursday 20th August</h1>
        <p>In spite of some windy weather during the night, the morning started cloudy, but dry. We were expecting the plumber to return during the afternoon to finish off plumbing in the sink, washing machine and outside tap. So we went to Lyons Farm this morning. Angela did the groceries shop and I went to B&amp;Q to buy paint for the walls of the dining room. I was hoping to get a 'tester pot' for the kitchen walls, but they only had one or two left, and not the one we wanted.</p>
        <p>When we got home I painted around the lights in the kitchen and around the cornice in the dining room. The plumber then phoned to say that he wouldn't be able to get to us today. So he is coming tomorrow morning, early!</p>
        <p>Angela pottered in the garden and I reviewed the draft survey, drafted some introductory words and sent them to Oliver at the IET.</p>
