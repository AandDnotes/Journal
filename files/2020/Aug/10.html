        <h1>Monday 10th August</h1>
        <p>This morning we found a photo that Brandon had posted, showing where they were staying last night; the Comfort Inn at Austintown, Ohio, just south of Lake Erie and on the eastern edge of the state. They just have to go through Pennsylvania and they will be in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>We had quite a busy day. After breakfast and showering, while Angela went to the High Street, I continued putting primer on the bare plaster in the kitchen. It was very hot work. I paused for a FaceTime call with Greg and Norman for an hour, mainly about our thoughts on an IET@150 event, and then finished off the priming before lunch. After lunch the plumber (Nigel) and then James arrived. As well as routing the incoming water supplies to the correct position of the sink, Nigel fitted a new lever ball valve in the hot water supply from the hot tank. His firm will invoice us for this extra work.</p>
        <p>However, he didn't tell me that he had removed all the slats in the airing cupboard. So I spent some time putting them back, screwing them down rather than using nails. I also fitted a thinner piece of board at the back. I also agreed with Nigel what he would do about the washing machine and the outside tap. The latter will run to the original position, but outside. The power socket for the dish washer still needs to be sorted, but the rubbish will be cleared either tomorrow or, more likely, on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon Angela had a Zoom WI committee meeting.</p>
