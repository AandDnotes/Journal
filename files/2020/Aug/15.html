        <h1>Saturday 15th August</h1>
        <p>A slightly less busy day today and we had drizzle or light rain pretty much all day. Angela started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper (her back seems to be a lot better), while I waited for the floor man. In fact he didn't arrive until just after ten. Even so, he had finished the dining room floor and replaced the threshold strip into the sitting room before lunch. We are very pleased with how it looks. Meanwhile, I wrote a couple of email and did the weekly accounts, including reconciliation against the bank statement. I also started cutting out the images for my 'falling' stop-motion video.</p>
        <p>As we sat down to eat lunch so I sent a message to Victoria and we had a chat with them. They are in a Hilton Suites hotel on the outskirts of Newark, with basically just two rooms. However, they have already found a house to rent in a town called Summit, just to the west of Newark. Around there the towns all run into one another. They hope to take possession on the 26th of this month, which is the earliest that their furniture will arrive. They have the house for a year and have accepted that the children will then need to move schools again.</p>
        <p>Later I started work in the dining room, mainly making dents/holes in the walls to be filled.</p>
