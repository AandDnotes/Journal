        <h1>Saturday 31st October</h1>
        <p>Halloween. Not that you would really notice it, apart from photos of Rowan dressed as a red dragon.</p>
        <p>As usual on a Saturday, we started by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other things. We then took the long route back, via the lower horseshoe. Unfortunately it started raining just before we got to the end of the horseshoe path and, with the south-westerly wind, we got quite wet. Enough to need to change our trousers when we got home, which was at about 10:45.</p>
        <p>There was then just chance before lunch to do the weekly accounts and to start writing my ghost story for the grandchildren.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke to Victoria. Actually we spent about an hour watching Austin and Juniper play games (would could join in some of them) and then spoke with Victoria. Afterwards I finished my story and uploaded it to my web server.</p>
