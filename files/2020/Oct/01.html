        <h1>Thursday 1st October</h1>
        <p>Thursday morning is when we usually do our weekly supermarket shop, but this morning Angela attended a Zoom meeting. So I phoned Dad and started drafting a reply to one of our IET members who had sent me comments following my September newsletter.</p>
        <p>We had an early lunch so that we could go out. We went to Wickes to take back the small vent grills and buy a new door catch for the coat cupboard. We also bought some compost. Then we went on to HSBC so that Angela could get a WI account statement and did the groceries shopping in Waitrose. Finally we called into Lifestyle to pick up the missing larder drawer screw cover before getting home just after four. So all in all we did quite well.</p>
        <p>While Angela cooked I finished my email. Then after dinner I hosted a Zoom meeting with people from neighbouring IET networks and local PEIs about collaboration.</p>
