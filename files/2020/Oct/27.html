        <h1>Tuesday 27th October</h1>
        <p>A wet day. It didn't really stop until about four o'clock. Before lunch I drew a plan of the cloakroom and took measurements. I also took some photos and put them on a page.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon I arranged for Mike to bring over the third control technologies box tomorrow so that I can take it to Monday walk and hand it over to Hamish. Then, when I could get in the garage without getting wet, I gave the saucepan lid knob another coat of primer.</p>
        <p>I also completed my control tools article and sent it to the editor of Control Engineering Europe.</p>
