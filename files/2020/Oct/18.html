        <h1>Sunday 18th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I sent off the forms for the November 4th talk and started documenting my 'playing' with the Raspberry Pi. Before lunch I also did the weekly accounts.</p>
        <p>After lunch I went into the garage and Angela went in the garden. She pruned a climbing rose in the walled garden and I cleaned the parts of the carburettor that I dismantled yesterday. I also left the cork seals soaking in oil. We then spoke with Paul. He and Rowan had taken their identification documents into Rotterdam on Friday as part of the renewal of their residency permit. I then did a little more to my Raspberry Pi notes.</p>
