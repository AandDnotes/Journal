        <h1>Wednesday 28th October</h1>
        <p>Following an email from Google to say that I was now using two thirds of my available storage, I did a bit of tidying up of my files. I distributed them amongst the three servers that I use, Google Drive, iCloud Drive and Dropbox, trying to move similar themes to one platform. In the end I had more files on Google Drive than when I started!</p>
        <p>My October newsletter came out this morning and Julie Hudson emailed to say that they had found the cause of the registration problem. Someone had set the wrong option. Also, Mike delivered the third Control Technologies box, which I will hand over to Hamish on Monday. The box seems to contain what Hamish thought, although I found a couple of micro:bits (with battery holders), which might be useful.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon Angela went to table tennis and I 'played' with the micro:bits. I made a short video and added a page to my notebook on 'even smaller computers'.</p>
