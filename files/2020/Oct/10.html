        <h1>Saturday 10th October</h1>
        <p>We started with some exercise, going to the newsagents and then on around the lower horseshoe. A bank statement arrived yesterday, so when I updated the weekly accounts I reconciled them against the statement.</p>
        <p>Before doing the accounts someone called to collect five cardboard boxes. They had advertised on FreeCycle for packing boxes.</p>
        <p>After lunch we spoke with Victoria. They seem to have survived a full week of going to school. Brandon was due to return today from Arkansas, where he was taking the place of a breeder who had left. He stayed an extra night and Gene drove down to meet him. Arkansas is the state beneath Missouri.</p>
