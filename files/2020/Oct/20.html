        <h1>Tuesday 20th October</h1>
        <p>Angela took a little walk to post a card to Alan for his birthday and to find someone giving away apples. Meanwhile I dealt with some email (mainly IET related). Then we went for a longer walk across the Rifle Range. That was the morning!</p>
        <p>After lunch I gave Angela another lesson on the computer, this time about saving mail attachments and saving email. Then I went into the garage, reassembled the jet assembly on the front carburettor and re-fitted the carbs to the car. However, the rear piston is not falling properly. This implies that the jet is not centred.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I attended an IET Sussex Network webinar. We had some problems. The Plus4Events system sent links to 44 registrants, but put the rest on a waiting list! Derek noticed this and somehow managed to get links sent to some. Then the speaker's audio kept cutting out. It seems that the background noise reduction feature of Zoom decided that his voice, which was quite soft, was noise. He put on headphones with a microphone and all was well. We were also asked how people get a CPD certificate.</p>
