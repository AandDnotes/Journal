        <h1>Friday 30th October</h1>
        <p>A grey day. It was drizzling most of the morning and start raining more heavily after lunch. We started by going to Leaneys at Lancing to talk to Paul Jones about refurbishing our cloakroom. He will send us a quote and said that John Burns would be able to install a false floor, so we said that we would contact him for a quote. We were home just after eleven.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers before lunch and I continued playing with my micro:bit car speed measure. I couldn't find anything to suitably bridge the foil strips. I tried a paper clip and some foil, but they had to be pressed down quite firmly. I then found a project where they used a torch on each gate, each with a micro:bit to detect the drop in light level as the car passed. A nice concept, but difficult to engineer and it really needs a third micro:bit to receive the events from each gate and do the sums. Another project made the gate from two paper clips that were touching and then swung away as the car went through, breaking the circuit. I adapted this idea and made a single copper wire barrier that is pivoted on one side (via two bent paper clips) and touches another paper clip on the other side. I just need to get the code working.</p>
