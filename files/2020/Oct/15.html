        <h1>Thursday 15th October</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. We were not up particularly early, but we started with a trip to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm to do the weekly shop. We finished with a coffee in their cafe, where Angela met her new WI secretary.</p>
        <p>After lunch I printed an exploded diagram of the TC's carburetters and then set about removing them. I checked the number 4 spark plug and found it still sooty. Then I removed the air filters and pistons, disconnected the connections and removed the carburetters from the inlet manifold. They are now on the bench waiting to be dismantled.</p>
