        <h1>Friday 2nd September</h1>
        <p>We had a series of very heavy showers throughout the day, with quite strong winds.</p>
        <p>Apart from fitting the new catch to the coat cupboard door I spent most of the day dealing with IET related matters. I set out to write up some notes from last night's PEI meeting, but I had an email about a new Fellow. Unfortunately I sent a congratulatory email to the wrong person. The IET just provide an initial and surname, along with an email address. The latter was a University of Sussex one, so I searched on the university site and found an Andrew Barnett, who specialises in energy policy. So I sent him an email, only to get an out-of-office reply from Anna Barnett! It turned out that she is the Professor of Space Science. So I had to email them both to try to apologies and put things right. Needless to say that all took some time.</p>
        <p>Eventually I completed my notes and sent them out.</p>
        <p>Angela went to the butchers in the morning and did her WI account later.</p>
