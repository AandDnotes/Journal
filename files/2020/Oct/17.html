        <h1>Saturday 17th October</h1>
        <p>The day didn't start particularly well. At about 9:30 the power went off; and stayed off until 11:45. We walked down to the High Street to buy a newspaper and a few other items. Angela had a coupon for money off a Telegraph in the Coop, so only went in there. The power was still off when we got back, but UK Power Networks sent me a text massage saying what was happening and giving an estimated time for it to be fixed.</p>
        <p>So we read the paper for most of the rest of the morning. Then an early lunch and a chat with Victoria. They were having breakfast. Juniper took us on a tour (of sorts) of the house and then she played at being a chef and Austin was the waiter. He took our order, she made it from play dough and he served it. Then we all played pirates! finally we spoke with Victoria, so we were on the call for about two hours!</p>
        <p>When the power came on I put the mower's battery on charge. So after our FaceTime call I cut the two back lawns. I then had some IET email to write.</p>
