        <h1>Saturday 3rd October</h1>
        <p>Luckily we missed the worst of the rain today and it was very calm, even when raining heavily. We walked to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. and we only needed an umbrella to keep off the light rain. It stopped raining for a while in the afternoon and so I cleared the front gutter, which was quite blocked at both ends.</p>
        <p>Otherwise the day was spent doing the weekly and monthly accounts and updating Greg's draft document to be sent to our industrial partners.</p>
        <p>As we were just starting to wash up the dinner things, Victoria called. They had been out to look at electric cars and were planning to go back and buy a Chevrolet Bolt.</p>
