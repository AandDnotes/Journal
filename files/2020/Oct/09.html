        <h1>Friday 9th October</h1>
        <p>Since I was in the middle of replacing some silicon grout in the upstairs shower, we both had a shower in the downstairs cloakroom. I then joined a webinar on telling stories with data.</p>
        <p>After lunch I put a layer of transparent silicon sealant on the edge of the shower. I then completed the page in my 'notebook' on creating web pages. I then emailed Rowan and Austin to tell them that I had added something.</p>
