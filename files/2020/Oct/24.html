        <h1>Saturday 24th October</h1>
        <p>Unlike this evening, where it is raining heavily, this morning there was just a little drizzle. So we walked to the High Street and bought a newspaper and some rolls. But that was the extent of our exercise today. I did the weekly accounts, paid Dad's newspaper bill, transferred money between his accounts and moved money from our current account into a savings account. I then spent a long time downloading, trimming and reducing the video recording of Tuesday's webinar. Then I uploaded it to our IET Sussex YouTube channel and embedded it into the web site. While waiting for things to complete I started documenting my work on the TC's carburettors.</p>
        <p>We normally speak with Victoria straight after lunch, but she wanted to go to the supermarket. So we finally spoke at about seven, for two and a half hours. Admittedly some of that time was spent playing games with Juniper.</p>
