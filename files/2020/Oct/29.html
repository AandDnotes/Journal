        <h1>Thursday 29th October</h1>
        <p>We started, as usual on Thursdays, by going to Lyons Farm to do the weekly grocery shop. We only went into Sainsbury's, so we were home by 10:30.</p>
        <p>After lunch I gave my pan lid knob another coat of paint and then investigated implementing a toy car speed measure using a micro:bit. I built a slope with foil 'gates'.</p>
