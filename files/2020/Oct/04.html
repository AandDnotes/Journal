        <h1>Sunday 4th October</h1>
        <p>While Angela went to church I sent the document about the Sussex Networks volunteer vacancies to a number of people. We then spent a while finding out how much dividend we had received from Standard Life (which I did) and Reckitt Benckiser (which we haven't).</p>
        <p>The morning was 'damp', but then it poured with rain consistently throughout the afternoon. Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul. He was having some sunshine!</p>
        <p>We spent the early evening watching the musical Cats on TV.</p>
