        <h1>Monday 26th October</h1>
        <p>Apart from a walk after lunch, I spent most of the day in the garage. Angela went off to the church for a coffee meeting and I started trying to make a new handle for a saucepan lid. It broke when Angela dropped it on the floor. I found a nut to fit the bolt and then cut a slot in a piece of wood to hold a washer and the nut. Later, after our walk, I finished the slot, shaped the block and primed it. I was going to coat it with varnish, but couldn't find the tin, so I decided to spray is mat black.</p>
        <p>We had a few spots of rain this morning, but by lunchtime it was sunny and stayed that way until the sun set, which was about four o'clock when it sunk behind the Downs. We were just finishing our walk, which started by going up to the Bostal Road on the path the goes behind Laynes Road. Then it was up to the snake path, then back down to Newham Lane.</p>
