        <h1>Wednesday 7th October</h1>
        <p>The day revolved around getting the Panda serviced and MoT'd. Angela went to table tennis after lunch, but while she was showering I started the day by taking the Panda to Simms, walking back before showering. They phoned later in the morning to say that the car had failed due to a leaking rear damper, although they recommended fitting new dampers on both sides. When I collected it later in the day it cost nearly Â£550!</p>
        <p>In between taking and collecting the car I downloaded the recording of the previous day's talk, cut out the last few seconds of just me staring at the screen, reduced it from 1080p to 720p, uploaded to the IET Sussex YouTube site and embedded a link on the Sussex web site. I also updated the Zoom Convenor's guide and sent it to Mike and Dave.</p>
