        <h1>Friday 23rd October</h1>
        <p>Apart from a short spell in the garage tidying things up and covering the TC, I sat in front of the iMac for most of the day. Admittedly it was nearly ten before I got started. Angela went down to the butchers and I forwarded Adrian Oldknow's email to Gavin and Ramon. I then spent a lot of time drafting the words for the October newsletter and prepared the images.</p>
        <p>Angela did a lot of cooking this afternoon.</p>
