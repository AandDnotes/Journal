        <h1>Sunday 11th October</h1>
        <p>An unexpected dry day, even with the odd spell of sunshine. While Angela was at church I emailed Freestyle about the missing covers on some hinges and produced an Adestra email about the new talk later this month.</p>
        <p> I did a little more to my article on control configuration tools and later in the afternoon we spoke to Paul, had an early dinner and watched the musical Funny Girl.</p>
