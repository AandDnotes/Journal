        <h1>Tuesday 6th October</h1>
        <p>There was less rain than we expected, but I spent most of the day sat at a computer. After lunch I joined an IET webinar on quantum research, which gave a good overview of the work that is going on, but didn't say a lot about the technology. However, I did learn that lasers are used to cool atoms simply due to the photons hitting the energetic atoms (normally travelling at about 850 miles an hour) and gradually slowing them down.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I joined the IET Sussex webinar on 'making the internet deterministic' as a panelist. I gave an introduction to the season of talks and then handed over to Mike, who was the convenor. He lost his internet connection during questions, so I had to take over. The speaker used a lot of acronyms that were not always easy to remember, but went through the problem with achieving determinancy went through various existing schemes and proposals to solve it.</p>
