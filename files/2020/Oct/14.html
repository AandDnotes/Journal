        <h1>Wednesday 14th October</h1>
        <p>Quite a bright day. This morning I walked down to the pharmacy at the health centre to collect my repeat prescription. On the way down I met Sean, with whom I used to play badminton and who lives in The Ridings, just around the corner from Kingsmead. It seems that he often walks up the twitten next to our house on his walks. The Octagon Club Bulletin arrived, complete with my one-page article on bushing the MG's door hinge. I updated my list of articles on the TC's web page and my list of publications on my 'ROM' site.</p>
        <p>Angela pottered until mid afternoon, when she went to table tennis. I retrieved the TP-Link devices from the garage and used them to connect the Raspberry Pi to the router so that it could access the internet. I also updated my 'notebook' and emailed Rowan and Austin to tell them.</p>
