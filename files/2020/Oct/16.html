        <h1>Friday 16th October</h1>
        <p>We were late up this morning, so by the time we had both finished showering it was 10:30 before I started anything. Angela went to the butchers while I dealt with several IET-related email. I still have some IET jobs to do, mainly associated with webinars. Having taken part in an Anglian Coast webinar, I also created a webinar start page for next week's talk and sent it to Mike and Dave.</p>
        <p>After lunch I printed a good drawing of an SU carburettor jet assembly and then went into the garage. I removed both needles to check that they were the right type and checked that they were not bent. I then sorted through one of the gasket packs I'd bought from the Octagon Club and stripped down the rear carburettor. In the process I found that the choke on the rear carb was no coming fully off. This might account for the sooty rear plugs and the high consumption figures.</p>
