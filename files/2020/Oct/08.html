        <h1>Thursday 8th October</h1>
        <p>As is often the case on Thursdays we started by driving into Worthing to do the weekly shop. However, this time we started at Morrisons, where Angela bought some plants and bulbs. We also stopped for coffee, thnking that the Sainsbury's cafe would be closed. However, when we got there it was open! While Angel started the groceries shopping I walked down to Boots and bought a new pair of 'off-the-shelf' reading glasses.</p>
        <p>At one I joined the broadcast of the new IET President's Address, along with about 1,200 other people.</p>
        <p>Afterwards I removed the piece of silicon grouting (about 10 cm) in the shower that was showing some discolouration, cleaned it with bleach and put some white silocone sealant under the wall panel. It still needs a fillet of transarent silicon. Later I started putting together a page in my 'notebook' (which is aimed at Rowan and Austin) about creating web pages.</p>
        <p>In the evening we watched quite a good documentary comparing Trump with Biden.</p>
