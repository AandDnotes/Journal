        <h1>Wednesday 21st October</h1>
        <p>A busy day, although by the time we had showered it was ten o'clock before we got going. I dealt with the problems of our IET talk yesterday evening. I then did a little more reading, trying to work through the pile of magazines. Luckily Derek replied early about the Plus4Events problem, since it was raining heavily and he couldn't dig fence post holes for the Canal Trust. So I was able to ask the IET to send out an apology to all registrants.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went to the Post Office while I sent more email and then went into the garage. I managed to centre the jet on the rear carb and then finished fitting the parts and making the connections; just before dinner.</p>
