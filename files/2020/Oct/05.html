        <h1>Monday 5th October</h1>
        <p>A much better day, weather-wise. It was dry and later in the morning quite bright, almost sunny. It wasn't until later in the afternoon that we got a few spots of rain.</p>
        <p>This morning I firstly went to Mike's at Woodmancote to collect the two boxes of Control Technologies equipment and then, after coffee, delivered them to Hamish in Eastergate. I just got back in time to prepare lunch. Angela had been working in the garden.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the recycling collection men managed to pull out (and loose) one of the plugs that hold the lid on to the bin. The other was partially out also. So I cut a couple of inches off an old broom handle (the one that Angela uses for walking, although I don't think she will miss a couple of inches), reduced it in diameter, with a bit of a taper and hammered it into the bin. The bin is otherwise in good ccondition, although our general waste bin has a split in one side.</p>
        <p>I discovered that my attempts to add the Exchange server to my MacBook Air had removed it from the iMac! When I tried to go into Outlook in the browser I had to change my password, but it didn't seem to let me use it to add a server to Mail for about an hour. However, all is now back to normal.</p>
