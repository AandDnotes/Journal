        <h1>Monday 5th October</h1>
        <p>A much better day, weather-wise. It was dry and later in the morning quite bright, almost sunny. I wasn't until later in the afternoon that we got a few spots of rain.</p>
        <p>This morning I firstly went to Mike's at Woodmancote to collect the two boxes of Control Technologies equipment and then, after coffee, delivered them to Hamish in Eastergate. I just got back in time to prepare lunch. Angela had been working in the garden.</p>
        <p>I discovered that my attempts to add the Exchange server to my MacBook Air had removed it from the iMac! When I tried to go into Outlook in the browser I had to change my password, but it didn't seem to let me use it to add a server to Mail for about an hour.</p>
