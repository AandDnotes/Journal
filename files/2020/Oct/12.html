        <h1>Monday 12th October</h1>
        <p>I spent most of the day 'playing' with my Raspberry Pi, trying to set it up as a 'headless' computer. I downloaded a new image on to a memory card, connected the Pi to the iMac and finally got the Pi desktop on the iMac. However, I still need to find a way to make it start up automatically.</p>
        <p>This morning Angela met friends at the church for a coffee morning.</p>
