        <h1>Sunday 25th October</h1>
        <p>At various times during the day we had some very heavy and quite prolonged showers.</p>
        <p>While Angela went to church I created the October newsletter within Adestra. After lunch Angela did an editorial review and I submitted it for approval.</p>
        <p>Later this afternoon we spoke with Paul.</p>
