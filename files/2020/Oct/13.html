        <h1>Tuesday 13th October</h1>
        <p>Much to my surprise the VNC connection to the Raspberry Pi worked when I started it up. It seems that the VNC Server started on boot-up. I also found that the VNC Viewer has a file transfer facility, in both directions. So I copied the simple web page files and took a photo to put in 'Granddad's Notebook'.</p>
        <p>Before lunch we went for a walk, up the twitten, along the 'snake' path, up and around the upper horseshoe, down to and back around the lower horseshoe and home. We cam back that way so that we could pick up a few apples from Newham Lane.</p>
        <p>After lunch I had to deal with a lot of IET-related email. Then we had an early dinner, since I had registered for a talk being given the IET Anglian Coast Network. It was about an eco house that someone had built. It was a good talk.</p>
