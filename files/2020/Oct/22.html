        <h1>Thursday 22nd October</h1>
        <p>Quite a busy day. Luckily it was dry, warm and mostly sunny. We started by going to Sainsbury's at Lyons Farm to do the weekly groceries shop. On the way out we called into B&amp;Q to pick up a bathroom catalogue as a start to thinking about refitting the cloakroom. Rather than come straight home, we turned right and went up the A24 to the Old Barn nursery, partly because Angela wanted a pot and some bulbs, but mainly because she had a voucher for a free coffee in their new coffee shop. So we started with coffee and then found some bulbs and a pot.</p>
        <p>When we got home we found a message from Julie at Victoria Grand asking us to phone her. It seems that three residents have tested positive for Covid-19, at least one on Dad's floor. Although none are currently showing any symptoms, all residents are confined to their rooms. The residents don't know about the test results. The staff were tested yesterday, so they are still waiting for the results. I phoned Alan to let him know. He had been to the doctor who thinks he has a urinary infection.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela dug the fern out of the half barrel in the front and I tested and adjusted the carburettors on the TC.</p>
