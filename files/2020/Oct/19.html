        <h1>Monday 19th October</h1>
        <p>I sent off more IET live broadcast related forms while Angela took some coffee to the playing field for an informal WI gathering (chat). I then spent some time trying to catch up on my reading. I finished the edition of Totally T-Type that had been open on the iMac for a while and read a little more of the MGOCC Bulletin, but I still have some hard-copy magazines to read and a new E&T arrived yesterday!</p>
        <p>After lunch the cork seals had been soaking in oil for 24 hours. So I reassembled the rear carburettor with the new gaskets and seals. Then I stripped down the front carb, cleaned the parts with a wire brush and wire-wool and reassembled all but the jet assembly (which needs the cork seals).</p>
        <p>I had a phone call from Mike, panicking because he didn't think he had received a panelist link for tomorrow's talk. I was in the garage at the time, but called him back and gave him the date and name of the person that had sent them out. He is another one who has hundreds of email in his inbox!</p>
