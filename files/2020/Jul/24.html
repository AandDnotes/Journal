        <h1>Friday 24th July</h1>
        <p>We spent most of the morning 'trapped' upstairs. Peter the flooring man and his helper arrived just after 9:30. So we migrated upstairs while he swept the floor, painted on primer and spread self-levelling compound over the dining room, hall and kitchen floor. We only just remembered in time to retrieve some food for lunch. Peter was there with his bucket of compound ready to pour it from the stairs, past the sitting room door to the kitchen. He was finished by about 11:30, but we needed to stay upstairs until two o'clock.</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela went off to Springwells to meet some church friends for afternoon tea and scones. Four of them sat in the garden. She got home at about five.</p>
        <p>I received an email from Stuart Penfond, forwarding an email from someone who had seen one of my articles and knows Ron Durno. I replied to him and he immediately emailed back, saying how talented Ron is and that he had some photos and could work out some dates.</p>
        <p>I also emailed Mike Underhill to see if his 'quantum computing' slides are available for upload, downloaded the recording of his talk and drafted an email to Julie Hudson about streaming talks. I sent it to the committee members for review.</p>
