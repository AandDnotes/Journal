        <h1>Saturday 18th July</h1>
        <p>Another fine, warm day. We had quite a busy morning, but a more relaxed afternoon. We had planned to go off early to do the weekly supermarket shop, but before we left a window man phoned back after my call to him yesterday. He arranged to call at about 10:30 to look at the work we wanted doing. So we just walked to the newsagents in the High Street, via the twitten and Newham Lane. We were back in time for the window man. He will phone through a quote. We will then decide whether or not it is worth our while making and insurance claim.</p>
        <p>After that we went to Lyons Farm. As has become our new normal, Angela went into Sainsbury's and I went across to Halfords to get some T-Cut to see if I can do anything about the 'pimples' on the TC's paintwork. We got home at 12:30.</p>
        <p>So after lunch I did the weekly accounts and then it was time to talk with Victoria. That took over an hour, so it was time to start preparing our dinner, fish in a sauce, new potatoes and peas, all cooked in the microwave.</p>
