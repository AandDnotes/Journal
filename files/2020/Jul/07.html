        <h1>Monday 7th July</h1>
        <p>Angela had a jig-saw to deliver to an elderly lady who lives in Dingemans Court (the other side of Shooting Field), so we went for a walk in that direction. It took longer than expected, although I discovered parts of Steyning that I didn't know. Luckily it was a fine morning, sunny with wisps of cloud and a gentle breeze.</p>
        <p>It was then a case of trying to catch up on some email. I sent a message to the Italian student and and to Greg and Norman about ideas for IET 150.</p>
        <p>After lunch I worked on the TC's horn. My idea from yesterday didn't work, only producing a single 'blip'. So, after re-viewing the video in the TT2 article, I went back to basics and dismantled the horn. I tried turning the diaphragm over (as in the vide), but there was then a large gap between the armature and the core when the diaphragm was on the rim. So I turned it back over. I measured the gap between the diaphragm and the rim, added 19 thou to it and put enough shims together to make up the distance. I held the diaphragm in place without the rim and the horn made a sound. Tomorrow I'll see what happens when I start clamping it up.</p>
