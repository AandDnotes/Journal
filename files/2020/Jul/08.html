        <h1>Wednesday 8th July</h1>
        <p>Although it had been raining for some time, Angela went off walking with her WI friends. There were only three of them, so they went into Truffles for coffee, experiencing the Covid-19 rules.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I did the monthly accounts and emailed a detailed account of the social media project to our Italian student.</p>
        <p>After lunch I fitted the rim to the TC's horn and replaced all the bolts, but only finger tight. I then added the bracket and it worked. I tightened the bolts and it still worked, but the pitch was higher. Then I added the nuts at the back (reducing the size of the large brass nut) and it still worked. Finally I added the tone disc and retaining domed nut and made a short video of it working. I then sent the video to Taff, who replied later with his typical indecipherable text.</p>
        <p>Later I added another page to my notebook.</p>
