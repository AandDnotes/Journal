        <h1>Thursday 16th July</h1>
        <p>We were up a little earlier than usual. James, the fitter, arrived at nine. The plumber came a little later, but left a leaking gas pipe. So the gas had to be turned off at the main. Otherwise, James cleared everything out and lifted a lot of the floor. The latter turned out to be concrete, bitumen, lino tiles, lino and ceramic tiles!</p>
        <p>Meanwhile I replied yet again to our Italian student and started drafting the word for sheet 5 of the IET budget spreadsheet. I also made short stop motion video of Austin's bus and posted it on Google Photos. James left at 4:30, so we went for a walk around the lower horseshoe.</p>
