        <h1>Thursday 30th July</h1>
        <p>We had a day off from the kitchen work today. James was ripping out someone else's kitchen. Today is normally our weekly shopping trip to the supermarket, but we didn't need (or have room for) much. So Angela went down to the Coop. We were both suffering from a stiff back, probably after our tidying of the kitchen waste. I finished cutting the grass and sent a number of IET email. I also started adding content to our IET Sussex YouTube channel.</p>
