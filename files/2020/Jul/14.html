        <h1>Tuesday 14th July</h1>
        <p>We started with a walk up the 102 steps and then up the 'snake path'. My leg coped very well. The weather was fine, so before lunch I started up the TC and took it for a short run, just my usual figure of eight. I turned the engine over ten times on the handle to get oil circulating. The engine then started first time. The car ran well (the brakes worked), but it did smell of exhaust gasses. This was the first time that the car had been driven for 146 days!</p>
        <p>After lunch Angela firstly went to June's to return and pick up some books and then went to the church to help clear the rear patio area of weeds and brambles. Meanwhile I spoke with Ray at Lifestyle; he had sent an email on Saturday, but had left .com off the end! I also re-invested the OakNorth bond, reviewed the IET draft budget and replied to Greg. Finally, I added a little to my horn article.</p>
