        <h1>Friday 3rd July</h1>
        <p>It stayed dry until the evening, although it was breezy all day. We started by taking the long route to the butchers, going via the Rifle Range. Luckily there was no queue at the butchers and we were home by 10:15.</p>
        <p>Over the next couple of hours I sprayed the parts of the horn mat black, giving each side two coats. In between I emailed Everest (both the administrators and the service centre) about the faulty unit and the loose patio door. After lunch we went to the garden centre, originally looking for indoor plant potting compost, but they had none, so we only bought ericaceous compost for the acer and a (heavy) bag of slate chips.</p>
        <p>Later I modified my notebook to include images of curved arrows as the links forward, back and to the table of contents.</p>
