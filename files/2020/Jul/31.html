        <h1>Friday 31st July</h1>
        <p>The final day of the month and the hottest day of the month. It was humid as well as sunny. Since we were both still having some difficulty standing up straight we were not really able to make the best of it.</p>
        <p>James got all the units in place, although he still has to make adjustments. He will be back on Monday  and the electrician and worktop supplier are due to be here on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>So I spent a lot of the day sat in front of the computer. Before James arrived I had added a link to the YouTube channel to our web site. Later I helped Angela do her HMRC gift aid reclaim and 'played' with our YouTube channel. After seeing the IET Oxfordshire channel I experimented with  producing a video of a rolling slideshow, giving information about future events.</p>
