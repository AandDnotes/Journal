        <h1>Thursday 9th July</h1>
        <p>My 'groin strain' that gradually developed yesterday kept me awake a lot of the night. So today was a tiring day and it was difficult to move around.</p>
        <p>We started by going to Victoria Grand to 'visit' Dad. They had a couple of vans in the drive, so we had to park around the corner. He sat in the small lounge, with the emergency exit door open and we stood outside. Luckily it had stopped raining. We didn't stay very long. He seemed keen to get back to his room.</p>
        <p>Then it was off to Sainsbury's. I got some cash (walking slowly) while Angela did the shopping. It was about 11:30 when we got home. Angela drove, since I couldn't lift my right leg.</p>
        <p>I spent the afternoon writing email to our student and to Julie. I also started drafting one to teh IET Sussex committee.</p>
