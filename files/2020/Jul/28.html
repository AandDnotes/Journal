        <h1>Tuesday 28th July</h1>
        <p>The kitchen units arrived just before nine o'clock this morning, a few minutes before James arrived. They filled the kitchen and the dining room! James spent until about four o'clock fitting units. It seems uncertain when the electrician and plumber will return, although the worktop template man is due on Friday.</p>
        <p>This morning the broadband speed was very low, so I complained again to TalkTalk. This afternoon I had a phone call from someone in their communication team, who passed me on to someone in their technical support team. She did the usual checks and finally, after rebooting the router, said that the line was fine and the speed to the router was fine, but the speed to the device (iMac) was terrible. She said that she adjusted some parameters in their system, whatever that means, and I should monitor the speed for the next 48 hours. This all took about an hour.</p>
        <p>I was in the garage when TalkTalk called. I finished making the three bushes for the door hinge pin. I then re-fitted the door. It still moves up and down a bit, but seems better. I now need to adjust the catch.</p>
