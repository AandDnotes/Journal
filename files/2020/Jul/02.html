        <h1>Thursday 2nd July</h1>
        <p>A typical Thursday; off to the Supermarket for the weekly shop. While Angela went into Sainsbury's I went across to Halfords to buy some primer and paint. Two spray cans, grey primer and matt black paint. Both are for the TC's horn. I also bought a set of three small brushes, nylon, brass and steel, and a bottle of RainX to treat the TC's windscreen. Then I phoned Dad.</p>
        <p>When we got home I gave the various parts of the horn a coat of primer, then, after lunch, a second coat. While Angela cooked biscuits, I brushed off the weeds on the drive. I also updated the eOS system on the 'backup' laptop.</p>
