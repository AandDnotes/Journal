        <h1>Monday 20th July</h1>
        <p>The electricians arrived at 8:30 this morning, before we had finished in the bathroom. So I quickly dressed. They finished at about three o'clock. In the process we discovered that the sitting room and hall/landing sockets are on one circuit breaker (the second) and sockets for the rest of the house (and garage) on on the other. Why is not clear. We decided that it would be too much work to install a ring dedicated to the kitchen. We had to spend quite a long time with only power in the sitting room and then a couple of hours with no power in the sitting room. So we eat our lunch in the garden.</p>
        <p>Before they turned off the power I was able to modify sheet 5 of the IET budget spreadsheet and send it to Greg. Later in the morning, after we had gone through the requirements with the electricians and they were under way, I phoned Dad and then went into the garage and checked the rear near-side brake cylinder. There is a slight leak from the rear of the cylinder, so I will need to keep an eye on it. I also removed the temperature bulb from the radiator, put it in a glass and poured boiling water over it. The dial read about 82 degrees, whereas I would have expected the temperature to be over 90. I can't see any damage to the tube going to the gauge. I also looked at the state of the door hinges. The passenger door looks alright, but the driver's door has some play in the hinges and the catch needs adjusting.</p>
        <p>Once they had gone we went for a walk around the castle moat. When we got back I posted a photo and added a note of the walk to my 'lockdown walks' web page.</p>
