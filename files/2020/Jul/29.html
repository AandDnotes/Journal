        <h1>Wednesday 29th July</h1>
        <p>We were up early in case James arrived at 8:30, but he didn't arrive until just after nine. Angela went off to the church just before ten and didn't get home until about 1:30. I was talking to TalkTalk technical support again, since the broadband speed was down below ten. So I spent another hour on the phone. They say that the speed is fine up to the router, so think it is the router that is the problem. However, they have arranged for an engineer to call, but not until 17th August! Plenty of reboots before then. I then uploaded Mike's slides and tried uploading the recording, but it failed twice. I emailed Julie, who replied to suggest creating a YouTube channel and putting it there. So I did, but after quite a long time it said the video was too long. All I needed to do was 'validate' the account, but had to upload the file again. I had created a channel icon and also created a thumbnail for the video.</p>
        <p>After lunch and finishing off my YouTube exploits I cut the front grass and then we went for an 'extended around the block' walk. When we got home we spent quite some time 'tidying up' the the kitchen rubish on the drive. So we were quite late having dinner.</p>
