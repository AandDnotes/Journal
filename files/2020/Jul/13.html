        <h1>Monday 13th July</h1>
        <p>Another splendid day. We started with a walk around the lower horseshoe. Alan called when we got home. He had just spoken with Dad and told him the he and Chris would go to see him on Thursday, the day that our kitchen refit starts.</p>
        <p>I had put the mower battery on charge before we went out, so I could cut the front grass before lunch. I did the back lawns after lunch, while Angela had a Zoom WI committee meeting. Prior to that I had sent out a date/time for the IET committee meeting.</p>
        <p>I also cleaned the windscreen of the TC and applied some Rainex in the hope that it will be easier to see through the screen in the rain. The wipers are not very adequate. Later I produced some more text for my article on the TC's horn. Prior to that I installed an audio analysis app on my phone and obtained an estimate of the frequency produced by the horn.</p>
