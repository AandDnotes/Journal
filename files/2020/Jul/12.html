        <h1>Sunday 12th July</h1>
        <p>A fine, sunny day. Angela had a Zoom call at ten with her church friends, so we went for a walk after lunch. We went across the Rifle Range and down Mouse Lane. There was a cricket match taking place at the cricket field.</p>
        <p>I spent some time putting together a set of photo clips on the history of a horn on the TC and started drafting an article. I also spent some time looking at the two books that came with the car on originality and restoration.</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon we spoke with Paul and Rowan.</p>
