        <h1>Thursday 23rd July</h1>
        <p>We finished clearing the dining room and hall of paintings, etc. before Peter, the flooring man arrived. He and his helper spent the morning lifting the carpet and the wooden blocks. He also filled the hole in the kitchen floor. Meanwhile I dealt with more IET actions.</p>
        <p>After lunch I plumbed in the outside tap so that Peter has access to water tomorrow. Later we paid the balance for the kitchen units and appliances.</p>
