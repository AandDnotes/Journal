        <h1>Monday 6th July</h1>
        <p>Since we only had a short walk yesterday we had a longer walk this morning. We went to the path that runs behind the houses in Laines Road, but instead of turning right towards Newham Lane, we turned left and climbed up to the Bostal. Angela liked the size of the gardens of the bungalows in Coombe Road (which is actually a crescent), wishing ours was like that.</p>
        <p>We then went up the 'snake' path and up around the upper horseshoe, before coming down the steps to the lower horseshoe and coming back around it. We were out for an hour and a half. That meant we were too late to call Dad (it was too close to his lunch time) and, after we'd had coffee, there was only half an hour before I had to prepare lunch.</p>
        <p>So after lunch I called Victoria Grand, arranged to visit Dad on Thursday and then spoke to him.</p>
        <p>Later, after a frustrating Dutch lesson, I went into the garage and assembled the horn. I used two thick shims and four thin shims to make up the same thickness as the originals. With just the bracket bolts in place and opening the adjustment pin two turns, it made a good sound. But when I had inserted the the other rim bolts it would only give a single blip. I added a thin shim, but no change. So I removed two thin shims on the basis that the armature was being pulled to the core, but not opening the points, since the rim of the diaphragm was now clamped and the centre would not move as far. I'll try out the theory tomorrow.</p>
