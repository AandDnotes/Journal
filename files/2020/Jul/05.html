        <h1>Sunday 5th July</h1>
        <p>It was raining when we got up, so we went for a walk after lunch, just around the lower horseshoe.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it was a busy day. I gave the tone disc two coats of matt black paint and made a stand for the iPad. I had thought of cutting a slot in a piece of plywood with my combination plane, but I wanted it to be at an angle and the plane will not do that. So I cut a piece at an angle with the circular saw. The problem was that the saw will not go in a straight line! Nevertheless it sort of worked.</p>
        <p>We spoke with Paul and Rowan (with the iPad in its stand) and then I cut the grass.</p>
