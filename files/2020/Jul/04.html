        <h1>Saturday 4th July</h1>
        <p>We woke to rain and wind, so decided to walk directly to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. Although we put on waterproof trousers it only drizzled a little while we were out. Actually it then stayed dry, but breezy until dinner time. When we got home, my horn parts from 'Taff the Horn' had arrived. I rubbed down the tone disc (as instructed on the masking tape used to seal the package) and gave it two coats of grey primer. In between I did the weekly accounts, although still have the monthly accounts to tackle.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent reading the paper, drafting thoughts on recording people's image and talking with Victoria. As usual it was mainly us listening. Austin and Juniper did not want to talk. They were watching something on TV, even though they were watching on demand and so could watch it at any time.</p>
