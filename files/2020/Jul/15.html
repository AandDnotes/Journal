        <h1>Wednesday 15th July</h1>
        <p>A busy day. Actually the morning was fairly relaxed. Angela went off walking with her WI friends and I spent most of the time replying to our Italian student after receiving an update from him. I tried detailing the survey of members that we want to do. I also emailed Everest asking if they could provide a quotation. Later I had a reply from them saying that they could not provide a quote for the 'warranty' work, since they didn't have a service department after restructuring!</p>
        <p>After lunch we started clearing the kitchen. I unplumbed the washing machine and moved it into the sitting room, followed by the fridge. We then emptied the cupboards.</p>
