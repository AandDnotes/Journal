        <h1>Friday 17th July</h1>
        <p>WE haven't been out today, even though it was fine. James the fitter arrived just after nine to finish lifting the old kitchen floor. In the process he managed to trip the electricity. He left before lunch, having finished for now, although he doesn't seem to be very particular in what he does. we swept up and cleared out some of the debris. The old oven is still connected to its power cable, even though it is switched off at the consumer unit. A plumber called during the afternoon to cap off the gas pipe to the hob. He checked the pressure at the meter, so we were able to turn the boiler back on to get some hot water.</p>
        <p>I finished drafting the text on sheet 5 of the IET budget spreadsheet and sent out a pdf version to the committee for comment. Unusually we showered before bedtime.</p>
