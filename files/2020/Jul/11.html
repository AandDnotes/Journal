        <h1>Saturday 112th July</h1>
        <p>This morning I gave my stiff, but improving leg an outing by walking to the High Street to buy a newspaper and some rolls. I also wore my mask for the first time in the shops to give it a try, since this may become mandatory/recommended soon. Angela and I started off together, although we intended parting in the cricket field so that she could go for a longer walk. As it happened, she met a friend at the end of Godstalls Lane and so I left her. I was back just after ten, but she was not back until nearer 11.</p>
        <p>So I did the weekly accounts, including reconciling them agains the bank statement. After lunch I brushed the weeds off the drive before we spoke with Victoria. Brandon is still having interviews for another job. Unfortunately the one he quite likes the sound of is in New Jersey!</p>
        <p>Our FaceTime call with Victoria was full of pauses, so later I found the 'complaints' email for TalkTalk and sent them images of the speed tests.</p>
