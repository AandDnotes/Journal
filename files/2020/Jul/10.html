        <h1>Friday 10th July</h1>
        <p>After a better night's sleep my groin was feeling easier. I could lift my right leg high enough to go up a stair step. Nevertheless, I didn't go out walking. Angela went to the butchers to buy enough meat to prepare and freeze for the time when we don't have an oven. Meanwhile I finished my email to the IET Sussex committee and replied to Greg about his first draft of next year's budget.</p>
        <p>Angela cooked for the rest of the morning and after lunch I went into the garage. I stripped and soldered the ends of the horn wires, fitted the horn and connected it up. When I took the horn off I noticed that the word 'Alette' on the rim was up-side-down. I made the same mistake. I had fitted the rim assuming that the wire terminals would be at the top, but they need to be at the bottom. So I now have 'Alette' up-side-down! But it works. The plastic horn (also a Lucas) is still under the bonnet. When I went to remove the wire to the control box it pulled away, so wasn't very secure.</p>
        <p>In the evening I added a final page on the horn to my notebook.</p>
