        <h1>Wednesday 1st July</h1>
        <p>I don't think it rained today, although it was mainly overcast. Angela started by going walking with her WI friends. She got back just before I was about to join a STEM Hub webinar about a planned virtual STEMFest. Later I summarised the scheme and sent it to our SLOs.</p>
        <p>Prior to the webinar I paid 'Taff the Horn' via PayPal and then wrote another page in my notebook, this time part two of my horn project, including the short video of it making a noise.</p>
        <p>After a late lunch I went into the garage for a while and cleaned the various parts of the horn.</p>
