        <h1>Monday 27th July</h1>
        <p>James the plasterer (and his helper) arrived just before nine o'clock. They finished at about two o'clock, having just plastered the areas that would not be covered by kitchen units. We paid him via bank transfer later in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>I spent the first part of the morning reading our student's document and replying to him. He always needs some further explanation of what we want. The broadband speed dipped below 5Mb/s so I tried the phone number they had sent for their Technical Support Team. However, it was automated and they said there was nothing wrong with our line! I will send another complaint, particularly since the speed dropped almost to zero in the evening. Angela had a WI committee meeting over Zoom, so I rebooted the router.</p>
        <p>Most of the rest of the day was spent in the garage. I removed the driver's door and found the brass balls between the upper and lower hinge parts. Most of the rest of the day was spent trying to reduce the thickness of bushing inside the brass ball.</p>
