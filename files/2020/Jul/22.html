        <h1>Wednesday 22nd July</h1>
        <p>Today was planned to be a day off from building work, although we had expected the plastering to have been done. Anyway, Angela went off walking with her WI friends, returning just before lunchtime. I sent out notes of our decisions and actions from yesterday evening's committee meeting and sent the talks programme to Julie, asking to reserve their Zoom Webinar facility.</p>
        <p>After lunch we went to Lyons Farm so that Angela could do the weekly supermarket shop (a day earlier) and I could pick up Dad's new pyjamas. By the time we had got home and done our Dutch lessons it was just about time to start getting dinner!</p>
