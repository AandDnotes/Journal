        <h1>Sunday 26th July</h1>
        <p>We were not up particularly early, but it was a mainly bright, albeit blustery day. At ten Angela had a Zoom church service, but the broadband speed was so poor that it wouldn't even load the TalkTalk speed check web page. So I rebooted the router before her Zoom session and then went into the garage to look at the driver's door hinge. The pin in the top hinge did not look worn so I cut a small piece of sheet alloy steel, thinned it a little (to about 14 thou) and tapped it around the pin. To my surprise it was a very loose fit in the upper part of the hinge, but would not go into the lower part. So tomorrow I will make a shorter, thicker tube, just for the upper part of the hinge.</p>
        <p>After lunch we walked our extended 'around the block' route and then spoke with Paul.</p>
