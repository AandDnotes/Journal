        <h1>Saturday 25th July</h1>
        <p>Rather than walking to the High Street, we started the day by driving to Victoria Grand to visit Dad. As before, we stood outside the small lounge and talked to him through the emergency exit door. It was drizzling when we got up and was still trying to do so while we were talking to him. However, we only stayed for 15 minutes and then went on to Sainsbury's. I bought a newspaper and went back to the car while Angela did the grocery shopping. We both wore masks.</p>
        <p>Before lunch I did the weekly accounts and afterwards I removed, cleaned and replaced the stop tap to the outside tap, since the joint that I had not touched was leaking. We then had a three-way call with Victoria and Paul, although it took several attempts to get the third connection.</p>
        <p>Victoria's main news was that tomorrow Brandon is flying to New Jersey to have a tour (and final interview) with the company that has vertical farms in warehouses and supplies salad crops to New York! They have already spoken to their realtor and started thinking about a move in as short a time as two weeks.</p>
