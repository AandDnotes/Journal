        <h1>Monday 21st July</h1>
        <p>We were up early in preparation for the arrival of the plasterer, but he did not come. It seems that his plaster did not arrive! Richard from Lifestyle called later to say that they had secured some plaster, but could not pick it up until Friday. So James the plasterer will come on Monday. Richard also asked if I'd been told how much the plastering would cost. It seems that it will be an additional £270 to £300. We will need to pay each of the trades separately.</p>
        <p>I spent most of the morning cleaning up the floor and bits of the walls. There were a number of high spots on the floor and bits on the walls. After lunch I phoned the flooring shop to check they were still set for Thursday/Friday and could handle the hole in the floor. I then brushed the weeds off the drive.</p>
        <p>After an early dinner I had an IET Sussex committee meeting that lasted from 6:30 to eight.</p>
