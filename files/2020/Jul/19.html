        <h1>Sunday 19th July</h1>
        <p>Angela had a Zoom church session at ten o'clock, so I went into the garage. Before lunch I checked one wheel, the near-side front. It was fine inside the brake drum, but there was a slight weep from the brake pipe joint with the cylinder. I tired tightening it with a few strikes of a hammer on the end of the spanner. After lunch I checked the off-side front and off-side rear drums, both were fine.</p>
        <p>During the afternoon we talked with Paul and showered after dinner so as to be early in the morning when we are expecting the electrician.</p>
