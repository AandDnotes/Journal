        <h1>Friday 3rd August</h1>
        <p>On Wednesday I had ordered four tyres for the Panda. This morning I went into Worthing to get them fitted. While that was being done I walked to the RBS to pay in a cheque and have a coffee, before collecting the car and going to Victoria Grand to see Dad. I was home by lunch time. Driving up Maudlin Lane I met Angela coming home from Steyning. After lunch she worked in the garden and I started composing detailed notes on the IET business event. I sent that to Bernard and Greg for input. I also emailed Mike Teller, who wants to apply to become a Fellow.</p>
