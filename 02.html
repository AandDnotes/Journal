        <h1>Thursday 2nd August</h1>
        <p>I went to Moulescombe to the Brighton CEM department's prize giving ceremony. They started with Maths, then Computing and finally Engineering. I presented the four IET prizes, taking the opportunity to give a short address at the end. It was a well organised and good event and I was home by lunch time. I spent a lot of the afternoon doing the monthly accounts, while Angela did shredding and other work in the garden.</p>
