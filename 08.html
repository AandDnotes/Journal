        <h1>Wednesday 8th August</h1>
        <p>Angela set off first this morning, to join her WI walking group for a walk to Henfield, followed by coffee and a bus back to Steyning. Shortly after she left I drove the TC to a pub, The Welldiggers Arms, just this side of Petworth to meet up with the Sussex Wanderers. The pub had a wonderful view, but expensive coffee!</p>
        <p>We then set off, aiming for a pub near Midhurst for lunch. I was following a TC with a navigator and another TC was following me. Unfortunately there was a road closure en route, the diversion for which took us down a very long, narrow and hilly lane. At one point on a hill the TC in front stopped to change into first gear. I did the same, but then could not get enough power to get going. I only just managed to crawl to the top of the hill! Afterwards everything seemed fine, although I still have a knocking sound when the engine in pulling. My intent to remove the head, after the South Downs Run, may need something more.</p>
